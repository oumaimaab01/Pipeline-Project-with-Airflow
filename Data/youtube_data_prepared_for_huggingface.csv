things but there sadly arent enough hours in the day to respond to everyone ps some of the links in this description are affiliate links that i get a kickback from,i enjoy your videos a lot they provide a lot of information very good content but maybe you can talk a bit slower so that it helps the viewer to understand and comprehend everything i really got inspired a lotnnbefore this i got caught in anxiety and simply applying jobs with the mindset of i just want to get a job to survive any job is okay for nni lost direction and unconfident after getting tons of rejection nhowever after watching the video i realised that it is not a smart idea to search for jobs blindly i guess i should try the third door methodnni know that i am good at something even there seems slim opportunities to get a job under the current economy circumstances ninstead of simply applying for any job i should put my energy and time what i really want to do i can do well and bring values to the company nnemployers and employees are bidirectional nwe are choosing each other it is not only who being chosen by the employers nit is hard to find a job it is hard well for an employer to hire a good one nnfinally i understand what does a cover letter serve for ni used to think that a cover letter is just a summary of the resume but now i know that a cover letter acts the first conversation with the company a greeting and self introduction to the team telling them why you fits them nit should be written in my own words instead of templateish contentni should express myselfnneven it takes time i guess i will be able to get a good job because i know i have something i really good at nnmaybe all of these sounds too idealism but still i am in it hello ali please answer my question it would help a lotni have a question regarding your statement of being really good at the job i have heard about the scenario where people are exploited because they work well for example if a boy works well in a team and there is another girl in the team who is not competent the boy the manager will load the boy with all the work of the team by saying that the girl is not so good at the work so you do her job well in that case if he does his job well then how would he survive incredible tips but right now i am not looking for jobnnmera issue transition ka henthoda mehnat aur karni hennjob to hum kabhi bhi lenge hey ali i never thanked you couple of months ago i used this video a reference while crafting my resume and got into the first job i applied thanks for this video this is all great but most might only work for a candidate applying to work at a start up or creative company if you have more than or years of relevant work experience or transferrable work skills and want work in corporate or tech im not sure how many of these still apply some good tips nonetheless and i will definitely be using the ones i can a person working in rd department of a big technology company and hired quite a few csee student interns i confirm all the suggestions in this video are gold especially kids please get rid of the corporate bullshit in your cv and if you are looking for a technical student position bragging about your student union leadership position unfortunately is a huge mistake amazing video but im just wondering how does making a video or including a headshot with your resume or

told your whole life that you should get the property ladder and buy a home because once youve bought a home then youre saving money and its an investment and stuff and hey at least youre not renting

poor people imo when i you are poor everyone tries to take advantage of you when you make a lot of money renting can be fine because you can afford a nice apartment when you are poor you get slumlords

rubbed yes the ockham razor sure is a great tool but if it misused can lead to a lot of shallow thinking that dont account for storms and traps much of it that could be easily spotted and avoided if you had putted an extra effort and time at the beginning superforcasters are super in their accuracy because of their ability to think long hard and in the right direction for longer stretches of time much beyond what people normally and are willing to donnfollowing lincolns advice you want to do the hard work first so that you have a much easier ride later an example of this is according to tim ferriss learning chinese through the gr gwoyeu romantzyh method instead of the tradition one its much more harder brutal even but if you stick with it through some weeks ill guess to later when you go to the more advanced stuff you will be like my god thank god i started with this instead of the traditional one funny cause if i had to do that i would probably go crazy since i like control of my training help would be good but total lack of control and consciouness would be bad but someone to control my diet would be pretty good tho but i know that if i want to be a great competent athlete and person i must be conscious of what i eat and be dilligent with weightbody composition

a keyboard with keys and hammer action a budget and it definitely was worth every dollar it was around dollars and worth every penny really great channel btw this is absolutely the way not to learn piano for eg do not transpose its a very harmful habit in the long run and blunts your knowledge of other keys nfind a good teacher and take classes according to your goals learn music theory train your ear go through the actual rigours of learning music its rewarding hi ali thanks so much for putting this video together and posting it i have been a performing guitar player singer for years and have quite a good knowledge of music theory although until recently i couldnt read notatin i wanted to start learning to play piano keyboards so i can do more a performer i have owned a few keyboards including a simple yamaha portatone unit with many songrhythm features but never really got around to really trying to learn piano now im retired i have the timen i have dan delaneys play piano in weeks or less and duane shinns week course both of these are an excellent start for learning to read and play and each level of your video shows many of the same conceptsnhowever i wanted to be able to accompany my singing with piano and although those courses are an excellent intro into playing solo piano basically teaching the chords in the left hand melody in the right they dont give any clues to how to use it an accompaniment tool it is the singer who provides the melody so playing the melody at the same time singing the melody would be near impossible at my level your explanation of the steps to achieving this is fantastic and i can already see how to achieve my goals well done and thank you can you compose songs where to buy that piano link please idk ive been doing piano for years now and i think its probably just going to be simple how i learned to split my brain to play both hands and getting so good at the song i dont need to think then just adding singing top of it what app is this this is explained so well please create more such contenttutorials to play and sing do you have any tips how to transpose the melody down when you are accustomed to the normal version of the song great vid btw

just started using obsidian after using notion for years in my opinion is that notion isnt a note taking app its a project app regarding note taking and learning i dont think there is anything notion can do that obsidian cant that is unless you view learning and note taking a project with a beginning and an end thats totally fine but i like the structure of notion for projects like development and tracking the books i read but it doesnt help personally with learning new information obsidian for now im using notion to track stuff and obsidian to learn i get what youre saying about obsidian being more for gardner type personalities but i think it can also be setup for the architect personality semiunrelated but from a deterministic standpoint people with successful lifelong romantic relationships are almost by definition soulmates they were always meant to be and they were always going to be together due to millions of years of events that resulted in them meeting liking each other and having the ability to put effort toward the relationship while who you end up with is a result of your actions your actions are a result of everything that came before you so while there are

this video is years old i hopehopehope youre still doing appy hour i am current confused about roam research and obsidian whats your recommendation why roam over obsidian interesting concept but i wouldnt like to rely this much an app to organize my workflow and personal info even less if thats a subscription app that might change pricing conditions or just go extinctnmost of these features can be replicated by an homemade python script and well organized text files just so you know none of those things are cringe or weird we all have our idiosyncratic ways of internalizing things abdaalnactually i want to bring in a different perspective im wondering considering that it should help you the way in life to either organize yourself or make better educated decisions or simply be more productive these apps can be used for writing all kind of thoughts down you would do in a diary plus they offer the features to find them easily in an associative way building a second brain nnnownn our brain by design filters things out and puts unimportant information to the trash bin thats a feature not a bug and very important to all of us a huge purpose and benefit of writing diary is to brain dump or empty your mind and while doing so you gain clarity and structure of your thoughts however if you do it correctly afterwards you could literally throw the page away the purpose lays in the process your result is clarity and identification of a probable action item or new insight of yourself or your relationships or topics last but not least many things in life have to be decided the go there is not always time to parse your second brain to potentially consider more knowledge for assessing the situation you are in in this situation you need a simply but effective value system to derive the best suitable effective measure just right in this particular moment for this values are building the roof of my life building silos education relationships health finance travel and are freedomindependence helping passion and love nnnconsidering the written above im wondering whether using this notes apps actually keeps people back from living an intuitive natural true life and instead fosteramplify the biggest enemy of progress and learning iterations overthinking nnchange my mind bro stop wasting time with all this stuff pretending like youre being productive all you need is vim to take notes and journal entries your sensitive date eg a personal journal entry you dont want any one to see or legal documents can be encrypted using veracrypt containers nibbles awaiting digestion is such a fun way of defining a workflow its certainly better than new done im going to switch to it so thanks for the idea but now im worried about constipation

called mdds his case became controversial because the medical team and parents disagreed about whether experimental treatment was in charlies best interests abi and i are th year medical students at cambridge university and in this video weve tried to introduce you to some of the issues that charlies case brought up weve made every effort to check our facts and have referenced a number of useful

podcast instagram twitter twitch my online course video editing my youtube camera gear,the music in the background was to much interesting you say the parent say one thing and the doctor say another you need a third party to arbitratennunless the parents are advocating for something that is cruel and unhealthy like withdrawing treatment then yeah youre right but all other cases should the parents choice after all they love that baby more than the doctors or judges nnthey advocating to move charlie to get experimental treatment that may help himnot denying transfusions because of religionnnultimately who is in charge the parents or the doctors and who should be in chargenngreat almond street was just embarrassed that if they moved him and the americans or italians were able to help they would lose prestige and fundingnncharlie gard was one of the darkest episodes in british justicehealthcare during this case i was arguing hard for charlies parents i know the medicine and the odds were slim to none but ultimately this case proved that british people have less freedom than we thoughtnnpeople would say the doctors and judges understand the case better and the parents are being emotional etc but i always ask how many times a year will those doctors nurses lawyers and judges visit charlies gravennjust a point that perhaps the people best suited to make decisions for a baby are the people who love them mostnnusa offered helpnvatican offered helpnparents wanted to receive itnhospital went out their way to make sure that didnt happen and people tell the death penalty was abolished in nnwell heres a judge who sentenced a baby to a certain death or preventing his slim chance of health what disturbs is the hospital went out their way to subvert the wishes of the parent and ensure charlie diednni believe they believed they were doing the best thing for charlie theyre not evil nni heard people compare this case to religious people refusing blood transfusion and the doctors over rule the parents wishes to save the baby this is done to save life not to overrule parentsnnthis is a case where a hospitalcourt overruled parents to ensure the childs deathnndoes anybody else see this dramatic difference herennsome people only see this parents vs doctors and doctors win ni see this charlie lives vs charlie dies why does non consensual non therapeutic infant circumcision still happen i just never understood if the parents had the money to fly their own child across the world for what they believed was life benefitting treatment why wouldcould the hospital stop them from that that is the part i can not understand whether experts believed he was in pain i just felt is irrelevant to what the parents believed were in the best interest of their child thank you both for providing this overview it is very good could you give your view point in covid vaccination of children can i just say the media sometimes astounds unbelievable often manipulative of the average layman who will follow what is stated by the media without insight you are also correct that when dr hirano saw a more recent scan july his opinion then changed but what has not been mentioned is that charlie gard parents wanted to transfer their to dr hiranos care months earlier based scans at that time there was a chance the treatment might have had success but gosh great ormond street hospital refused to let charlie transfer at that time and motioned to have parental rights removednthe legal battle begannand charlies condition continued to deteriorate without any treatment court battles ensuednno one will ever know if the treatment might have been successful in charlies casenthere are many facts to this case which have not been covered by the msm

once upon a time it was illegal to have an abortion under any circumstances once upon a time it was almost illegal to get a divorce today it is almost illegal to complete life and have assistance in dying where are the damn guidelines for purdys case with dpp government should make it legal in every country most people are against assisted suicide etc but it all comes down to what level of suffering can each person deal with and function with dailynfor example if someone has a really bad spine and operations went wrong and they are just wasting away pharma meds and are immobile nthey should be allowed that moral rightnif someone is is horrendous mental health torture daily and tried various pyshc pharma meds and routes and dont want to endure another daynthey should be allowed their own moral rightni personally wish the governments around the world would regulate the same drug they use over in these clinics ie nembutal pills or liquid nassess them and help them achieve this moral right when they decide to have had enough and be able to plan and pass away peacefully in their won homenthis would eradicate these huge fees these agencies charge in europe that most people will never have access too ie gbp etc plus travel flights hotels etcnthis would also eradicate these scam websites claiming to sell euthanasia nembutal pills online and scamming peoples moneynwe should be allowed this moral right we work all out lives paying tax and contributions when we are fit and healthynwhy cant we choose when we want to die peacefullynwhen we are fit and healthy no one would want to do thisbut give is the moral right when we take poorlynthats my opinion i am entitled to that make those futurama things in my city please brilliant video thank you i had to watch my grandma go from being this strong individual sharp woman to someone who was skin and bones who had to be fed by bottle due to dementia and alzheimers i helped my momin small ways to take care of her in her last moments i know she would never ever want this but i believe it should be legalized it should be a choicewith obviously strong checks and balances but at the same time it shouldnt be a crutch that governments have to cut funding to those disabled because it is morally reprehensible that someone would want to commit suicide simply because they cant afford to live anymore suicide should be made legal world wide i honestly believe the only reason suicide and assistant suicide is illegal is because to many people would do it i dont know about you but im not one of the rich so my life isnt good compared to someone who is rich so i feel my whole reason for life is to make richer peoples life more comfortable at the cost of my comfort and life so if i was offered a for sure painless way to die i would do it because i see no real reason to work my whole life just to die anyways i rather just skip all the shit and get it over now if you are an able person its still hard to commit suicide the goverment has banned ways to do it and restricted the info to do it no one wants to die in a painful way but these are the only options left if you are not successful you will have to attempt it again if you become paralyzed or suffer from brain damage you are screwed its very hard to get effective poison sleeping pills do not work because the goverment changed the ingredients hydrogen now has percent carbon dioxide which means you cant or it will be very painful if you are able it doesnt mean its easy

videos of myself and my friends giving medicine application advice camera follow plssss snapchat aliabdaal twitter instagram website,i really appreciate your reflections toward the end of the video i am based in the us and im wondering why the system is so that is years of undergrad and then years of medical school here i think it would be beneficial to provide an option for us students to enter medical school part of a year program after high schoolxanni volunteered in a hospital before uni the most meaningful part of that experience was relating to the patients my duty consisted mainly of transporting patients to and from their rooms for cardiology services years after uni i studied something other than medicine in uni i decided i wanted to consider medical school again however that wasnt my primary motivation i wanted to find a job that would give flexibility to purse something im truly passionate about while also opening an avenue to build clinical work experience in case i wanted to pursue medicinenn i was accepted into a program working in a clinic where they would train a technician and medical scribe it sounded ideal from the outside i would work days a week hour days most students accepted into the program had a background in emergency medicine firefighters nursing students phlebotomists paramedics i was the odd ball the program was geared to look very good experience for applying to medical school or physician assistant school which appears to be a growing trend here in the us the program was very intense to say that in weeks i was drawing blood and putting in ivs real patients without prior experience before the program even though i did it and the very qualified trainers had full confidence i could graduate from the program the amount of anxiety and stress turned out not to be worth the price i was paying psychophysiologically if i wanted to pursue medicine i would have to go through it but i realized i didnt wanted medicine that bad to undergo the kind of sacrifice my own health the program required i witnessed how many coworkers had very poor health were overworked sleep deprived and smoked or drank to copennin principle working in an urgent care emergency medicine backbone setting reminded of working in a kitchen or fast food restaurant although it was efficient and got patients in and out it was focused popping patients out with a prescription although i see a place for emergency medicine and prescriptions the medicine i was drawn to the one that attracted years before in my volunteering days a teenager was the relational side of the business at the urgent care i enjoyed the patient consultations running the tests the high tech machines and actually trying to find the root cause of the problemxathats when i realized i was practicing the wrong side of medicine i really enjoyed working with very smart quirky focused and passionate people very hard problems and feeling the spirit of collaboration and teamwork the serious nature of the work really pulled in a quality of human being who inspired to pursue hard things that are worthwhilennill always remember that time when the president and chief medical officer came to welcome our humble class of seven during our training he was a military veteran who recounted how the military places such great responsibility and accountability young men and women entering the military at in his experience the best of a person is brought out when faced with greater responsibility and accountability i agree he figured if the us gives that level of trust and mentorship to upandcoming soldiers the same could be done in the health care setting to upandcoming medical professionals he said all worthwhile things worth pursuing are hard this is something i recall occasion when i am pursuing worthwhile things beyond medicine this man washes away any nerves i have like a hose a dirty car i like your video so many useful information x i have a question do you think doing an internship in an occupational therapy for month abroad in a developing country to help others can be relevant for med school application for work experience exposed some of the issues within the medical industry and also gave the opportunity to ask medical professionals a whole bunch of questions about the challenges and lifestyle impacts of the career the issues exposed primarily relates to doctors who run their practise a business and those who are acutely aware of the social prestige by carrying themselves with such superiority they negatively impact other members of staff by maker them feel lesser the challenges faced by medical professionals often related to chronic and untreatable patients who made them feel powerless in the face of suffering being overworked and burnt out and struggling to have a family without sacrificing their career by observing surgeries and consults from within the room it gave an understanding of the reality of the job standing for hours for surgery sitting for hours for consult after consult the smell of surgery i wasnt prepared for that one the repetitiveness of specialist consults these relatively minor cons of a career in medicine were useful to be aware of before entering the degree i enjoyed both volunteering and working a care assistant in a dementia care home and a healthcare assistant in the neuro icu and witnessing surgeries but to be honest for it was a bit different what i am most grateful for is that my work experience a whole was like a learning curve for and it helped in my day to day life with my confidence for example nni already had a background in neuroscience when i started to tick my work experience list and have taken part in some studies about dementia so i was familiar with the signs of dementia and the pathological basis of alzheimers parkinsons etc but never interacted with a patient in real life before so my first day a carer in a dementia care home i started crying because i was overwhelmed with how much suffering it can be in such a place i was also very distressed because i didnt know how to interact with such patients so felt that i was causing them more harm than good because for example i didnt know how to ask questions in the right way sometimes with these patients you kinda know you are not going to get an answer back even though they might understand you so i felt that i was putting them great distress and sort of reminding them that they can not speak or move but i learnt to do that and everything changed when i became to feel useful nnbut this was helpful for another reason it helped in my next job more than i thought which was in a neurological intensive care unit i used to be a very weak person in the sense that i was fainting every time i was seeing a person having a seizure or having a painful injury so obviously i wasnt going to be any good to a patient if i was fainting but because i become used sort of speak with a degree of patient suffering i found it easier to adapt to see patients having awful injuries coming straight away from ed or surgical theatres for the record i almost fainted when seeing patient intubationnnbut this prepared for the next step which was to witness a cardiac surgery and bypass basically i witnessed a patient being cut in half with the surgeons digging inside his body and try to lift the heart and put some tissues inside him to deal with the bleeding my family couldnt believe that i was able to see this after always telling i cant be a doctor because i am too softnnso for my work experience did help to grow a person and gain a lot more confidence in myself but i appreciate volunteering just much but for different reasons what if you didnt get the opportunity of getting work experiance but have done volunteer works can i still apply to med school i sort of agree with you the expectation of applicants to do hospital work experience and have moments of clarity that suddenly lead them to wanting to become a dr i can attest to spending weeks a ward following fy doctors around when i was being pretty much useless in terms of fully understanding the role and expectations of doctors is it an age thing however a grad ive been working in a hospital for years now in a hca and more developed role where ive been able to work alongside drs nurses and other healthcare professionals and i can tell you ive learnt an incredible amount and definitely feel more informed about my decision to pursue a place a grad entry course i dont really think i could take much of an insight and relevant experience if i was volunteering in a different area my paid role has allowed to really get stuck in and develop skills and confidence in speaking to patients and contributing to their care rather than spending a small amount of time with patients a semiregular basis pros and cons of each i suppose katherine is the best omg ali is so ugly and video still applies to preparing for my radiology interview thanks for the great free content
