<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims to master the design and implementation of data pipelines using Apache Airflow. Data pipelines are essential for automating and orchestrating tasks related to data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). In addition to using Airflow, this project explores containerization with Docker, data ingestion and aggregation with Apache NiFi, as well as the application of Hugging Face machine learning models for summarization, sentiment analysis, and text-to-speech conversion.

Analyzing the interactions and dynamics of YouTube channels is crucial in the current context, where content creators are playing an increasingly influential role. This project focuses on the extraction, preparation, and analysis of data from several popular YouTube channels in the fields of data science and programming. The goal is to explore the most engaging types of content, understand viewersâ€™ reactions through comments, and identify trends and engagement patterns. By obtaining an overview of key metrics from videos and channels, we can better understand the factors that contribute to the success of a YouTube channel.
