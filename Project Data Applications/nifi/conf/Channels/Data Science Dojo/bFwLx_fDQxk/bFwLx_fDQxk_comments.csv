@BigAsciiHappyStar,2024-05-01T00:36:37Z,0,"Many thanks for this interview. I am happy that Luis has found his true calling and can attest the Machine Learning community needs more people like him.  Unfortunately, the general understanding of ML is much, much less than it should be. Many teachers would struggle to explain a concept in simple terms and programmers are probably worse. Yesterday I was playing with someone’s GitHub code that was last updated in December 2023. Two weeks ago, someone opened an issue “where is main dot py?” I had the same question and couldn’t find a satisfactory answer either. The same author has at least one other popular repository that I was less than impressed with.  And yes, I have watched THAT video. Unfortunately, my puzzle “Slanted Land – The Sudoku!” is probably not appearing on Cracking The Cryptic any time soon!",True
