@satijena5790,2023-07-24T09:34:02Z,0,"Excellent explanation and easy to understand step by step guidance. Just wondering you have missed the validation part of this trained model. Do you have a separate video on this please? Also, I am interested to learn more the various type of ML models ( you have explained Classification and Regression only)? Do you have Boot camp classes in UK?",True

@efyoubadly,2020-10-15T06:24:02Z,0,"in the end just add 'Score model' and connect 'Trained model o/p data to the left part of 'score model' and right part of the score model to the test data from split data.( which is 0.3 ) . Now in the score model visualize, you will get last two columns.. with the actual test data result and probability obtained from the Trained model. If its value close to the test data model works fine. ( Try to increase depth of the tree to get more accurate result ). for eg. 32 ( Don't make it too large )",True

@ranfuchs3592,2020-03-22T02:42:16Z,0,"Thank you for another great lesson. Naturally, my tree and yours were different, this is the reason you need a forest after all. But I have a question. Whether I click on the right branch of a node or the left one, the description in the stat column remains the same. That is, by reading the stat report alone, I cannot tell whether I took the yes or no answer, and I always need to refer back to the tree.  I could not see it in your video as you consistently selected 'no'. But is that something I am doing wrong, or is it they was you would expect the system to behave?",True
@krishnabala8403,2020-01-27T00:17:58Z,0,Great course! Well done. A fabulous practical introduction to the basics of ML! Thank you.,True

@ralphmaas3448,2019-09-04T22:21:17Z,3,Hi. Great tutorials. But the serie is not finnished. Is it?  Any follow up?,True
@EarthianZero,2019-07-28T15:54:26Z,2,Great series! I came here right after attending a Google event on ML. This series really simplified a lot of topics mentioned during the event and it made me want to practice using Microsoft ML studio vs Google TensorFlow,True

@filipvagenende7483,2017-12-24T11:08:53Z,3,"An interesting series as introduction on Azure ML.  There is no part 11? The interesting part, evaluations and conclusions are missing now...  I've done some tests and it looks like there is no real good prediction left, when you also remove the DepDelay from the input features. And predicting an arrival delay when you already know there is a departure delay is no rocket science of course.  Thanks for the video series!",True
@alikhaki,2017-09-17T21:16:27Z,0,"Thanks for the video. However, when i create and run the model as described at around 12:23. My first question is DepDelay <1, as opposed to DepTimeBlk170. Have i selected an incorrect field somewhere?",True
