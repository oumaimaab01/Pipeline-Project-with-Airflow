One question: at the end of this video you do give the disclaimer that for purposes of time you were only demonstrating with subset dataframes. So then if one is working with very large datasets, would these joins in R still be recommended or would you recommend some other method?",True
@gregorkvas6332,2018-02-18T21:42:32Z,2,"Dear Presentator! Thx for the intro series to dplyr. I liked the Tutorial dataset, since my home country, Austria, can be seen on the top ranks, that you built with the dplyr functions...:-) A few thoughts though: 1. Following an already coded syntax, which is organized via comments in the syntax editor of RStudio, would be much easier to follow (like in the ML/caret Tutorial on your channel by Dave Langer), than just using the R console, where there is no code highlighting either. 2. A stepwise introduction to the dplyr functions and the results they produce would be more transparent before starting with pretty long pipe-statements, where these functions get connected. 3. Concerning the shown join-functions the possibility of defining the primary key via the ‚by‘ statement is painfully missing and therefore the default key was not quite clear. Thx again for your efforts and this great channel. Sincerely, Gregory",True
