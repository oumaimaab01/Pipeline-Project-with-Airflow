@physicsfaith,2024-02-14T16:23:11Z,0,"I don't know if this gets fixed later in the video but there is a problem with the converted dates. He started off with ddmmyy format in Date when it was an object format. He ran pd.to_datetime which has converted it to yyyymmdd format. When you look, at 15:41 for example, you can see that it converted the Jan 2, 2018 date (the second data row) to 2018-02-01, which is Feb 1, 2018. If you doubt that look at row 3239. The date is 2020-12-16. The middle value is the month, not the day that he claims. So the time series is now all jumbled up in addition to having the wrong dates.",True

@sandraoriji8351,2023-10-23T11:58:44Z,0,"Hello, I tried this on another dataset but i am a little confused. Before creating my model using Prophet my data shape was 3201 rows but after fitting the model m.fit(df), the shape reduced to 1203, and my period is period = 365 and freq = 'D'. But when I plot my predicted data the 365 days added can be seen. Is this normal? From the video, the shape of your data decreased after fitting.",True
@sandraoriji8351,2023-10-18T13:52:30Z,0,"Awesome Video, but I have a question. Why do you have to filter the dataframe (frame) to build the model? Why no use the whole dataset (df) to build the model. Is there a specific reason?",True
