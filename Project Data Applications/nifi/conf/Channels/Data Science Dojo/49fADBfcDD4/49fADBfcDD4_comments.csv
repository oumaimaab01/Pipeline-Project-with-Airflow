@punchline9131,2019-12-20T12:37:14Z,0,"I would like to use ""ggplot2"" to create a graph showing whether life satisfaction returns to the value it had before the unemployment event occurred. Unemployment I have coded with 0 = not unemployed and 1 = unemployed.  General life satisfaction is coded 0 - 10.  I have already created the data set df_emp with a subset command, which contains all persons who were unemployed at least once.  It also contains all years of observation of these persons.  So all years before, during and after unemployment, as well as the corresponding values for life satisfaction   The years before, during and after the event should now be entered on the x-axis.  Where 0 is the event unemployment.  The values -1 -2 and 1 2 etc. show values for the years before and after unemployment. On the y-axis the values for life satisfaction should then be deducted (centered).     Unfortunately, I can't manage to model this graphic in R and would therefore be very pleased if somebody could help me or give me some tips on how to proceed.   Best regards   ps.
