@merrimac1,2020-03-02T03:22:52Z,2,"The instructor need to work on his coding style. It's not a good practice to put everything in a one line. break it to several lines please. it'll be much clearer. He also did not have to highlight the command and click ""Run"". Just click Run, the current line will be executed. or simply do ""ctrl enter""! It's painful to see him doing that!   It's easy to change the scale of y-axis, ylim would to the trick. To be honest,  the instructor doesn't look like a very experienced R programmer.",True
