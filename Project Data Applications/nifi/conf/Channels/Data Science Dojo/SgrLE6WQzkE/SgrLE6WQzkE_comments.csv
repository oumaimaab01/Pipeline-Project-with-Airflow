@rafaelsilva8704,2019-05-10T21:54:52Z,1,I started the series today and I'm addicted to it... Congratulations on your work! I'm already a fan!,True
@PCI208,2019-01-02T11:26:00Z,1,"hey I need help, I want to do confusionmatrix on rpart.cv.2 and I use the code confusionMatrix(train.tokens.tfidf.df$Label, rpart.cv.2$finalModel$predicted) then Error: `data` and` reference` appear should be factors with the same levels  any suggestions for my problem?  thank you",True
@WorldAroundWe,2018-11-02T03:45:35Z,0,"Hi Dave, your videos are great. one quick questions. if we have more than 2 variables and there by multi dimensional confusion matrix then how are we going to deal with the Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity",True
@farhanamim3068,2018-09-16T14:47:27Z,0,I can't run rf.cv.1 function please anyone can help me?,True
@AmitYadav-zk8zm,2018-04-08T23:22:10Z,0,"Thanks a lot Dave for these, immensely helpful.  One correction, the correct confusion matrix command should have been  confusionMatrix(rf.cv.1$finalModel$predicted,train.svd$Label)  instead of   confusionMatrix(train.svd$Label, rf.cv.1$finalModel$predicted)  as data is the first param and reference is the second. And hence, spam precision is good but spam recall is poor, rather than the other way round.",True

@mbeekink,2017-11-18T11:49:20Z,0,"Hi Dave, you are talking about loading your cached results. How can I cache results myself? For my own project it seems caching results will save me a lot of time when I want to return to my own generated results.",True
@terrybrooks9514,2017-11-04T15:37:37Z,0,"Hi Dave, I am running through the videos and applying this to the random acts of pizza dataset from kaggle. I am up to the point on running random forest on the train.svd and viewing the results. I have used the same stratified splits as in the videos. This data comes out at roughly 75/25. However, when I view the resulting confusion matrix it looks like this.   I expected a common split on the reference but this is way off. Am I doing something wrong or is my expectation incorrect, and this is more to do with the quality of the model so far? Appreciate any tips.             Reference Prediction FALSE TRUE      FALSE  2123   10      TRUE    692    4",True
@archowdhury007,2017-10-04T02:54:53Z,10,"Hi Dave, absolutely loved the video series!!!!. I haven't seen ANY other tutorial that goes into so much depth and walks step-by-step through such a problem. Great work!. Please do keep sharing more such videos.",True
@shobhamourya8396,2017-09-14T03:48:22Z,0,"Hi Dave,  Sensitivity is ratio of correct ham predictions over actual total ham values Not over total ham predictions. The column totals are the actual correct values and rows are the total predictions for the corresponding label class. Your formula is correct but what you said @8:04 was different. You defined Precision which is correct ham predictions over total ham predictions (row total).  Similarly, Specificity is ratio of correct spam predictions over actual total spam values ( second column total) Not total spam predictions (second row total). I hope I've not confused you - I'm pointing out the difference between total predictions and total values...  Please refer to my website:  http://www.nosimpler.me/accuracy-precision/",True
@rajeshwaran001,2017-08-15T11:42:35Z,1,"When using the Confusion Matrix, i believe we would have to be careful on the order of the actual and predicted parameters that go into the function.. What i mean is confusionMatrix (actual, predicted) would yield different results compared to confusionMatrix(actual,predicted) - is that correct ?",True
@BhakthiLiyanage,2017-08-07T13:56:16Z,6,"Hi Dave, This is one of the best tutorials I ever have seen. thank you very much. I was wondering if you have any plans to cover test the model with test data and eventually how to put this in to production?",True
