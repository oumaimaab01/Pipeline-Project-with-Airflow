All the new web tools my (large) company or new benefits groups have put out in the last ~3 years have seemed more and more like a Lego video game: you‚Äôve got to click all the text bc the hyperlinks aren‚Äôt obvious, look carefully and explore all the text because of fancy picture & explanations vs simple titles or obvious organization, scroll way down on ever page, and explore all the hidden menus, because nothing is simply presented, and everything requires multiple clicks, even common actions.",True

@ZanetDesign,2022-06-30T19:41:34Z,0,"Hi  Here is a question that I just can't find an answer to regarding thumbnail split testing.  when is the best time to split test thumbnails? I use Tubebuddy for split testing my thumbnails right from day one. But im worried im doing something wrong and getting unreliable results. here is my process... 1. I design 2 thumbnails that I think will work. 2. I release the video to the public with my thumbnail A 3. I now splittest to thumbnail B and rotate daily 4. I let it run until a winner produces a statistical significance   here is the 2 questions no one seems to consider or answer  A) Isn't the first few days an unrealistic test as the first 24 hours the CTR is not relevent to the thumbnail but is more due to alerts and subscribers seeing you have a new video out. This is almost impossible fairness as a split test goes, so my gut feeling is don't split test in the first week to avoid this.  B)  the fact that a thumbnail has potentially 2 very different audiences also makes split testing irrelevant. if my video is for search, the audience AND CTR is totally different to the suggested video audience.  Question how do you deal with A and B? so what and how is this meant to be handled, what do you do to allow for and address both these realistic scientific approaches to CTR?  any response would be appreciated  Your biggest fan Zane Zanet Design https://youtube.com/c/ZanetDesign",True
