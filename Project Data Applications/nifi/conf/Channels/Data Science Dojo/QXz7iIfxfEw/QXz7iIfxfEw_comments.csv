Categories (form, syntax, objects) are dual to sets (substance, semantics, subjects) -- Category theory. Large language models are using duality. If mathematics is a language then it is dual. All numbers fall withing the complex plane. Real is dual to imaginary -- complex numbers are dual. All numbers are therefore dual. The integers are self dual as they are their own conjugates. Information is dual to co or mutual information -- information is dual. Potential or imaginary information (entropy) is dual to kinetic or real information (syntropy). Potential energy is dual to kinetic energy -- gravitational energy is dual. Average information (entropy) is dual to mutual information (syntropy). Mutual information (syntropy) allows for predictions to be made more accurate than chance or randomness! Syntropy (prediction) is dual to increasing entropy -- the 4th law of thermodynamics! Teleological physics (syntropy) is dual to non teleological physics (entropy). Converting information into mutual information is a syntropic process -- teleological. ""Through imagination and reason we turn experience into foresight (prediction)"" -- Spinoza describing syntropy. ""Always two there are"" -- Yoda, ""The brain is a prediction machine"" -- Karl Friston, neuroscientist. Making predictions is a syntropic process -- teleological.",True
