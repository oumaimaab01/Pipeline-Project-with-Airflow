@michelesantos5716,2020-12-25T15:46:55Z,2,"Thank you, Shanif. This video was very informative and inspirational as well. I'm currently taking a BS in Data Management/Analytics (it's technically a DS degree) online. I'm graduating next year and hopefully I can land a job as soon as I graduate. :) The timing of me finding this video was perfect. I've been doubting myself lately thinking I'm making a mistake switching careers now. This video was encouraging and it just affirms that I indeed made the right decision. Data Science is what I want do until I retire. Thanks again.",True
