Check the documentation by typing ?nchar() into the console.  NOTE: doing this *will give you different results when you use the summary() function on this new feature.* That is simply because you're allowing NAs to be counted (I think?). It doesn't change that much though from what's in the video. If someone has a better fix or idea on how to deal with this please comment below with your reply.   You're welcome :)",True
