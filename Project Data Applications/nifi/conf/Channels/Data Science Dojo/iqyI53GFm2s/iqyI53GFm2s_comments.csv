@GaneshKrishnan,2015-10-22T02:38:49Z,0,"2.54 - 3.06 is bit confusing.  The split on the right, splits it into 90 & 10 percent. The first output is 90%. The child split for this first output should split 60-30 so I would assume it should directly be 60-30 since it's input is already only 90% (from the parent). Confusing?",True
