@DanielWeikert,2017-12-31T12:55:14Z,4,Why do you train on 100% of your data. Even after cross validation you basically ignore your original model and train a complete new one. So with 100% of data you cannot ensure that your model gets worse than before can you? Thx,True
@terrybrooks9514,2017-12-29T19:21:43Z,0,"Hi, I’m following your process for the “random acts of pizza” dataset from Kaggle.  In the model building I get around 75% accuracy which is matched with 10 fold cross validation with a variance of 1% either way. However after building the model on all train data and applying to the test set I get just a 52% accuracy score when submitted to Kaggle. If I am sure that I am following the steps correctly does this just in the card that my model is overfitting the train data?",True
