While running the code, i'm unable to find createDataPartition function in my R studio even though i have installed caret package.  When I execute the command - library(caret) i get this error:  Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘caret’ in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):  there is no package called ‘SparseM’  Kindly help resolve this issue.

I decided to tackle with text data of my native language Sadly quantida doesn't support my language (polish).

I have array containing core and generally written word but i have problems with applying the stem to my tokens. I tried asking stack overflow but without any success.",True

@PSNzzirGrizzHD,2017-07-13T07:06:13Z,2,"Hey dave! I've been watching your videos ever since the Titanic data set, which really got me into using R and data science! I love the way you teach, its simple and too the point! I love how you apply and acknowledge the 80/20 rule. I was thinking about learning python to do some data analytics as well, but your videos just seem to overpower my decision to switch from R to python.   I have a question tho. In your opinion, how do you value data science bootcamps in regards to job preperation? Is there any benefits to learning python than R?   Thanks again for all the work you put into your videos. It's 12am right now and I'm eating oatmeal while watching this haha!",True
@Jayl__,2017-07-09T19:39:48Z,2,I love how you explain things so clearly! More text analysis videos please! :).. I'm going to watch the other ones but I hope you go through how to use different lexicons and other classifiers like Naive Bayes for theme analysis. Anyways thank you so much!,True
