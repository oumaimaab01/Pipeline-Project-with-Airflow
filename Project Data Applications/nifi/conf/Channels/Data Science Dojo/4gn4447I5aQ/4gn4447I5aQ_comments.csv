I am trying to test a data that has hotel only as categorical, the rest e.g. Net Revenue, Conversion, Number of Guest are all Numeric, at least I think. So I'm kinda stuck on this lesson and could not move on because the system is considering the rest of my data as string. Is there an appendix for all the terms that will be used on the lessons here? Many thanks!",True
