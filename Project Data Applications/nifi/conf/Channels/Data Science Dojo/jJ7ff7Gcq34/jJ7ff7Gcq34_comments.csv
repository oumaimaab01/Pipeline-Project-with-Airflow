@adamtki,2023-09-26T02:03:19Z,0,"1:02 After several listens, I realized you're saying ""bananas IN apples"" instead of ""bananas AND apples"".  If you speak these essential words more clearly and lower that music, it'll be easier to understand.  Also, it's not clear which side of the equal sign is your prediction and which side is the truth.  You should call that out when presenting the diagram.",True

@hummingbird5964,2023-08-20T12:06:52Z,2,"our sir was teaching this in class, and he took the same example when explaining this. He said you don't want to risk a life on short confidence interval for spotting cancer. It was Probability class, and it is nice to see that concept being applied here. I don;t know how they are linked, but they sure are. by that insight, Recall suited better here as larger confidence intervals will consider those cells that are suscipicious enough to be of cancer disease. so yeah",True
@theMiaow,2023-07-19T16:59:53Z,2,"Precision -> it focuses more on the quality aspect in how the model actually predicted true positives in a significant amount. Thus, higher precision results in lower false positive rates.  Recall -> it focuses more on the quantity of positive INSTANCES (both false and true positives are included) that were identified by the model. Thus, higher recall results in lower false negative rates.",True

@pmcate2,2020-11-11T15:46:06Z,8,"This video is terrible. First of all, accuracy has a particular definition, so recall and performance are not a way of measuring accuracy because they have different definitions. Second, they way they present recall is just the precision of the other class which is not correct.",True

@WhompingWalrus,2019-11-15T02:58:10Z,9,"1:27 Why is it so satisfying to hear someone in a pretty professional context use the term ""sucks"" in this context?  It's not profanity, but it's usually avoided - & the fact that it wasn't avoided here is really refreshing for some reason.",True
