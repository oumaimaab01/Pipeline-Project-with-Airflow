@kagayakuangel5828,2023-02-13T03:39:01Z,0,"I just wanna say that this time series forecasting uses inductive reasoning which is NOT always correct. Inductive reasoning will not always yield truthful results.   For instance: Just because it rained yesterday doesn't mean it will rain today. Just because it was sunny today doesn't mean it will be sunny tomorrow.  However, if A is the union of B and C and D is the union of E and F...and B=E and C=F then by transitivity, A=D.  ^That is deductive.  With the principle of mathematical induction you can prove certain things to be true inductively, however certain requirements must be upheld in order to use this proof method.   Furthermore, there are many, many times when deductive reasoning is a more effective way of determining the surety of an occurrence than inductive reasoning.    It depends on the context entirely.",True
