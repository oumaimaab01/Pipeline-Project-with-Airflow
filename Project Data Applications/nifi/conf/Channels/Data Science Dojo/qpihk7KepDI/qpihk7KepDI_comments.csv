@wendhynovizar3926,2023-07-09T14:51:37Z,1,"Unfortunaely I have missing values object on this chunk:  titanic.model <- randomForest(formula = survived.formula, data = titanic.train, ntree = 500, mtry = 3, nodesize = 0.01 * nrow(titanic.test)) Can someone help",True
@talha-ccc1453ccc,2023-01-25T20:22:00Z,1,just wow. Salutation. I studied political science and I already did some modeling but this is next level stuff. Thank you for the insights man. But it suprised me you didnt even to bother checking Rsquared getting the best model but still your way ahead from what Ive ever seen. Again thx man,True
@dai786,2022-05-23T06:19:10Z,0,"Thanks, is there any details video about actual  randomeForest  part going from @17.27 ?  I can not understand how we able to attach  Survived to original Test,  without messing  rowIDs ?  Is that done by  <as.data.frame> somehow internally ? 60 Survived <-Predict(Titanic.Model, titanic.test)           ## output   rowId and Survived             > str(Survived )             Factor w/ 2 levels ""0"",""1"": 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 ...             - attr(*, ""names"")= chr [1:418] ""1"" ""2"" ""3"" ""4"" ...   62  PassengerId<- test$PassengerId 63  output.df <- as.data.frame(PassengerId) 64  output.df$Survived <- Survived         ### how R knows to attach prediction to the correct matching Row ????",True
@syhusada1130,2022-03-30T04:35:25Z,0,"You're predicting 1 unit of Fare, with 246 unit of Age still missing. (246 out of 263 missing existed in the filtered from the upper whisker version of the dataframe).   Is this alright?",True

@akashprabhakar6353,2020-07-25T18:31:27Z,0,"Thanks for the video sir... I tried applying logistic regression with following code:  survived.equation2 <- ""Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Embarked + Parch + Cabin + Fare  ""  survived.formula2 <- as.formula(survived.equation2) titanic.model2 <- glm( survived.formula2, data = titanic.train, family = ""binomial"") summary(titanic.model2)   Survived2 <- predict(titanic.model2, titanic.test,type = ""response"")  But its showing error:  Survived2 <- predict(titanic.model2, titanic.test,type = ""response"") Error in model.frame.default(Terms, newdata, na.action = na.action, xlev = object$xlevels) :    factor Cabin has new levels A11, A18, A21, A29, A9, B10, B11, B24, B26, B36, B45, B52 B54 B56, B61, C105, C116, C130, C132, C28, C31, C39, C51, C53, C55 C57, C6, C80, C89, C97, D22, D34, D38, D40, D43, E39 E41, E45, E52, E60, F, F E46, F E57  Can anyone help how to rectify this?",True

@OpeItsJoey,2020-02-04T05:02:49Z,3,Man you've got to make the text smaller and enlarge your window so I can actually see what's going on... Otherwise a handy video,True
@oscaryiu3329,2019-04-18T03:48:48Z,0,Will it a problem if the filter do not remove the row which haves NA value in Fare? Since i want to do a regression model to predict age but it is too many NA in the filter,True
