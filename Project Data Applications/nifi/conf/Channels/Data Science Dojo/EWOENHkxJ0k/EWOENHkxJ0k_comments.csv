Yes, we know that Joe is the only person that matches this code, but that's knowledge we shouldn't know and rely on. After all, in some other source list of names, there may be an item with the value ""Joe Biden"", which means that, based on the original code, the resulting array would contain a ""Joe"" item!!!",True
