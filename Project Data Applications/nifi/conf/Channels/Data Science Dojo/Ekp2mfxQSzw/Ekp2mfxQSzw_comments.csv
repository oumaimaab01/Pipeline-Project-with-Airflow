@theboats2596,2018-11-11T14:36:33Z,3,people don't seem to know but R is more powerful with respect to analytics than python.

But 95% of the time I use VBA along with SQL Server and Access. Fortunately I can do good stuff using VBA/Excel and thinking out of the box and it's really fast. But as long as I do not master any other language to work with data science, I feel that I'm still missing something. I didn't know that R was biuld from the scratch to be a data science language and that make me consider to learn it. I'm gonna watch your other videos on this channel. Do you have any other R courses available?",True
