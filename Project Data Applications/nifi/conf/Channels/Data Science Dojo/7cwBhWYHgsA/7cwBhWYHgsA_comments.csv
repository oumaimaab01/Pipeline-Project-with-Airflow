@nssSmooge,2018-11-16T17:00:19Z,0,"Hello, great videos to learn from. If I may, I have few questions/requests. I have a corpus of annual speeches given by several actors [kaggle datasets: UN General assembly statements] and I want to find the similarity of several countries to China for each year. So I went ahead and did cosine similarity on TF-IDF matrixes [code is in the link]. I am just not sure if I have to create vocabulary [tf-idf matrix from all speeches I wanna work with - find similarities] or I can just create individual tf-idf matrix from annual speeches from ONLY ONE ACTOR and compare it to another tf-idf matrix from another actor where the individual matrixes were created separated. Meaning I did not use tf-idf function on the corpus of all countries and then pulled an invidual country out, but first pulled individual country out and then used td-idf function to create a matrix.

@WorldAroundWe,2018-11-07T12:15:34Z,0,"Hi Dave, your videos are very helpful. I have one question - if i have a big matrix of 300 features and 3000 rows - how should i calculate the cosine similarity in that case",True
@AR3M3NTA,2018-09-19T03:05:44Z,3,"Hi Dave, great videos! I just wanted to bring to your attention that I think the file uploaded on the git repository for rf.cv.3 is incorrect. When I plot it with varImpPlot, it does not show the SpamSimilarity feature, and when I do the confusionMatrix fnct. I do not get the same values as you do.",True
@Nicole-se7zj,2018-04-12T06:39:48Z,2,Great explanation on the cosine similarity! Just what I need. Thanks!,True
@terrimoore613,2018-02-04T13:27:43Z,0,"Great videos, am currently on the 10th one.  Question:  How do we get the confusion matrices for the decision trees (part.cv.1, .. rpart.cv.3)?  That was not shown, or I missed it,  and I am not able to figure it out.  Also, how do you identify how the model performs on the test sets that were created initially?  Is this something that will be reviewed later?  Thanks, again, great videos!!!",True
@toastersman217,2018-01-27T22:57:36Z,1,"I did exactly like in this video. However, my rf.cv.3 object is different. My confusion matrix is different and the variables importance plot two. My results are not as good and the plot does not show the similarity feature.",True
@TomerBenDavid,2018-01-22T20:24:00Z,0,Amazing work.  When you convert from dataframe to as.matrix does this means the output data is all stored in memory? so we loose the dataframe distributeness? (i wonder then how to process it on real world situations when i cannot have the inmem luxury).,True
@fayburns0,2017-11-26T10:58:20Z,0,Great stuff Thank you very much for all the previous part as well :-),True

@TheShekhar91,2017-08-11T09:06:37Z,1,"Hey @Dave ,I wanted to know how many videos in this series are left. I'll start with a project of my own right after this then.  Thanks, Shekhar",True
@ChuckChekuri,2017-08-09T14:12:14Z,2,"Just finished watching all the 10 Videos. Very well produced. Sufficient details, Right Explanation, Nicely structured content.  Keep it up. Have been part of data science central now, I am going to follow data science mojo too.",True
