@gayathri.nagarajan,2020-10-14T15:02:36Z,0,"Hi Dave, Iam practicing the tfidf function of quanteda on train.tokens.tfidfg <- dfm_tfidf(train.tokens.dfm). This will cover the separate application of TF and IDF.But the values I get are different from what you get by applying them separately Eg: values you are getting is ok -0.2153 (text1), 0 (text 2). Whereas Iam getting ok-2.988559(text 1), 0 (text2).what is the correct understanding ?",True

@chrisdemchalk3491,2018-09-14T11:27:37Z,0,Great video series!  Question- why retain unique unigram after creating the  n-gram?  I am using gensim on the python side and it keeps only the then assembled ngram.  Let me know if i am theoretically losing detail. Thanks,True
@AR3M3NTA,2018-09-10T04:47:59Z,0,"Thank you so much for your help, your tutorials are extremely helpful. However, I am confused as to what you mean when you talk about preserving the idf vector. Why is this one so important to preserve as opposed to the tf vector or the tfidf vector? You say that it is important to use it to translate the new data into the space that the old data is in; but wouldn't the idf vector change itself once we starting adding new data in? Won't the contents change as we get more data? Why does the contents of this vector remain constant as we get new data in? Thank you in advance!",True

@TheShekhar91,2017-08-05T14:16:21Z,1,"Hi @Dave  I completely understood all that is happening in video #6, but when I try to train the model using  ""train.tokens.tfidf.df "" as data, I get the following error :    rpart.cv.2 <- train(Label ~ ., data = train.tokens.tfidf.df, method = ""rpart"",                      trControl = cv.cntrl, tuneLength = 7)   Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'Label' not found  I even looked it up on stack overflow and then used the GitHub repository for this piece of code and then eventually the whole code , just in case I was typing something wrong, but this error won't go.  Funny thing is the train.tokens.tfidf.df has a column named Label, and yet this error appears. Also this code works very well on rpart.cv.1  This same error persists for all the subsequent rpart.cv variables, i.e. rpart.cv.3, rpart.cv.4  Finally, this same  code sometimes  also throws an error : Error: protect(): protection stack overflow in R, (maybe due to 29K +  columns in the data set)  I'm stuck on this for a while now, and honestly this has become a roadblock in my learning. I have been waiting for your response on this , and would really appreciate your help.  Thanks, Shekhar",True

@Jayl__,2017-07-16T21:42:54Z,1,Thank you! This is really great! I love how you explain why each step of the process is done instead of just instructing us to do this. Really helpful for a project I'm working on text analytics. Can you finish off the tutorial to apply the model by predicting a test set in a sorta confusion matrix format? I'm not sure how to apply that model function in a random test sample. My project is due this tuesday!,True
