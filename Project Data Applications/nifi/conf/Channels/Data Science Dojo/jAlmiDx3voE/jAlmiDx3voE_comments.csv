I'm dealing with this question and stuck creating two joins - because the instructor never thought us how to do it but asked as to do it. Would you please give me some ideas on how I can deal with this? The questions is:  Q: Note that the Flight Delays Data dataset includes the following columns:  OriginAirportID DestAirportID These are numeric identifiers for the origin airport and destination airport for each flight.  To see the details of the airports, add the Airport Codes Dataset sample dataset to the experiment, and join it to the Flight Delays Data dataset. You will need to create two joins; one to join the origin airport and one to join the destination airport. You can use built-in Azure Machine Learning Join Data modules to accomplish this, or you could use custom SQL, R, or Python code. The resulting joined dataset should contain the original flight data as well as the name, city, and state for both the origin and destination airports.  I was able to add and connect Airport Codes Dataset to Flight Delays Data dataset creating one Join Data even though it is asking for creating two Joins. When I tried to create two joins, it gave me error messages. I spent close to 2 hours in solving this issues. Please help!!!",True
@anilskp,2015-05-22T05:58:39Z,1,"Well explained. When I tried Azure ML , in my screen the visualizations are appearing on right side of the data set instead on the top of the screen like in your video. Any release change?  I feel one on the top is more easy to work and view than on the side we need to scroll a lot in this..  Is it configurable?",True
