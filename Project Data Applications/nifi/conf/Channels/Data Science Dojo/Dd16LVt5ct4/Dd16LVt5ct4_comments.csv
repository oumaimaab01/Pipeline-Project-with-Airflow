@leemageorge4687,2022-03-15T07:12:46Z,0,similarity measure always lies between 0 and 1 ? what about Euclidean distance ?,True
@nukulkhadse5253,2021-08-19T14:04:15Z,2,This is the key to Similarity Based Modeling (SBM) and Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET) used for Anomaly Detection.,True
@darrrenmk,2021-06-22T23:28:41Z,4,"Hey I'm coming here from outside of this course because I wanted to understand the difference between these two measures. I'm wondering what a ""document vector"" is? Thanks!",True
@rembautimes8808,2021-01-27T20:22:24Z,0,Very good explanation on concepts,True
@usama57926,2020-08-09T13:00:10Z,1,Can we get the slides?,True
@crapscrapentertainment-pow7898,2020-06-08T18:44:03Z,0,"thanks, very helpful :)",True
@KingImmortal,2019-12-11T19:05:16Z,3,Does anyone know what the numbers on each d1 and d2 represent? Is it the amount of words per document? (For cosine similarity),True
@DinoKova8,2019-12-05T11:37:25Z,3,"Nice work, im now ready for my computer liguistics exam!",True
@scienceblossom6197,2019-05-27T13:56:57Z,5,Why does cosine similarity work? What's the logic/intuition behind it?,True
@b.ambrozio,2019-05-18T17:47:35Z,2,"Sorry, I'm trying to understand how did you arrive on .3150 at the Cosine Similarity. You said: ""so we multiply those two together (magnitudes) and divide 5 by that"". I've tried the formula you stated dot product of d1 and d2 divided by magnitudes: 5 / (6481 * 2245) = 3.436462...  Also in the first part, I didn't understand how did you calculate the distances. Is it Pythagoras theorem?",True
@shammerHammer,2019-02-12T17:44:24Z,0,cosine similarity gives you a number between -1 and 1 (you said 0 to 1 at ~ 4:00).,True
@ayush612,2019-01-19T16:01:51Z,3,Wow perfect!! Thanks sir for this tutorial !,True
@Ghegyi8,2016-11-16T21:39:28Z,29,Sqrt(6) = 2.449 for anyone wondering about the example given on the Cosine Similarity slide.,True
