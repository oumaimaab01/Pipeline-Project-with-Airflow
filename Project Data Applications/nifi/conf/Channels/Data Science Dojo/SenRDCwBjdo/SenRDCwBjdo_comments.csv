@borjcatingub,2017-03-06T19:03:22Z,0,"Guys, the video is too long for non-tech audience who is just starting out. Cut the video into sections that were discussed, put them into a playlist and allow people to consume each part separately.  Great Content, Keep Going :D",True
@avikamath9676,2017-01-14T09:11:09Z,2,"Great  video. To answer that dude's question, we rely on t-distributions and not on z-tables because in most practical cases the sigma is unknown. If we do know sigma, and the sample size is greater than 30, then by invoking central limit theorem, we can go with z-tables.",True
