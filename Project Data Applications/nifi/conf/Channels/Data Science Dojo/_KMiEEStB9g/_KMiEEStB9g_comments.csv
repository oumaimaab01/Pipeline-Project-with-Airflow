@DaveOnData,2017-01-20T21:17:23Z,7,"Greetings All!  Just wanted to let folks know about some errata in the video. Around 48:41 in the video an astute member of the audience pointed out that the scale of the plot of Case counts over time did not match the console output of totals over time. In the video I failed to uncover the root of the problem and jest (erroneously) regarding a potential bug in ggplot2. The actual source of the discrepancy was a bug in the code that output Event counts instead of Case counts. The corrected code is available via the GitHub.  Apologies,  Dave",True
