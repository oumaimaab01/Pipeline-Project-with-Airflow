@marvinbcn2,2022-02-23T20:09:08Z,0,"Great video as usual. There's only one sentence that annoys me at 4:19: ""The likelihood of p=0,57 given that 4 out of 7 people would randomly prefer Orange Fanta is greater than 0.273, the likelihood when p = 0.5"". The sentence seems self-contradictory to me, as p=0,57 is not compatible with random preference (or, using the contrapositive: random preference always implies p = 0,5). P ≠ 0,5 is equivalent to say that preferences are not random. So the  term ""randomly"" should be ruled out in this sentence. Does my observation make sense?",True

@Han-ve8uh,2021-05-21T05:11:55Z,0,"At 2:20, when swapping sides of variables why did only p change sides? I was expecting both n and p to change sides.  Since in the other video ""StatQuest: Probability vs Likelihood"" both mean and variance changed from right side to left side, and both mean and variance are parameters of the normal distribution. So i brought that analogy here, thinking both n and p are parameters of the binomial distribution, so i must move both n and p to the left?",True

@philippenachtergal6077,2020-11-17T10:45:22Z,0,"Hello guys,  what is the best way to compute say the 90% likelihood margin for this real world problem: We have a double blind vaccine test: * 12280 people got a placebo, 90 of them contracted the virus. * 12280 got the vaccine, 5 of them contracted the virus. So we have an efficiency at around 94,5%  How do you compute the error margin around that for a say 90% likelihood ? Do you compute separate margins for the placebo group and for the vaccine group and then divine the lower bound of the margin of the vaccine group by the higher bound of the margin of the other group and vice-versa to get a global margin or is there something more appropriate ?  Side note: I didn't compute it (yet) because excel can't handle things like binomials with a bas like 12280 very well and I don't really have the time to do it more properly.",True

@turtlepedia5149,2020-10-14T11:50:49Z,0,Sir in a normal distribution what does the y value suggest for a particular x?? Does that means for that value of x probability is the corresponding y value?? But does that even makes any sense if its continuous?? As in continuous distribution prob for certain value of x is zero,True
@turtlepedia5149,2020-10-14T11:29:53Z,0,Sir why didn't you did product for all xi's.. You just took log of the distribution and derived it that's not the likelihood function.... Like in other videos of yours like mle for poisson you said likelihood function is product of prob for all xis  https://youtu.be/1L6tQuG0K-M sir plz check this video..

@RaviShankar-jm1qw,2020-05-16T14:49:24Z,0,Hi Josh! I know this may sound quite naive - But I fail to understand why do we need likelihood in the first place - i understand that it is used when you have x and want to find out the parameters which can be used to find the exact probability distribution - but i cant seem to comprehend the intuition behind likelihood.
