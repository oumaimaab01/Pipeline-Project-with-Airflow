@statquest,2021-07-20T21:15:48Z,110,"NOTE: A lot of people ask ""What happens when the original collection of measurements is not representative of the underlying distribution?"" It's important to remember that a confidence interval is not guaranteed to overlap the true, population mean. A 95% CI means that if we make a ton of CIs using the same method, 95% of them will overlap the true mean. This tells us that 5% of the time we'll be off. So yes, a sample that is totally bonkers is possible, but rare. Understanding this risk of making the wrong decision, and managing it, is what statistics is all about. Also, at 5:55 I say there are up to 8^8 combinations of observed values and possible means, but this assumes that order matters, and it doesn't. So 8^8 over counts the total number of useful combinations and the true number is 15 choose 8, which is 6435 (for details on this math, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset#Counting_multisets )  Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/",True

@jgray2718,2022-03-12T23:25:11Z,0,"So I know bootstrapping is a well-respected and useful technique, but I have never been able to shake the feeling that repeated sampling from a sample doesn't really tell you anything, and that it should be relatively easy to calculate the actual bootstrapped sampling distribution rather than just making an approximation of it; I get that nobody's actually using this on a sample of size 8, but is there really no calculation we can just do?  If I'm sampling with replacement my population size is effectively infinite, but consists only of a few discrete values.  If I'm calculating the sample mean each time, why does the CLT not apply?  Assuming a large enough sample and/or a normal enough original sample distribution, don't we know not only what the mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped distribution will be, but also the bootstrapped sampling distribution itself?  It's also not clear to me why the bootstrapped distribution should tell you more about the population distribution than the original sample would, since the bootstrapped distribution is derived entirely from the sample.  Just in terms of what information can be gleaned from using the same numbers over and over it seems like you can't really be adding any new knowledge by sort of artificially repeating a sample, but without adding any actual new data.  Yes, if the sample is representative of the population you'll get something that looks like repeated samples, but if it's not, you won't.  And if it's in any way imperfectly representative of the population distribution, won't that imperfection be magnified by taking thousands of biased samples and pretending they're unbiased?  I mean, it's true that random sampling is unbiased over a large number of samples _from the population_ but any given sample is almost certainly biased at least a little bit, so using a single sample over and over should produce biased results, shouldn't it?  Anyway, I know the math behind bootstrapping exists, but I've never looked for it, so I'm sure this is fine.  It just feels very, I don't know, incestuous?",True

@statquest,2021-07-20T21:15:48Z,110,"NOTE: A lot of people ask ""What happens when the original collection of measurements is not representative of the underlying distribution?"" It's important to remember that a confidence interval is not guaranteed to overlap the true, population mean. A 95% CI means that if we make a ton of CIs using the same method, 95% of them will overlap the true mean. This tells us that 5% of the time we'll be off. So yes, a sample that is totally bonkers is possible, but rare. Understanding this risk of making the wrong decision, and managing it, is what statistics is all about. Also, at 5:55 I say there are up to 8^8 combinations of observed values and possible means, but this assumes that order matters, and it doesn't. So 8^8 over counts the total number of useful combinations and the true number is 15 choose 8, which is 6435 (for details on this math, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset#Counting_multisets )  Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/",True

@darnelb1912,2021-07-06T15:07:13Z,2,Great video! I learn so much with you!,True
@nautical1078,2021-07-06T14:49:21Z,17,"Thanks for the videos, embarrassingly I'm relearning a lot of these concepts even though I graduated with a Statistics major. It's coming a lot easier now.",True
@rattaponinsawangwong5482,2021-07-06T14:39:26Z,0,I‚Äôm not sure if you already have videos about permutations and test statistics?,True
@moart87,2021-07-06T12:32:39Z,2,"Damn Josh. I‚Äôm 33 and still don‚Äôt have any children. But when I inevitably will, I‚Äôm showing them (or I‚Äôll recreate the explanations) these vids at a young age to educate them. Econometrics will be a breeze that way!",True
@ControlTheGuh,2021-07-06T11:55:17Z,0,Isn't this a kind of monte carlo simulation?,True
@NTesla00,2021-07-06T11:11:58Z,109,"Passed all my stats courses already (thanks to your videos for a major part), but I'm still watching these as they come out, lol. Keep it up Josh, this channel is so good.",True
@petercourt,2021-07-06T10:49:50Z,6,"Awesome work! Thanks Josh! It seems weird to me that this creates useful/meaningful results. You're just reusing the same data again and again, so even though we can generate new means by bootstrapping, are those means actually correct? In other words, has anyone compared bootstrapping (and calculating the mean) to repeating the experiment a bunch of times (and calculating the mean)?",True
@estevaodias6404,2021-07-06T10:27:42Z,1,Awesome! The proofs about it seems to be nice,True
@travelthetropics6190,2021-07-06T08:41:40Z,6,Wow! this is the first time I learned this. awesome!,True
@VictorBanerjeeF,2021-07-06T07:16:33Z,1,Super BAM,True
@quorrexnoway9127,2021-07-06T06:51:28Z,36,This kinda feels illegal xD Really nice explained!,True

@kangtaw,2021-07-06T06:12:58Z,1,"Oh noooo, the Lord of BAMS is here üôå",True
@RoRight,2021-07-06T05:44:18Z,4,BAMM! It will be great if you can compare and contrast cross-validation and bootstrapping for us.,True
@KillerFridge,2021-07-06T05:41:06Z,29,"I love SQ, because I finally ""get"" bootstrapping, despite having used it for years!",True
@gz6616,2021-07-06T04:48:56Z,3,"Hi Josh, I'm having some trouble understanding the ""factor analysis"" algorithm, to me it seems to be a PCA decomposition but without the orthogonality constraints, but I'm really not sure I got it correct or not. Could you make a video on that?",True
@DrSirmacek,2021-07-06T04:37:43Z,3,That is how vaccine effectiveness is computed.,True

@EngRiadAlmadani,2021-07-06T04:17:47Z,0,Great work bammm!!!! But is it the same bootstraping that used to learn deep Q network in rainforsement learning,True
@punditgi,2021-07-06T04:13:54Z,4,Very clear explanation. Well done!,True
@jaundersousa3530,2021-07-06T04:13:47Z,2,A professor at the university I studied at was apparently a key contributor to Bootstrapping. Excellent job at explaining it in such an easy-to-understand way!,True
