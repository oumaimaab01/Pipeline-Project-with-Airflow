@SergeySenigov,2023-09-24T13:14:29Z,0,Hi Josh! Do you have a video about difference practical vs. statistical significance?,True
@anlinli6463,2023-06-20T04:18:49Z,0,"Thanks a lotttttt Josh! I love the part that you explain a little bit higher P value is OK in certain situations. One more question! Let's say if I got a gene with significant P value but marginally insignificant FDR value in the exploration stage (e.g., a correlation analysis using spearman),  and then I moved forward to do other analyses (not the same analysis) and found out this gene actually is very important. Is that acceptable that my previous FDR value is not perfect? Or can I explain ""this insignificant FDR value"" by saying that just because the sample size is not enough? I watched your other vedios about p-hacking, but I am not sured wheather my situation belong to it. Thanks so much Josh. I appreciate a lot your help!",True

@taotaotan5671,2021-04-06T00:25:51Z,0,"Hi Josh. I am not sure if ""5% of the time you are wrong"" is an appropriate statement about p-value (1:27).  P-value means the probability of the observed events or more extreme events, given the null hypothesis, and it's not the same as the probability of making a mistake. In fact, depending on the prior plausibility of the hypothesis, p = 0.05 could result in ~30% error rate of rejecting the null.",True
@shwetasingh2389,2021-03-05T03:40:55Z,1,The probability of me concentrating while watching you is = 0.01 and that is less than  <0.05. Therefore you are really attractive so please do mercy don't come in front of the camera when you discuss something it is very hard to concentrate,True

It should be mandatory for all of the published papers, particularly for those in medical/ biological sciences. Is can prevent the deleterious consequences of p-hacking.",True

@miguelalmeida4802,2018-11-04T17:09:49Z,4,"Hi Josh - quick question: what is the link (which I probably missed) between  a p value being a measure of how usual the observation is ie p value of a coin toss is 1 = very usual; to then using low p values ie 0.05 and saying that my Ho is only wrong 5% of the times. It is just the phrasing of it that throws me off but surely according to the first statement a low p value would mean - this observation is so extreme it cannot possibly be correct. Mind you, I have actually covered this as an undergrad and was hoping this would sink in correctly once an for all; hence I am watching your videos - which are totally underrated. Congratulations on the project - hugely benefitial to all. Best, M",True
