@Cuicui229,2021-06-10T16:52:08Z,0,Hi thanks for the video! I want to ask whether the scale must be used in dist function? What is the reason for doing this? THANKS!,True

@ottomorris463,2020-05-03T00:36:20Z,0,"Fantastic video! However, I'm little confused with the link to limma/edgeR's plotMDS function. This does not compute eigen values. Is it appropriate to put eigen values on such a plot?",True
@aligh18,2020-04-22T20:08:30Z,0,Is PCoA okay to be used on a gower distance matrix? Great video by the way!,True

@momo-do3hj,2019-07-03T20:46:31Z,0,"Hi thanks for all your videos they're very helpful. I was following along with my data up until about 5:50 in the video - where you create an empty matrix (check - got this), and then take the mean absolute value - this is where things got weird for my data. Instead of displaying the new values I was returned 0's, NaNs, and Inf...I'm wondering why this may be? Is there another way to do this calculation?",True
@KensterInSilico,2019-04-13T00:53:04Z,1,I've been working on trying to plot a PCoA for one of my projects for a while now. I got it to work after watching your video. Thanks very much!!!,True
@emilypadhi8382,2019-04-03T15:57:40Z,0,"Thanks for this video! There is an error in your code early in this video.   You wrote:  colnames(data.matrix) <- c(   + paste(""wt"", 1:5, sep = """"),  + paste(""ko"", 1:5, sep = """"))  It should be:  colnames(data.matrix) <- c(      paste(""wt"", 1:5, sep = """"),       paste(""ko"", 1:5, sep = """"))  I couldn't get your code to work as written. Maybe we are using different versions of R? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",True
