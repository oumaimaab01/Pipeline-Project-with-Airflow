What is the best would you would evaluate the algorithm (silluete score,...) to decide which clustering method and distance to use ( i undestand that silluete score is good to choose the number of k but not to decide between algorithms)?  To decide the best algorithm i have been ploting PCA and color label by clusters created this way understanding if the clusters make sense or not?

In the case that the data is binary, (e.g instead of expression data, genomic alteration data) what kind of distance would you use?   Best Regards, Manuel",True
