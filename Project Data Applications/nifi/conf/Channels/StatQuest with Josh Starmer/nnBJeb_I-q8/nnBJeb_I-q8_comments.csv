@the_sunlit,2022-09-18T23:51:44Z,1,"1:45 -  Just for myself —  it's Parametric vs. Non-Parametric !  See the differences & assumptions of ""parametric"" tests here:  https://youtu.be/biXY84hDX5M  tl;dr -  Non-parametric tests are recommended as it's more conservative, having less assumptions about the parameters + variance",True
@dieterzucker72,2022-05-13T10:12:04Z,0,"Josh, first I want to say thank you for you great work! Your videos really help me getting into stats but I have some problems adepting your examples from genetics to problems in the social sciences. Say I have a list of countries and measure their democracy scores on two scales and want to compare them (as done in severals papers). So I would use a paired t-test because they are not splitted into groups but on the other hand how does this fit into your example with a test before and after a drug?",True

@agirmaus-lh9zi,2022-03-20T20:55:07Z,1,you are awesome !,True
@slnmoorthy9293,2022-03-20T16:25:20Z,0,Hey Josh! The way you explained about the t test concept is awesome but one thing that concerns me about your other videos is it is not as conversational or natural as this video and I really appreciate you try to explain the concepts as lucid you want to be but those anime gets mundane. If you don't mind it would be great if you could explain the concepts the way you did for t test. But please don't stop posting videos about these concepts I have been following you and really thank you for your work.,True

@andreahategan1061,2021-11-05T15:07:37Z,0,"Thank you for the great explanation on when to use paired t-test and when to use independent t-test. I think it is clear that if I have two samples for the same subjects/users before and after an intervention I should perform a paired sample t-test and if I have two independent samples (completely different subjects/users) I should do a two-sample independent t-test. But if I can collect both a paired sample and an independent sample is there any recommendation on what is the best practice to decide if I need to collect a paired sample or two independent samples in order to decide if an intervention has any effect or not? For example, we release a feature that we assume it will increase user happiness (as measured by several metrics). In order to assess if the users are happier with the new feature (as measured by difference in the selected metrics), should we collect data from the same user before the release and after the feature is released and perform a paired t-test OR collect data from the same release in which half the users have the feature turned on and half of them have the feature turned off and perform a two-sample independent t-test? So, the question is for which type of problems should we aim to collect paired samples and for which to collect independent samples? Is there any danger that they will lead to wrong conclusions if we don’t collect the correct type of samples?",True

@v.dineshkumar2562,2021-05-20T19:07:17Z,3,"Another great video of yours. I have been struggling with this concept for quite sometime and I always mess it up. ""LET THE DATA SPEAK"" for itself should be the tag line I guess.  Thanks Sir for creating such great content.  I guess you should do more video with your video on. It gives us a chance to view the creator and appreciate his effort.   Great work!!! Please keep bringing it on.",True
@valentinakurenshchikova8118,2021-03-17T08:02:26Z,0,"Josh, your videos are brilliant, thank you so much! I have a question though. So I have a dataset with 2 groups of cities and their annual crime rate from 1975 to 2015. I want to figure if the crime rate in group 1 is statistically different from that in group two (doing it with R if that matters). Am I correct to say that I need to use unpaired two-tailed t-test and use the means of crime rates in group 1 and group 2 as the 2 arguments of the function? Thank you so very much!",True

@av3499,2020-07-18T03:30:48Z,0,"I don't get the point behind 'equal variance' t-test. If there are 2 groups of data, and they have different means - that can only be because of 2 reasons: 1. they belong to different distributions (great!) 2. they belong to same distribution but the 2nd group has outliers, which causes mean to shift. If the 2nd group has outliers, then obviously the variance is going to be much higher/lower than 1st.  So, if we rule out outlier option 2 as a pre-condition i.e. both  groups have same variance (no outliers), and they have different means, then must come from different distributions.. so why do we need a t-test to tell us that ?",True

@joaoostrowski,2019-04-27T11:32:48Z,25,"I appreciate so much the work you're doing in YouTube Josh. I always thought that when deciding about one or two-tail tests we should first look at the designed alternative hypothesis (when different than 0 it implies two-tail for example). However, your idea of ""leaving the data to speak for itself"" in order to be more conservative prooving rock solid data is outstanding. Again, thank you so much for your dedication, I'm connecting with you on LinkedIn to hopefully learn more from you and your team. Cheers from an engineer working with Data Science in Hungary.",True
