@AmarLakel,2020-03-05T13:45:47Z,1,"Hi Josh,   For the prediction of epidemics I use the EpiModel package in R. Very simple and very clear. But beware prediction and epidemic is almost nonsense. A priori a viral phenomenon is easy to predict except that the evolution of the virus causes its environment to change completely. Reaction from health authorities, mutations of the virus, dissemination in areas that do not have the same characteristics as the spread progresses ... Triple Bamm !!!   But for fun see here the tutorial http://epimodel.org/tut.html",True
