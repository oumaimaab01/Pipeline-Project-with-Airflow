In my organization, we are building decision trees for nonlinear data using XGBOOST with python. I noticed after plotting the tree that out of 10 features or predictors, the tree uses only 5 predictors to build the tree. This is without tuning any parameters. So my question is in general what are the reasons for the tree not to include all features? My second question is: I often use the prediction contribution method from XGBOOST to calculate the prediction of each individual features. Could you therefore kindly make a video feature prediction contribution OR shapley values to clear this concept in near future? thank you!",True

@HardFault0x00,2021-04-11T16:02:57Z,0,"In the last section, the tree with multiple variable, after choosing age as the root of the tree you put dosage as next internal node in the right, I understand that it is because the RSS value is lower than sex, but why you put dosage >= 29 instead of 14.5 like in one variable tree? If it is because dosage >= 29 is the same first internal node as in the one variable tree (14.5 is the root) then basically we need to grow a full one variable tree for all predictors, because we don't know which one of the internal node in the particular one variable tree will be used in internal node of multi variable tree, it can be the last internal node or maybe the 3rd or 6th internal node.  or  it is because of another calculation, maybe like finding new dosage threshold by finding new lowest RSS value among all samples in dosage predictor but limited to samples that have age value < 50?  actually I have found your answer in the comments section, but you are only answering ""because this time the data have already been split based on age ...."", but I still don't get it, it is still doesn't clear to me, like if you are not growing one variable tree with dosage predictor before, you will not suddenly put dosage >= 29 in the internal node on right side, right?  then in other words either you need to growing the one variable tree first before growing multi variable tree or you are finding dosage threshold on-the-fly when you are growing multi variable tree",True

@jaredk4813,2020-06-22T23:42:31Z,2,"Great video. One suggestion that I have is in the first part of the video, where you're performing regression with a single predictor variable, you demonstrated that the SAME predictor variable can be used to form a binary partition multiple times. In the second half of the video, you did an example with multiple regression using multiple predictor variables. However, in this example, it appears that the partitioning uses each variable once. I believe that you can use the same variable to make multiple splits as you did in the single predictor variable case. This might be important to edit in -- I don't believe I heard a statement on this.",True
