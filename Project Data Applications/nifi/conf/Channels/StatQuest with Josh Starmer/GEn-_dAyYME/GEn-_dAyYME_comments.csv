@Retko85,2021-09-27T12:18:02Z,0,"Hi Josh.. I am a little confused, regarding features and samples . For example here on 6:56, you say that PCA create plots based on correlations among samples. Only concept of correlation that I know is between features, so when 2 features change together, correlation is big. But I got confused here. I tried to search about sample correlations, and what I found was correlations on samples, as part of a population, but here samples should be like rows/instances/observations. Also your computation of Euclidean distance got me confused, Since you have features as rows - gene1, gene2, and samples as columns, cell 1, cell 2. Can you please confirm my understanding - Does PCA create plot based on correlations among FEATURES, like, person age, weight etc., where each person is a sample?? Thank you :)",True

@Cuicui229,2021-06-10T17:20:13Z,0,"hi Josh! Thanks for the video! I still didn't get the point how we can do the same thing on the distance matrix as we do on PCA(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ&t=13s) I watched this video, and thanks for your wonderful explanation, I could imagine that for serveral samples with 2 genes, we can draw the dot on the 2-D plot(gene1 and gene2), and we find the best fit line, which is the PC1 and then a PC1 vertical line as PC2, both with the largest distance to the origin. But when it comes to the distance matrix, how can we draw the dot, because there is no gene. Only sample1, sample2 ...et al. I really confused. Truly thankful!",True

I'm a bit confused that when you said ""PCA starts by calculating the correlation among samples"", did you mean the plotting of each sample on multi-dimensions like your previous PCA video? If so, how about PCoA? Do we also ""plot"" the distances among samples first and then try to get the top 2 PCs as well? If that's true, then how is the number of dimensions determined in the case of PCoA? I watched all of your PCA videos and I can understand how to get a PCA, but somehow I still don't know how a PCoA is done... thank you!",True
