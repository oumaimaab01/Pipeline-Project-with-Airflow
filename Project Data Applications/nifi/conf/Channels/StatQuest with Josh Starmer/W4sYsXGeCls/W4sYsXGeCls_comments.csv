@haroldvelasquez2806,2024-01-24T16:06:29Z,0,"- Two different tensor views: One for mathematicians and physicists (not discussed). and the second in Neural Networks (we discuss this) - Even simple neural networks require lots of math (boring) - In practice images are 256x256 px times 3 channels = 196, 608 px. Consider a video! lol - From the view of neural networks. They store simple and complex values. Tensor may seem boring, just rename what exists.  	- if input is 1 value: scalar -> 0-dimensional tensor 	- if input is two values: array -> 1 dimensional tensor 	- if input is image : matrix -> 2 dimensional tensor 	- if input is video: multidimensional matrix or ndarray (python)  -> n-dimensional tensor - Tensors are designed for hardware acceleration. They speed up math. They are sped up with GPUs or TPUs (Tensor processing units) - Tensor handle back propagation easily with automatic differentiation",True
@dsagman,2023-02-28T20:52:35Z,2,"The poster is clear: it is Troll subscript 2. Which is a linearly independent sample from the data set of Troll. The use of superscript in the other poster is an alternative notation that should have used (2) instead of 2, but the LaTex got scrambled via a cross-entropy loss function error in the encoder training.",True
