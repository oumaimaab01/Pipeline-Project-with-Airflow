@tantzer6113,2022-11-02T00:24:34Z,0,"Question.  I was thinking whether we could have negative values for cosine similarity in NLP contexts.  At first sight, the answer may seem to be no, since word frequencies can only be positive (upper-right quadrant of the plane).  However, what if we replace word frequencies F(i,j) (frequency of word i in document j) with dF(i), defined as the deviation of the frequency from the mean frequency of word i?  This dF(i) can have positive and negative values.",True
@DrJohnnyStalker,2022-11-01T17:07:21Z,0,"Please be careful, with transformer embeddings words like ""bad"" and ""good"" gets similar embeddings because they Pop-up in similar spots. Cosine similarity on transformer embeddings will therefore not end up in a good sentiment classifier. Meaning ... Troll 2 is bad and Troll 2 is good will end up with high cosine similarity scores.",True
