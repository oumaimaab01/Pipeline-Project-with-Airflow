@giraldiego,2022-05-16T11:01:44Z,0,"1:33 On this slide, It seems like the reason we correctly reject the Null hypothesis it is because the p-value is less than 0.05, but based on what I have learnt from your previous videos, I think it is because the value was actually very small (0.0004). Am I wrong? Cuz, what we only can say if it is below 0.05, it is that you can reject the Null Hypothesis and you will do it 95% of the time, but you still can be wrong rejecting it.

@Happy.Traveller,2021-06-19T05:57:53Z,0,"How do you calculate the P value of something that isn't due to chance? I watched your video on calculating P values, the example was on coins. Tossing coins is purely by chance if the coin was fair. Since food and drug are not fair, they are rigged, ie, they have a purposeful effect, how do you calculate P value? What is the value for each step? You ""How to calculate p-values"" video listed 3 steps. What would be the value of step 1 and 2? Would you say ""What are the chances of the weight being specifically a value"" (say, 80.19 grams) or ""What are the chances of the weight being above or below a certain value""? Because if that is the case, it would be 50% since, when there is a clear difference between the 2, one entire group would be more than your set value, and the other will be less, as your graph demonstrates. Ie if 3 out of 6 are above a certain value (normal diet) and 3 out of 6 are under that value, it would be 3/6 which is 50%.  Then since the value can be set at anything, if I set it super low or super high so it includes all or neither of the two groups, such as ""chances of a mouse being less than 0 grams"" or ""more than 100kg"" then you can say 0 out of 6. How do you calculate the p value then?  As always: I hate statistics and statistics make no sense.",True
