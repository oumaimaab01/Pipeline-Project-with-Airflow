@nuclearcrow28,2023-11-10T19:21:40Z,0,"The meaning of the PCA plot is well explained, but there is one aspect that I find a bit odd about how the concept is approached...  At the beginning, we consider plots where the axes correspond to different data samples, and the points on the graph correspond to different features. This kind of plot is useful in its own right, as it allows to compare two or three data samples across all of their features and reason about their correlation.  HOWEVER, this kind of plot does not truly illustrate the issue that PCA solves. The problem with this kind of plot is that you cannot compare many data samples at once; but there is no problem with the amount of features - you can have as many as you want. PCA, however, solves a different problem - the problem of having too many features, rather than too many data samples. When you switch to the PCA plot, this is quickly noticeable - now the axes represent features (or rather linear combinations of features), and the points represent data samples.  This is not to say that the video is poorly structured - in fact it is structured really well. You present a certain problem that one can run into with data visualisation, and then you show a different approach that avoids the problem. All I'm saying is the following: The initial approach used to present the problem does not quite show the same problem that PCA solves. A better illustration of the problem would be the case where there are many cells regardless, but a varying amount of features. This can better bring across the meaning of ""dimensionality reduction"".",True

With regards to PCA , can I ask what's your opinion on using this tools for the purpose of detecting possible outliers? I've  recently being exploring tools such us PcaGrid for this assessment, considering other approaches such as the Cooks distance method might help detecting possible outliers for each gene being assessed. However, PCA has helped me, as an exploring data analysis tool, to get a visual assessment on how a particular gene contributes to the variation observed in the data set, and also which samples are most valuable for this subject. Do you think PCA can help and investigator to detect individual samples that behave differently not only with regards to the expression on one gene in particular but several being assessed for one purpose?

Amazing vid, but I have a question: if I have data that is weighted from 0-100 and is scattered on a 2d plane, could we use pca to compare the weight and distance to some generic hotspot point (so 2 ‚Äúgenes‚Äù for analogy) between all the nodes (cells)? Im worried that it would be too inprecise to be accurate (imagine 1 million points in a 1 by 1 square plot). additionally, lots of eyeballed clusters that I see overlap each other, so id need to separate these groups first if necessary. What would u recommend i do?: PCA or do u know any algorithm or set of algorithms that can first separate groups by weight and density and then cluster those groups (most of which, though not all, will just be groups consisting of one cluster) by density.

The few things I would mention that would be helpful are that PCA is really a measure of covariance in a sample and that PCA does NOT provide ANY indication of statistical significance.  Understanding Covariance is helpful to really understand PCA.  Also, PCA is particularly useful when patterns emerge between experimental and non-experimental parameters.  If patterns associated with experimental parameters are observed (i.e. treatment conditions) it indicates that there may be changes between samples/populations that are of interest; in cases where there are patterns associated with non-experimental parameters (such as collection date or incubation conditions) it indicates that the date of collection resulted in more variance than experimental parameters.  In such a case, it points to a possible flaw in experimental design so that it would be of benefit to re-evaluate sample collection/preparation/incubation etc... in the workflows to minimize the influence on the studied populations.",True

@adelutzaification,2017-12-04T22:27:48Z,0,"Is there any rationale for choosing one method of dimension reduction over another? Or is it just trial and error? I did pca and t-sne with the iris dataset and the cluster separation looks pretty similar by eye.  This is pretty remarkable as it seems that t-sne reduces everything to only 2 dimensions (as assessed by the number of Y columns in the t-sne _out list-from your example in the t-sne video). Does t-sne always reduce the number of dimensions to 2? I expected that PCA, which has more dimensions and therefore more ways to compare things, be more adept at cluster discrimination...",True
