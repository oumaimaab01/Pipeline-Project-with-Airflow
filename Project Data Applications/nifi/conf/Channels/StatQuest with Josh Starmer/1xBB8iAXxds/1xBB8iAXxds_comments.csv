@dihancheng952,2023-03-27T02:19:30Z,1,"The following summary of this video is generated using the openai whisper api, is it good?  The text discusses the latest trends in AI, and whether or not they are being overselled. Luca argues that while some people may be concerned that these techniques are leading to artificial intelligence that is too human-like, the reality is that they are simply providing more value than ever before. He cites the example of a person in HR who is using AI to help screen resumes, and notes that this is just one example of how AI is benefiting people in a direct way.,The text discusses the development of chatbots and how they are becoming more natural and fluent. It also mentions that there are many open source alternatives to the chatbot GPT3, which is based on scraped data.,The text describes a method for training a machine learning model to generate text. The first step is to pre-train the model by feeding it a large amount of text. The second step is to fine-tune the model by providing it with pairs of questions and answers. The model is then further improved by using reinforcement learning, which involves training the model to produce text that results in a positive outcome (reward).,The text describes how artificial agents can be trained to make decisions based on probabilities, in order to optimize their rewards. This technique can be used to control players in games, or to simulate processes that are difficult to express. The agents may sometimes take unusual decisions, in order to explore different options and find the best possible reward.,The text discusses how reinforcement learning can be used to fine-tune AI models, with a focus on how a reward model can be used to align the model with human expectations.,The text discusses the idea that it is now possible to create models that are much better aligned with human values, and that this could potentially lead to a future where AI is much better behaved.,The text discusses the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to be used for evil purposes. It notes that while AI models are becoming more sophisticated, they are still ultimately based on simple techniques that are reproducible and attainable.,The text describes how Lightning makes it possible to create applications that are easy to scale and that don't require a lot of platform engineers to maintain.",True
@Dagon47,2023-01-29T17:51:36Z,1,The reward model and PPO is quite nicely summarised. I would also add Geometric Deep Learning as one of the next future subjects which will be quite a big BAM,True

@tim40gabby25,2023-01-24T18:08:22Z,1,"Seriously important and timely conversation. Diagrams and pictures remain information dense but not accessible to chatGPT, for now. Safeguards remain at the core - DARPA may require different alignments, for example. Old UK duffer here, enjoying the  human chat.",True
