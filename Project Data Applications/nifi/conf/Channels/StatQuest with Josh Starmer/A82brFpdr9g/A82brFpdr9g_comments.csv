Every video I've watched has been unclear or just to complex for me to visualize and understand. I literally paused at 1:34 and just sat there for a solid minute cause it was that simple. I'm amazed that no one has ever explained it like this to me, including my Stats teacher. Thanks so much for this!",True

@JoseLopez-wj3sb,2019-12-22T19:04:47Z,1,Thanks! What I still don't understand is the difference between a single sample of 20 observations and 4 samples of 5 observations. Is there any gain (or loss) when categorizing the mice in 4 groups of 5 observations instead of considering the 20 observations as a single sample?,True
@rawan2675,2019-12-21T13:33:22Z,2,Finally I got it !!!  Thank you SO MUCH,True
@saygndiler5734,2019-12-18T20:46:28Z,1,you are awesome.......... finally ı got the point.,True
@magaretgrad8105,2019-12-10T14:22:30Z,0,"This video is worthless. I am looking for how to get sd from standard error and sample size, thats what i want to know. Explaining what they do and not telling how to calculate them is useless",True
@animals42life8,2019-11-30T02:07:58Z,0,"Say for example I have one set of measurements of temperature, 5 of them. Can I treat these individual observations as means already? That is, I can get the standard error even if I have only one set of measurement, I just think of them as means already. Is that valid?",True
@TheYellowshuttle,2019-11-20T20:52:13Z,4,Beautifully explained!,True
@rabbisheryl9613,2019-11-06T10:02:19Z,1,you are my hero,True

@ireneylhsiao,2019-09-30T01:13:04Z,5,I have seen lots of articles and videos explaining Standard Error using complicated terms and I couldn't get it. This is the only that make sense to me. Really clear and simple. Thanks a lot.,True

@prerakhere,2019-08-23T02:16:21Z,0,"Hello, i was wondering if you could guide me on how to calculate standard error from a single set of measurements (single observation). I watched statquest on standard error but i could not find it. Thanks.",True

@bhavyageethika4560,2019-07-10T06:44:05Z,2,crazy good,True
@ahmedal-ebrashy3691,2019-07-09T07:26:31Z,1,This was brilliant.,True
@liza10o,2019-06-16T12:00:55Z,0,but we're taught and I've also read it in various books like Wooldridge that standard error is the one we get for individual samples and the standard deviation is from the population(and hence we practically never know it's value). SE is said to be the statistic for SD. Is that wrong? What the video tells as SD is SE according to this definition from the books. and what the video tells as SE seems to be the root of variance calculated for normal distribution for Central Limit Theorem.,True

@flagshipbuilds,2018-10-27T09:20:23Z,5,"Thank you for the clear and simple explanation, as I am visual learner. I re-phrased it to my understanding/textbook. Please clarify/advise: Standard deviation quantifies how much a data entry deviates from the mean, within a data set.  Standard error quantifies the deviation of multiple means from the true mean, from multiple data sets.",True

@Skeptic_Awe,2018-09-15T23:23:32Z,5,"Thanks for this video. Great explanation! One question though. If there is only one set of measurements, then how can we calculate standard error? I feel that by definition (provided in the video) standard error is not applicable to one set of measurements. Any thoughts on this are greatly appreciated. Thanks!",True
@RedBullxMD,2018-08-15T00:15:43Z,148,I work in data science. Took masters level courses from many professors for a lot of $$. These videos are much clearer (and better) IMO,True
