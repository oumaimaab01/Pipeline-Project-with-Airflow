@statquest,2022-11-07T15:07:44Z,34,"To learn more about Lightning: https://lightning.ai/ Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/ NOTE: Since LSTM is a type of neural network, we find the best Weights and Biases using backpropagation, just like for any other neural network. For more details on how backpropagation works, see: https://youtu.be/IN2XmBhILt4 https://youtu.be/iyn2zdALii8 and https://youtu.be/GKZoOHXGcLo The only difference with LSTMs is that you have to unroll them for all of your data first and then calculate the derivatives. In the example in this video, that means unrolling the LSTM 4 times (as seen at 17:49) and calculate the derivatives for each variable, starting at the output, for each copy and then add them together. ALSO NOTE: A lot of people ask why the predictions the LSTM makes for days other than day 5 are bad. The reason is that in order to illustrate how, exactly, an LSTM works, I had to use a simple example, and this simple example only works if it is trained to predict day 5 and only day 5.",True

For company A, I noticed we a trend when we were trying to predict for day 5, we initialized the short and long term memory and then started plugging inputs which was values for previous days. In each timestamp we generated new short and long term memory, why were they inaccurate until day 5 when we wanted to predict and got the correct value from the output gate?",True

In those videos, you explained how we update weights by considering all inputs at once. Now, I understand that in CNNs, convolution helps manage the high number of inputs by reducing layers. That got me thinking about LSTMs. Given the potentially huge number of inputs in sequential data, how does the training process differ for LSTMs?

When completing the calculation of one unit to produce two steps at (t+1) you need not remember any information from step (t).  This seems pretty cool, since it gives the property that, if you have the short memory, the long memory, and the input, you could theoretically start anywhere in the sequence and get the same prediction at the end. Is this a property that is designed on purpose? Although I suppose you'd never know what the states of the LT and ST values were supposed to be and probably would initialize at 0.",True

Has been following your Neural Networks playlist quests these past weeks to reach Encoder Decoder part and as a complete beginner in the topic I love how it connect with each other!  I have several question regarding how LSTM use in prediction: 1. does LSTM can only predict on the last unit? Because seeing the example in 17:56, the only correct prediction is on the last unit (Day 4 to predict Day 5) while the others are not correct like the output from Day 1 to predict Day 2 is -0.1 while the observed value is around 0.5  2. What would happen if I want to predict Day 6? Do I have tune the weight for the whole previous Day 1-5 again? The reason I was thinking that is because seeing the example in 17:56, from my current understanding if we continue to Day 6 using the same unit with the same weight, it will give the same output as from Initial to predict Day 2 (same LTM, same STM, same Input)  3. From my current understanding, due to Tanh Activation function the New STM / Real Output would only range in (-1,1). What should we do if we want to train a model that predict outside this value? do we have to do some preprocessing like normalization?",True

@p-niddy,2023-06-18T09:11:37Z,0,"I don't understand *how* does using separate paths for long- and short-term memory avoid the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. This video describes *what* an LSTM is (and quite beautifully so, as usual), but I didn't completely understand how this system solves the original problem.  ChatGPT provides the following: By using these [forget, input, and output] gates, LSTMs can control the flow of information through time and selectively update or forget information as needed. This gating mechanism helps in avoiding the vanishing/exploding gradient problem *by allowing the network to decide when to retain or discard information based on the input and the previous hidden state*. The memory cell serves as a long-term memory component that can store information over long sequences, while the hidden state acts as a short-term memory component that allows the network to propagate information effectively through time.  Does this mean that what's basically happening is that the system is controlling whether to use the new long- or short-term value based on whether the gradient is too large or too small, or would be affected as such? And if so, what is the mechanism in this system that does that, exactly?",True

Doesn't this contradict the whole point of RNN and LSTM being able to handle differing quantities of sequential data?  What sort of dataset did you use to train this set of weights and biases, and was it trained using diffferent length datasets or always 4 days data predict day 5. for that matter, was it actually trained, or did you just calculate out some weights and biases that would work for this specific example and only this example for demonstrating the structure?",True

@alessandrovecchi5147,2023-01-28T10:45:15Z,0,"Thanks josh, great explanation. I'm now one step closer to understanding LSTM. I'm still plenty of questions, though.  In the first stage we obtain the percentage of long memory to retain. But in order to obtain this percentage, the only things that change from one iteration to the next are the input and the short term memory value. How can these two give us what percentage of the long-term memory retain? (I get it, the sigmoid maps every number to a percentage, the question is about how on earth those two values have any relationship with the percentage of long-term memory to retain).  Moreover, the weights and bias are shared, so there can be different iterations where the percentage of memory to retain should be much different, instead it's almost equal. How is it handling this case or why does it make sense at all? Then, the forget gate I feel like it's a better definition. If the output of the sigmoid is very small(say 0), then we are going to forget anything we learnt till now(in the long-term), thus the subsequent long-term memory would be 0(+ current long-term memory data). Why, though? What if for the following ""days"" we needed some information from that long term memory previous to this day?",True

I thought that was avoided through using the same weights and biases all along the LSTM unit as long as the weigths are not greater than one  but on the other hand not too small.

@kylek29,2022-11-08T00:08:33Z,276,"As someone who has watched a ton of videos on these topics, I can say that you probably do the best job of explaining the underlying functionality in a simple to follow way. So many other educators put up the standard flowchart for a model and then talk about it. Having the visual examples of data going in and changing throughout really helps hammer the concept home.",True
@ttominable,2022-11-07T20:03:40Z,3,"Im a native spanish speaker and when this video played speaking spanish my face was genuine horror, mainly because im used to josh’s voice. I’m glad i could switch it back",True

@jishanahmed225,2022-11-07T17:31:11Z,0,"Hi Dr. Starmer, could please make a video for tabular data classification using LSTM. I had a hard time to understand LSTM for tabular data classification. Most of the online examples for LSTM are for texts data classification. I couldn't find one for tabular data classification using LSTM! I appreciate your efforts to make our learning fun!  Thanks!",True
@UsernameUsername0000,2022-11-07T16:40:24Z,1,This is so funny because I was subscribed for a while and today thought “Hmm let me see if Statquest has a video on LSTM because I really need it.” And what do you know…,True
@gennahlopov2102,2022-11-07T15:56:47Z,1,Great video thanks,True
@kamilalyakaev3187,2022-11-07T15:12:21Z,1,"Gah! It is such a bad timing, I had my midterm on this a week ago... Great video nevertheless!",True
@statquest,2022-11-07T15:07:44Z,34,"To learn more about Lightning: https://lightning.ai/ Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/ NOTE: Since LSTM is a type of neural network, we find the best Weights and Biases using backpropagation, just like for any other neural network. For more details on how backpropagation works, see: https://youtu.be/IN2XmBhILt4 https://youtu.be/iyn2zdALii8 and https://youtu.be/GKZoOHXGcLo The only difference with LSTMs is that you have to unroll them for all of your data first and then calculate the derivatives. In the example in this video, that means unrolling the LSTM 4 times (as seen at 17:49) and calculate the derivatives for each variable, starting at the output, for each copy and then add them together. ALSO NOTE: A lot of people ask why the predictions the LSTM makes for days other than day 5 are bad. The reason is that in order to illustrate how, exactly, an LSTM works, I had to use a simple example, and this simple example only works if it is trained to predict day 5 and only day 5.",True
@jakob2946,2022-11-07T15:02:54Z,0,"Are thee types of networks just for sequential data like this? What if we have multiple inputs per ""day"" and want one prediction. How does it join the two resulting short term memories",True
@kostaskyr,2022-11-07T14:50:15Z,2,Excellent video! Waiting for a video about attention and transforers!,True

@aayushjariwala6256,2022-11-07T13:41:32Z,19,Requested a video on NLP some time ago and here StatQuest with a better explanation than I expected! (Other YouTubers and Courses taught me 'How LSTM works?' but your explanation taught 'Why LSTM works?' The clarification between sigmoid and tanh solved many of my questions),True
@toyuyn,2022-11-07T09:48:55Z,0,I like to remember LSTMs as differentiable counters which can increment/decrement (using tanh in the input gate) or reset values (using sigmoid in forget gate) in memory.,True

This was a very clear and well illustrated example of how they work. Hopefully the percentage of what I now know about LSTMs that is added to my long term memory is now approaching one. Thank you! I'm waiting, with great attention, for the transformer video!!!",True
