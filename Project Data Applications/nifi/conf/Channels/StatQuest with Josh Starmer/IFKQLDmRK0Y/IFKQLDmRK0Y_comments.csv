@Azazello1482,2023-11-29T19:17:56Z,0,"I don't quite understand something. At 3:08 you draw a line and say ""this is the 0.25 quantile because 25% of the points are less than this line."" However, this is not true. There are 15 points total, and only 3 are less than the 0.25 quantile line. Later in the video at 4:55, you draw a line through the same point and call it the 20th quantile/percentile. You then conclude, ""I've shown you just one way to calculate the quantiles and percentiles, however, there are many more."" Did you not just show us two significantly different ways that would have a meaningful impact on downstream calculations and interpretation? My head is spinning.",True

@witnessa7x,2020-11-12T06:05:45Z,0,"I feel like I understood the video, but I feel like I'm missing a logical jump.  We said that in a sample with fifteen data points the 50% quantile would have seven points below it, and seven points above it.  Fair enough.  15/2=7.5, and perhaps that 0.5 comes from the line going through the median point itself.  But this doesn't really seem to generalize well in the scheme you present at the beginning of this video.  Perhaps its best shown by saying at 2:56 you highlight a purple point as being the 25% quantile because you've bisected twice.  However, at 4:52 you refer to that same point as the 20% quantile, because three of the fifteen points are below it.  Both approaches make some intuitive sense to me, but they give notably different results for quantile measurement.",True
