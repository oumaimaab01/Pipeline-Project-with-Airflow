@taotaotan5671,2020-06-13T03:42:22Z,0,"Thanks Josh for this great course. I was wondering what statistical tests should be used if the data is not normally distributed. Specifically, I am interested in RNA-seq differential expression analysis, in which case the read counts have a negative binomial distribution. However, t-test/ANOVA assumes normally distributed data. What will be a good way to handle this situation? Should I use log transformation? However, from what I know, log transformation does not necessarily correct the skewness of the data.   I know this question is not quite relevant to the content of this video, but it's much appreciated if you could reply.  Thank you very much.",True
