Like in this question, i can make two groups, group one: all residuals of using the average, group two: all residuals of using the line, then do an ANOVA(or T test) to see whether the difference is significance, would you say its the same thing in essence as calculating the F statistics for R squared.

When we run the regression on multiple variables then you would notice that along with each variable a standard error is given. How is that calculated 3. To test the significance of a variable why do we need a t statistic/z statistic. Why can't we work with absolute numbers. In case pf z/t statistic are we not transforming it to a different scale/co-ordinated plane. Then why can't we work with the absolute numbers. And if we do work with absolute numbers then how do we deduce if the variable is significant or not because then z statistic/t statistic won't work. Please correct me if I am wrong, the aim with t /z statistic is to transform the observed sample mean of an independent variable to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and then make sure the transformed mean is significantly different from 0 because of the coefficient is 0 then the variable holds no importance in the model",True

@mostinho7,2020-05-22T07:14:19Z,1,"7:20 what R^2 means How much of the variance in the y data can be explained by taking the x data into account. Taking the x data into account here means shifting the line around which we measure the variance from just being a flat line in the middle of the y data to being the regression line with respect to x data. R^2 = (variance around flat line - variance around regression line) / variance around flat line  The higher R^2 is, means the variance around the regression line is lower and we have a better fit - stronger correlation between the variables  12:20 predicting variable based on two variables instead of one. Two variables on the z and x axis, the prediction is the y axis. In this case we fit a plane to the data not a line. The plane has 3 parameters.  13:30 we fit a plane 14:20 if the tail length variable in the z axis isn‚Äôt useful (doesn‚Äôt give a higher R^2) then the least squares method will give it a coefficient of 0. Equations with more parameters won‚Äôt make the sum of squares around the fit worse than an equation with fewer parameters. Least squares will make parameters that make R^2 around the fit worse have 0 coefficient. So having more parameters won‚Äôt make our r^2 worse, but it could make it better due to random chance. (Without there actually being a correlation)  15:50 we report an adjusted R^2 that scales R^2 by the number of params in the model  16:00 R^2 needs a p-value  Todo:- Continue isA",True

@urdeathisnear885,2020-05-07T16:52:26Z,0,"Hey Josh, questions for you regarding interpretation of p-value in this regression analysis/model comparison. What is the null hypothesis in this case? If we get a significant p-value, what hypothesis are we rejecting, what are we saying about our model fit, and how could we report an effect size?  In typical NHST, if we got a significant p-value, we'd say something like ""given our null hypothesis is true, this is the probability that we would observe a result at least as rare as the observed result, and because it is is less than some significance level, we reject our null hypothesis and make the claim that we think that this result does not come from the distribution specified by the null hypothesis, though we realize this claim may be a false positive with value equal to our p-value.""",True

Why do I feel that there is a difference between the way regression is taught in a statistics class and machine learning class?  Typically, all statistics classes online and 1 offline course I have taken explain the regression using normal form solution of least square. They further get into significance and diagnostics of residuals, leverage points etc.  There is some emphasis on assumptions like errors being distributed normally etc.  On the other hand, machine learnings (usually CS) courses talk about gradient descent algorithm instead of normal form solution. The focus is solely on prediction without caring much about diagnostics?  Why am I seeing this difference and why would something be more important in one area and not in another?",True

He has outside data, collected via a survey, showing that the correlation between the student‚Äôs exam grade and the number of hours spent on Facebook in the days before the exam is about -0.12. If the researcher wanted to use linear regression to predict the exam score for a student who spent 6 hours on Facebook before his exam, which is of the following bestdescribes the researcher‚Äôs situation? 1.He should use linear regression since the correlation coefficient is not 0 it is clear that there is a linear relationship between the two variables. 2.He should use linear regression. Because of the negative correlation, spending more time on Facebook leads to lower exam scores.. 3.He should use linear regression. He can predict the exam score for a student who spent 6 hours on Facebook before the exam using the equation score = 100 + 6 √ó (‚àí0.12). 4.He should not use linear regression because the correlation is not strong enough. 5.He needs to plot the data (e.g. a scatterplot) before deciding whether to use linear regression.  3.Question Which of the following is false? 1.A data point that has a negative residual is located below the regression line. 2.The variability of residuals should increase as x increases. 3.Residuals of linear models should be distributed nearly normally around 0. 4.The residuals plot (residuals vs. xx) should show a random scatter around 0.  .Question 5  For a certain professional basketball team, 32% of the variability in the team‚Äôs points scored per game is explained by the total salary of the opposing team. For this particular team, which of the following could be the correlation between their points scored per game and the salary of the opposing team? 1. ‚àí0.322=‚àí0.102 2. ‚àí0.32‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àö=‚àí0.566 3. 1‚àí0.322=0.998 4. 1‚àí0.32‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àí‚àö=0.434  6.Question 6  A student is studying the relationship between how much money students spend on food and on entertainment per week. Based on a sample size of 270, he calculates a correlation coefficient of 0.013 for these two variables. Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation? 1.This low correlation of 0.013 indicates there is no relationship. 2.There is no linear relationship but there may be a nonlinear relationship. 3.This correlation indicates a definite strong nonlinear relationship. 4.This correlation indicates there is a strong linear relationship.   8. Question 8 Which of the following best describes SST (sum of squares total) in a regression? Strength of the model fit. 1 Total variability in the explanatory variable. 2 Total variability in the response variable. 3 Explained variability in the response variable. 4 Unexplained variability in the response variable. 1 point",True

@marvalisapayne9134,2019-08-05T03:13:54Z,0,Josh you give great explanations of what R^2 means intuitively. Now you can obtain R^2 by squaring the correlation coefficient R?  These two formulas look completely different.  Your formula has only the dependent variable y; most formulas I see with R have both independant and dependent variables. For instance r= 1/(n-1)*sum ZxZy or r=sum(xi-x-bar)(yi-ybar)/((sqrt(sumxi-x-bar)^2)*(sqrt(sum(yi-y-bar)^2))).  Would it involve some tricky math to show how these two equations are related? They seem to be measuring different things R measures the correlations among the data points and R^2 measures the difference of the variation of the mean and fit divided by variation of the mean.  How can these two variables be related?,True

@lilmoesk899,2017-08-22T03:48:07Z,1,"For some reason I've never been able to understand the two equations for R-squared that I find in textbooks/online. I've seen ones like the one you present here (var(mean) - var(fit))/(var(mean)) but then I also see 1 - SS(residuals)/SS(total). It's most likely my bad algebra that is preventing me from seeing how the two equations are the same. Any chance you explain how the two equations are actually the same thing?Here's my attempt! So the 1st definition tells us how much our 'best fit' line (whose parameters were acquired by minimizing the sum of squared errors)improves the variance of predictions (in percent terms)? The 2nd definition, however, says take 100% (1 = 100/100=100%) of the sum of squares using the mean of our data (the SStotal--our naive model), then subtract from that the ratio sum of squared errors of our best fit and the total sum of squared errors from the mean. The difference between these numbers tells us... and this is where my understanding breaks down. Why can't we just say SSres/SStot is the explained variation? Why the ""1 - "" part?",True
