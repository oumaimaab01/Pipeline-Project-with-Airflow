@Rictoo,2024-01-27T13:41:57Z,0,"I have a question! At 3:35 you say ""ArgMax will output 1 for any other value greater than 0.23"" - but shouldn't it be ""greater than 1.43"", because ArgMax points to the value that is the highest in the set of outputs? Other related question: And then is the intuition that if we know the true value of Virginica (e.g., if the training sample was truly Virginica), then if the ArgMax is 0 for Virginica on that training example (because we predicted it wrong), then we essentially ""Wouldn't know how to get to the right answer"", because we have no slope pointing towards the right answer? We're just told ""You're wrong. Not telling you _how_ wrong, just wrong."" which isn't helpful for learning.",True

Logistic regression can also theoretically converge to different parameter estimates based on initial weights - just like neural networks. But we still consider their output to be a representation of probability - specifically because they are fit to maximise log likelihood. Why can't similar logic be applied to Neural Network classification. The parameter estimates might vary, but as long as we are maximising log likelihood (and minimising the most common loss cross entropy), are we not predicting probabilities...?",True

The way you describe it works implies that argmax returns a vector of 0s (having 1 in the position of maximum value) which is of the same length as the input vector. However, the way argmax works in numpy or pytorch libraries is by returning a scalar value indicating the position instead of a vector. Given this difference, what is the true behaviour of argmax?
