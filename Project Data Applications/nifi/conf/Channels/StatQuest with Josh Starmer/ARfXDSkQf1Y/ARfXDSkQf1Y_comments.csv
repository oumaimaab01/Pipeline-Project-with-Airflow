@statquest,2020-01-07T00:53:32Z,92,"NOTE: In statistics, machine learning and many programming languages, like Java, R and Python, the default base for the log function is 'e'. So log(0.17) = ""log base e of 0.17"" = -1.77. The natural log (log to base 'e') is used because it often simplifies the mathematics that underpins statistics. That said, you can use whatever base you would like as long as you are consistent. Also, at 10:00, I say that a histogram of the log(odds) has the shape of a normal distribution, but what I should have said is that the shape is *similar* to a normal distribution and is *approximated* with a normal distribution. Lastly, people often ask about how to generate the normal distribution: First, I randomly selected a number between 1 and 100 and I get 32. That means I will use 32 as the numerator for the odds. The denominator is then 100-32 = 68. Then I calculate the log(32 / 68) and get -0.75 (because I use log base 'e', but you can use any log base as long as you are consistent). Then I pick another random number between 1 and 100 and get 54. This means that the numerator for my odds is 54 and the denominator is 100-54 = 46. So I calculate the log(54 / 46)=0.16. Then I just repeat that process a bunch of times (100s) and draw a histogram of the log(odds) values. If I do this, I will get a normal distribution.

@statquest,2020-01-07T00:53:32Z,92,"NOTE: In statistics, machine learning and many programming languages, like Java, R and Python, the default base for the log function is 'e'. So log(0.17) = ""log base e of 0.17"" = -1.77. The natural log (log to base 'e') is used because it often simplifies the mathematics that underpins statistics. That said, you can use whatever base you would like as long as you are consistent. Also, at 10:00, I say that a histogram of the log(odds) has the shape of a normal distribution, but what I should have said is that the shape is *similar* to a normal distribution and is *approximated* with a normal distribution. Lastly, people often ask about how to generate the normal distribution: First, I randomly selected a number between 1 and 100 and I get 32. That means I will use 32 as the numerator for the odds. The denominator is then 100-32 = 68. Then I calculate the log(32 / 68) and get -0.75 (because I use log base 'e', but you can use any log base as long as you are consistent). Then I pick another random number between 1 and 100 and get 54. This means that the numerator for my odds is 54 and the denominator is 100-54 = 46. So I calculate the log(54 / 46)=0.16. Then I just repeat that process a bunch of times (100s) and draw a histogram of the log(odds) values. If I do this, I will get a normal distribution.

@etsevnevo1315,2018-11-14T18:45:16Z,1,"Thank you for your generosity and kindness! 10:02 , Is the log(odds) of a uniformly distributed X actually Normally distributed or just similar in *""shape""* to a Normal distribution?",True
@nicholas1460,2018-11-06T23:06:03Z,38,Oh snap. I always conceptualized odds and probability as exactly the same thing. I am now in an existential crisis. The world around me no longer makes sense. Why oh why did I come here … :(,True
@prabal37,2018-10-23T03:43:10Z,1,REALLY AWESOME!!! A BIG THANK YOU,True
@youssefesseddiq7453,2018-10-17T09:00:19Z,3,Can you please explain what do you mean by using those pairs to calculate the log(odds)...like what are the odds we calculating anyway? Thank you!,True
@youssefesseddiq7453,2018-10-17T08:53:18Z,1,I unconsciously said 'DOUBLE BAAM' after that second conclusion and double bam it was xD!,True

@nathan2as,2018-09-14T04:30:12Z,1,At the end i learnt the logit function..Thanks a lot Sir ....One quick question odd tend to be between 0-infinity.But lets assume the total match played is 1 and my team won...in such case odds = 1/0 ..how we calculate log(odd) here ??..Pls help me to understand better,True
@paedrufernando2351,2018-09-03T14:44:16Z,2,Why is the pairs of numbers that add up to 100 symmetrical,True

@NandDulalDas2810,2018-07-31T11:46:29Z,1,Simply great,True
@hcgaron,2018-07-24T00:35:23Z,1,Why on earth does my probabilistic systems textbook not explain this concept... BAM!,True
@urbanhairess,2018-06-28T08:43:51Z,2,The BEST explanation. Thank you!!!,True

@tallwaters9708,2018-05-08T07:04:37Z,0,"Wow really well explained, I'm surprised how many bad teachers there are in the world, but you're not one of them.  So you throw that into a sigmoid function to complete logistic regression?   Why can't you just use probability instead of all this odds stuff?",True
@chyldstudios,2018-05-08T03:59:21Z,1,Triple BAM!,True
@StephenRoseDuo,2018-05-08T03:16:07Z,36,THE GAME'S BEEN CHANGED!!!! DOUBLE BAM IS NOT ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!,True
