@nathanshraer7978,2022-06-22T11:51:45Z,1,"Thank you for all your videos that helped me understand better stats, and thanks for this recipe which I precisely followed at home.  Juste have to mention that I had to add a good amount of flour after I noticed my dough was much stickier than yours in the video.. I don‚Äôt understand where did I fail: 500gr flour, 500gr water and 1/8 tsp yeast. Then after 10 hours or so, 500gr of flour and 200gr of water (and 20gr salt), exactly like in the video! Then folded the dough Avery 20‚Äô for 1 and a half hour. My dough was definitely too sticky. I would consider adding less water to that recipe",True
