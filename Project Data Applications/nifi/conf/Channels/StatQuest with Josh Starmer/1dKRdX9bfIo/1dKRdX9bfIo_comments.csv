Do you mean a Lasso is fit first to see which coefficients are non-zero to check usefulness, then subsequently fit Ridge in hopes that it will help on test set performance? What exactly is done first to ascertain that ""most variables are useful""?

Is a larger coefficient more useful? Or small coefficients on variables that give good test set prediction performance are useful?",True

@scutily,2019-03-13T08:58:36Z,2,Really nice videos! It's very well explained and helpful!  Can you also do videos on adaptive elastic net and multi-step elastic net ? Thank you so much!,True
@gonchedanesh6731,2019-02-26T16:29:49Z,0,Thank you so much for this ! I just don't see when ridge can be better than lasso ?,True

@haneensuradi,2019-02-20T17:44:51Z,5,Thanks for this amazing series! It is making my life way easier while I am taking Machine Learning course in university.  Can you please 'clearly explain' what do you mean by correlated variables? And what Elastic Net regression does to them?,True
@Yzhang250,2019-02-19T19:58:23Z,1,"Hi Josh, Just revisited this video and very clearly explained. But what are the disadvantages of elastic net? Is this model more computational expensive?",True
@maskew,2019-02-05T11:13:44Z,2,"Hi Josh, great video! There's just one thing that I'm confused about. I understand that Elastic-Net is meant to provide the best of both worlds out of Lasso and Ridge regression but I'm struggling to get my head around what this means. You said that   ""Elastic-Net regression - groups and shrinks the parameters associated with the correlated variables and leaves them in the equation or removes them all at once"".   What's the advantage to keeping all of the correlated variables in the equation? I thought that this was a bad thing to do since they are likely providing the same information to the model more than once. Also, does Lasso always keep a single variable of a correlated variable group, even if the group doesn't actually help at all to make predictions?",True
@jyotimawri6772,2019-02-03T12:50:16Z,1,"Hi Josh , i have doubt ... we usually remove the correlated variables while performing data cleaning , so why are we considering these correlated variables ??",True

@sowmy525,2018-11-27T15:27:15Z,14,Thank you StatQuest...awesome series :) Can you do videos on time series methods as well ...clearly explained :P,True
@kenn756,2018-11-13T15:15:15Z,2,I am disappointed you didn't show a net made of rubber for elastic net.,True
@innamemetova5923,2018-11-02T08:48:32Z,1,"Sorry, mb its a bit silly, but.. Don't we need brackets after lambda1 for all absolute parameters  and brackets after lambda2? 3:46 in the video",True
@javiermenac,2018-10-28T06:12:48Z,1,"I'm from Chile... i 've loved your videos of regularization, specially each intro!!!",True
@sachof,2018-10-23T22:48:03Z,4,"You are awesome... I gonna buy a t-shirt with ""I love StatQuest"" written on it !",True
@xiangnan-oz9hs,2018-10-22T13:18:19Z,1,"Thanks very much, StatQuest. each lecture is fantastic and interesting. Looking forward to your clearly explanation of Bayesian statistics, MCMC, MH, Gibbs sampling, etc.",True
@paulstevenconyngham7880,2018-10-15T09:37:38Z,1,"hey man, might you be able to do a wee vid on z-score?",True
@resonatingvoice1,2018-10-13T22:51:05Z,1,I mean how easy can it get ... these views are the perfect example of how complex algorithms can be explained in simple and then later people can dive into the actual math behind it to get the full picture... Awesome ... thanks,True
