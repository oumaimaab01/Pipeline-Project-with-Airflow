@arenashawn772,2023-12-30T18:03:33Z,0,"Here when you are showing the in the 3D plot how the summed residuals are changing with both the intercept b and the slope a of the fitting lines, I know it is really hard to actually draw a clear cartoon of it, but would the 3D shape be like a bowl with its slope at zero at some (a, b) coordinate in every possible direction? I remember in physics when dealing with potential energy in space we called this as “finding the local minima”. My question would be 1) is it possible there are two sets of (a, b) values that provides this local minima? 2) is it always possible to find a local minima where the slope is zero in every direction? 3) what is the fitting actually found a local minima in one direction but a local maxima (which would also have slope zero) in the perpendicular direction? Would it be able to differentiate and tell this is not a good fit?  Sorry for the long winded questions. I know these are probably not things I should concern myself with when using an established fitting algorithm or software package for least squares, as someone else must have thought of them and solved them.

I do have a query & it would be super great of you could answer it.    I wanted to understand the detailed mathematics of Sum Of Least Squares. I stumble upon a formula for finding the slope and intercept of best fit line directly Photos can't be uploaded here so, pasting the link to the video where the formula is explained. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtGkSQPLSK0 So,using this formula, we can directly get the best fit line.     So I have got a bit confused with relation between the sum of least square method and this formula. Is the sum of least square method and this formula same or two different things?   If we have the formula to find best fit line directly then why we have sum of least square method.   If we already have a formula for finding m, then why do we need to go the SSE way and keep rotating the line around Xi, Yi to find the best slope (and intercept)?   What is the relation between the two? If they are different the what is the mathematics behind Sum Of Least Squares?  Am I missing some thing basic here?   Thanks a lot :)",True

@prasshanthvp1082,2020-10-18T09:41:10Z,1,"Finding optimal slope and intercepts is done by the machine, however we would need to tell the machine ""how to do it"" in order to get the values of intercept and slope. There are various ways to do this.   If you are a comfortable programmer, you could write a function which changes slope and intercept for varying values, and pick the values which brings the least sum of squares errors . If you know certain optimization  techniques like Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, you could ask the machine to use these algorithm and solve for intercept and slopes, where it uses the concept of slope of function being least or the ""derivatives"". If you know linear algebra and matrices really well, you could solve for intercept and slopes using Normal Equation.   Note: I have used 'slopes' instead of 'slope', this means I am using many input variables, which you will find out more in future StatQuest videos. (Proud promotion of StatQuest videos!)  For smaller data, it's not very important to know these concepts, since using any of them will bring us to the same values of intercept and slopes. When the complexity increases a.k.a millions of data and thousands of input variables, each optimization techniques may not arrive at same results. Also, you will have practical challenges and constraints like available time, speed, processing power, etc.  In such cases, it might be useful to know (i) what are few optimization techniques, and (ii) when to apply each of them.

@av3499,2020-08-03T09:20:58Z,0,"I still don't understand/accept the reason for using squares of residuals instead of actual or absolute residuals - that it's ""easy to differentiate"". The simplest/intuitive way to measure error is to get difference between actual and predicted. I do not want to pander to outliers by squaring their large differences. I want every data point to be treated the same. Heck, I might even want to measure actual difference instead of absolute, and let the opposites cancel each other out.  for e.g. if X is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. and Y is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. I would choose a simple Y=X line, which would give me sum of absolute differences as 1. But if it do OLS, it gives a complicated Y = 1.054X - 0.2, where sum of absolute differences is 1.84.  I do not want that. Is there a mathematical method (that is easily explained like you always do), to minimize the actual difference, and the absolute difference, instead of squared difference?  I don't know why all school/undergrad/grad teachers jump directly to the end result without explaining the process behind why the simplest intuitions were tried, and why they didn't work, or why this particular solution was accepted as a trade-off.

@PinkFloydTheDarkSide,2019-10-13T21:16:59Z,1,"Squaring is not required to make error terms positive. Absolute value is enough to achieve that. There has to be some very specific reason behind using the squared terms and I could not find a perfect answer to it anywhere over the internet. Some say it is because it helps using Euclidean distance formula if we want to figure out some value. Others say it is because it increases the magnitude of the value and so if we try some calculation that may reduce the value, it won't go down to zero.  Have you ever tried to figure out the real reason behind squaring? It will be helpful to know the real reason. Thank you.",True

@mistercakes,2019-09-11T09:16:27Z,0,"thanks for this video.  the 3rd concept is very hard to understand, even with your example.  with the example you have sum of squared residuals, slope and the intercept.  are the X & Y fixed based on the previous concept?  i'm a bit lost.  let's say i want to compare two different best fit lines and i want to see which is better.  i understand that you can just find whichever has a smaller sum of least squares.  what i'm looking to understand is how the 3rd concept (the graph with the z dimension) can help me better find the absolute best fit line.  is this what this is solving for?",True

@ElNick09,2018-12-21T17:16:21Z,3,"I know you made clear that people don't do the work of deriving the function and finding the tangent slope of 0 for a line that gives the least squares by hand... but could you post a link to an image showing this derivation? I a.) believe that the math works and b.) understand the concept and what the derivation is doing... but I feel like i have to see the math and at least try to figure out how the various parts of an equation are working before I can really say 'I get it'.   I just hate to leave something as a 'black box' in my understanding of a topic if I can help it at all.   Fantastic videos by the way, I think these may be the best stats lessons on youtube.",True
