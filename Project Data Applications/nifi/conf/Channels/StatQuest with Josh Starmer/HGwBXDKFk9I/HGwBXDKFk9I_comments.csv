Because the input nodes come after the filters, activations, and pooling, and the only thing optimized after the input nodes are present are the weights and biases that lead it to some output. So how do the filters go to the diagonal bottom left to top right from some other initialized arrangement of the filter? Any help is appreciated.",True

When do we provide input to Relu function? When do we provide input to maxx pooling and finally when do we provide input to neural network? The reason I am asking this is due to sliding window concept which covers initially part of image and then slides over to cover entire image. So do we apply input to Relu when we have filled only few values in input feature map (because sliding is still ongoing on main input image) or we apply input to Relu when entire feature map is filled with data. Similarly on when we provide input to max pooling? Is it when we have finished Relu on entire feature map because Relu also take once cell of feature map ,perform Relu and give output. And finally when is input provided to NN? Is it after we have finished complete Max pooling? as it also works on sliding window concept.",True
