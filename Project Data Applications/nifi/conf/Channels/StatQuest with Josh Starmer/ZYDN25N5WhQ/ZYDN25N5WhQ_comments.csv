@christylee320,2023-04-07T04:59:54Z,1,"LOL!  A funny way using the conversation among Norm, adorable StatSquatch and bamGPT to introduce such a wonderful musical instrument!  Thank you so much for this YouTube channel, your great humor and your book!  The following conversation between Squatch and Norm to introduce you was composed by chatGPT when I asked it to use a funny way to introduce you!  Norm: Hey Squatch, have you ever watched any videos from ""StatQuest with Josh Starmer""?  Squatch: ""StatQuest""? Is that like a superhero team or something?  Norm: No, no, it's actually a YouTube channel run by a data scientist named Josh Starmer. He creates these really helpful videos that teach complex statistical concepts in a way that's easy to understand.  Squatch: Ah, gotcha. Yeah, I've heard of him. He's got that crazy beard, right?  Norm: Haha, yeah, he does have a pretty impressive beard. But more importantly, he's a real expert in his field and has a knack for making statistics fun and accessible.  Squatch: Well, that's a tall order. I've always found statistics to be pretty dry and boring.  Norm: That's exactly why Josh Starmer's videos are so great. He uses humor and visual aids to make these concepts more engaging and memorable. And trust me, as someone who's taken more than my fair share of statistics classes, that's no small feat.  Squatch: Alright, you've convinced me. I'll check out ""StatQuest"" and see if I can finally wrap my head around this whole statistics thing.  Norm: Great! And who knows, maybe you'll even be inspired to grow a beard like Josh Starmer's.  Squatch: Haha, I don't think that's gonna happen, Norm. But I'm definitely excited to learn from one of the best in the business.  By chatGPT",True
