@statquest,2019-11-21T17:57:39Z,102,"Correction: 4:16 KNN should have 10 correct and 14 incorrect.  NOTE: There has been a debate if we should call the ""testing dataset"" a ""testing dataset"" or ""validation dataset"". In my opinion, this depends on the size of your dataset. We'd all like to have a large dataset that we can divide into three parts: Training, Validation and Testing, but that doesn't always happen in the real world.

Why Because, suppose we have 5 blocks. Consider first block is taken for testing and remaining for training in the first fold. For 2 fold we take 1345 for training and 2 blocks for testing right. But in the previous fold we used block 1 as testing but now in the second we are using that in training?? Does it lead to any data leakage right!! How to avoid this??",True

We only use test our final model on it ( which is found using cross validation) and that's it, if the results are not good, we do not try to make it better right?

For each set of hyperparameters it will train the model with different data 10 times, register the result and its average score.

How do we know what k-fold cv to use for 130 samples (very small data set), for instance? I've seen different views online for this and for data splits for training and testing. Most say 10-fold cv is only for really large data sets, while some examples say for 300 samples, use a 2/3 fold cv. With a minimum of 2 for k, I am concerned about what would work for my dataset with a 75/25 split (training and testing data), for instance. Thanks.",True

If it is all training data but when measuring the performance i use the K-Fold way, isn't it confusing? not apple to apple? thanks sir",True

@DB-in2mr,2021-03-31T17:48:29Z,2,"I always love your clips+ material and expression (great work and rithms!) but this time maybe you could have highlighted at least a couple of things in the end (and releasing 4 bams maybe!) : 1) k-fold cross validation that you presented is generally not the best choice for selecting ""across algorithms"" (although it is done regularly and erroneously). Basic k fold cross validation  (a resampling method indeed) is generally used by ML professionals (I am in this group)  for model tuning (that is averaging across test folds the best hyperparmaeter set ) only for the same single algorithm method: the selection/choice of an algorithm + its hyper-parameters  should never be based repeatedly on same test sets (even test folds!) as the real risk is an optimistic bias estimate or overfit (even with cross validations). In fact, if you want to chose/select both algos and hyper-parameters you would apply at least nested cross-validation where true error estimates are practically unbiased ((Bias in Error Estimation When Using Cross-Validation for Model Selection, BMC Bioinformatics, S. Varma and R. Simon, 7(1): 91, 2006)). 2) Alternatively splitting in training-validation-test set is still ideal to select algos+hypers in the validation set but then checking once for cross-generalization performance estimates on ""unseen data"" in the final test set. : )  nevertheless, you remain one most relevant and vibrant pit stops for statisticians, data science professionals and trainees alike : )  ciao Daniele",True

Quick question:  the discussion begins by describing ways to partition the data set i.e. first 25% for testing, last 75% for training etc. It sort of transitions from how to partition the data set *for a single method* to a way to compare multiple methods i.e. KNN vs SVM etc. Can we assume you mean - Use K-fold CV on each method, record the results, and then repeat for other methods? From there  choose the method  with the best overall performance? Perhaps an obvious question  ... Thanks again for all the videos - and songs of course.",True

One doubt, if I have temporal data (or in general, not independent data), can I use those machine learning methods? I work in marine ecology for example, and I have data from August to December, with a clear pattern change in environmental conditions throughout the months. So, if I select for testing the algorithm a ""specific"" block (i.e. 1st-15th August), I would be choosing a specific set of data in which there are a specific combination of environmental conditions significantly different from the rest of the period, and thus, I guess the prediction would be poor.

@random-ds,2019-01-08T23:33:17Z,2,"Thank you, your videos are awesome, keep up the good work. Still i have a question: I understood the fact that changing the testing data through cross validation can allow us to find the best method of ML to apply, by summing the correct and wrong answers in each test. But i don't see how it will allow us to find the best parameter to use. For example, will it try all the data sets possible with lot of different parameters and find which one has the least error? but there is an infinite of parameters... In a nutshell, how can changing testing data help us to find the best parameter...   Thank you in advance.",True
@pi2019,2019-01-05T20:16:08Z,1,"Hi, quick question-- when you say training the ML algorithm/methods, is the same thing as training our dataset? or am I missing something?",True

@Skandawin78,2019-01-02T20:34:30Z,2,"I'm confused. With cross validation aren't you exposing All the data to train the model or are you training different models with every combination? Pls clarify. Also I didn't understand the part where you show logistic regression, svm and one more model and say svm performed better ??",True
@perrygogas,2019-01-02T12:50:48Z,2,Hope you don't mind if I use the video in class?,True
@venkateswararaorajanala7176,2018-12-14T03:06:24Z,1,"Hi,   I have learned differently..we use cross validation not in testing step. Three things  when working with ML . 1) Training the model  2) select/tuning the hyperparameters 3)Testing the model.  for tuning or selecting the hyperparameters.we need some data.if we try to use the data which we kept aside for testing for tuning the hyperparameters. our model will have a sneak peak of the data and perform badly later (overfitting). so we need to have some data explicitly for tuning..but we have limited data to train. so we use cross validation while training. so  hyper parameters also can be tuned without having a sneakpeak of test data.  Please correct me if wrong.",True
@Lokomotoable,2018-12-10T21:43:02Z,2,"Your videos are awesome, really. Do you have a video just for the special case of leave-one-out crossvalidation?  I need to understand what it does. Maybe you can recommend another video or page where it is explained?",True

@dennisthegamer2376,2018-07-19T08:38:04Z,1,"couldn't you average the the validation rates of all the training runs for one model, instead of summarizing? If you have a lot of hyperparameters doesn't this method take forever? Because you have to train the models for a lot of combinations, and several times even because you are using corss-validation.",True

@naveenv3097,2018-04-25T04:09:02Z,1,"So, cross validation works best, if we have an ensemble of methods to compare?  it makes no sense to use cross validation on just one algorithm...right?",True
@ignacio560,2018-04-24T22:15:00Z,0,"I thought one would split the data into a training and testing set, and then further split the training data into a validation set, so that we never ever use the testing data while choosing hyperparameters (or else we might end up over fitting). This further splitting of the training data could be done with k-fold techniques for validation. Just curious about what your thoughts are on this. Thank you for the video.",True
