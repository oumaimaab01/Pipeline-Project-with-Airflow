@ferihalditanjung3631,2021-07-22T13:15:28Z,0,"Thanks for the video, its really amazing. But I have question. Assume your dataset have larger scale lets say between 70 until 100. With the mean lets say 80. When you shifting the data before bootstrapping, now the mean of data will be centered around zero. But now your observed mean is 80, how did you find the p values than? Because the value of boostrapping sample mean distribution range lets say vary between -4 until 4. On the video we can see that the observed value is 0.5 which is we can calculate area under -0.5 and over 0.5 and then calculate the sum. But how we can find the p values when the observed mean is large? Once again thank you so much for the video, I really appreciate it! BAAM! ✊",True

@ChituOkoli,2021-03-23T14:31:23Z,0,"I'm trying to follow this, but I am confused for the following reasons (possible errors, or my confusion?): * 12:05 says that 36% is between -0.5 and 0.5 * 12:40 says that 16% is <= -0.5 * 12:55 says that 48% is >= 0.5 (double checked for correctness)  But: * 14:43 says that the probability of >= 0.5 is 0.47 (not 0.48, as I would have expected from above) * 14:52 says that the probability of <= -0.5 is 0.16 (no problem there) * 15:04 the right tail of the histogram is not the same as from 14:43. The sixth bar from the right is missing its shading. This is an error, right?  If you can confirm that the 48% from 12.55 should be 47% and that the histogram is indeed missing a shaded bar from 15:04, then I think I follow. Please confirm if these are errors or if I am misunderstanding something important.",True
