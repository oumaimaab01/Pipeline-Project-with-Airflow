@statquest,2020-01-08T13:49:43Z,162,"Correction: 10:18. The Amount of Say for Chest Pain = (1/2)*log((1-(3/8))/(3/8)) = 1/2*log(5/8/3/8) = 1/2*log(5/3) = 0.25, not 0.42.  NOTE 0: The StatQuest Study Guide is available: https://app.gumroad.com/statquest NOTE 2: Also note: In statistics, machine learning and most programming languages, the default log function is log base 'e', so that is the log that I'm using here. If you want to use a different log, like log base 10, that's fine, just be consistent. NOTE 3: A lot of people ask if, once an observation is omitted from a bootstrap dataset, is it lost for good? The answer is ""no"". You just lose it for one stump. After that it goes back in the pool and can be selected for any of the other stumps. NOTE: 4: A lot of people ask ""Why is ""Heart Disease =No"" referred as ""Incorrect""""? This question is answered in the StatQuest on decision trees: https://youtu.be/_L39rN6gz7Y However, here's the short version: The leaves make classifications based on the majority of the samples that end up in them. So if most of the samples in a leaf did not have heart disease, all of the samples in the leaf are classified as not having heart disease, regardless of whether or not that is true. Thus, some of the classifications that a leaf makes are correct, and some are not correct.

In the quasi-sigmoid function (8:34) of Total Say vs. Total Error.. when you say that if the stump is extremely bad.. then it has a highly negative say..   But I was thinking.. for a total error of -> 1 (limit approaching 1).. that would essentially classify as a stump which is always incorrect.. and if we know that.. we could simply perform a NOT operation on the stump prediction.. and get the correct prediction right? In other words.. what I am trying to say is that total error of 0.5 ( translating to a total Say of 0) is much worse of a predictor than a stump with a total error of -> 1 so maybe a more accurate formula for the Amount of Say could be the modulus of 0.5*log((1-total error)/total error))  Please excuse me if this doesn't make sense at all.. :),True

@rusho906,2022-12-22T00:11:01Z,0,"This is a great explanation. I'm coming here from your gradient boosting videos, and one of the best things about those videos in my opinion is the separate videos you did going through the theory. Maybe something like that could benefit this topic slightly as well. In particular, one thing that I was hoping you would go into is the details of how the re-weighting of samples can be done. In particular, if we never re-sample but rather just keep re-weighting, it works out quite nicely that the sum of weights for all mislabeled points would be 1/2 after reweighting. Same for all of the correctly predicted points, after reweighting, they all add up to 1. I thought, that made the implementation simpler, as opposed to the original ""multiply by exponential term, normalize everything"" approach.

@nikhilchalla6658,2022-11-09T22:22:47Z,0,"Hello Josh, Thank you for the amazing videos. I had a couple of questions on stumps that are created after Sample weights are updated at time 16:00. We continue with sampling from the full set assuming new weights. This means the new set will be a subset of the original dataset as you explained in 18:32 . Going forward all subsequent stumps will only work on smaller and smaller subsets, making it a bit confusing for me on how to ensure good randomness. 1. Do we also restart from the updated sample weights at 16:00 and redo sampling, thereby creating multiple different datasets but using the same sample weight values? This will probably ensure we use all the data from the original data set in some instances. 2. As a follow-up to Q1, do we perform multiple sampling at different levels to get more variations in the dataset before creating stumps? In the video, you described only one instance of sampling using new weights but I assume it needs to be performed multiple times to get variations in datasets. 3. Do we not sample from distribution at the very beginning also? All sample weights will have the same value but random sampling would mean some might not make it to the first round of ( stump creation + Amount of say + New sample weights ) itself to get unequal sample weights at 16:00. In the video you take all the samples by default hence the query.",True

@jagdishchhabria1795,2022-10-14T12:44:18Z,0,"Hi Josh - I found your explanation a little confusing around the 5 minute mark from the start. You said something along the lines of ""Of the 5 observations with Chest Pain, 3 were correctly classified and 2 were incorrectly classified. And of the 3 observations without chest pain, 2 were correctly classified and one was not."" But isn't it the case that all the 8 observations have chest pain, and the Yes/No values in the first column are predictions about the patient had heart disease or not? That's the reason why you can judge whether they are correctly classified or not by comparing to the Actual values in the Heart Disease column. In short, I think the Yes/No values in column 1 pertain to predicted Heart Disease and not the presence/absence of Chest Pain. All 8 observations are for patients with Chest Pain, and not just 5 of them. I'd appreciate it if you can please clarify if I am thinking about this in the right way or did I make a mistake?

I have a few questions that came to me when watching the video and reading some of the comments and trying to implement this myself that I couldn't find the answer in the video or in the stat quest for this video I purchased:   1: Regarding your note 3 in the pinned comment: if we put the observations back in the dataset to be selected for other stumps, what weight is to be associated with the samples (both included and not included in the 'new dataset')?       - And if we are using the original dataset for future stumps, (as far as I understand by your note, but maybe I am incorrect as you say ""get rid of the original"" at 18:08) what is the point of making new weights all initialized at 1/total for this new dataset if this dataset is not used for these future stumps?  2: What are we to do if there are more options than just ""yes"" and ""no"" for a variable, say for example we added ""sometimes"" for chest pain, what would be the stump(s) created for this variable like at 5:30? Would it be CHEST PAIN that has branches to yes, no, and sometimes? Could you give an example of making a stump(s) for this variable with 3 different options?  3: How possible is it for you to make a part 2 that includes a variable with more than 2 options and the third iteration of making stumps haha? I think this would help so we can see how this new dataset's weights effects our original dataset and shows an example of your note 3 of picking out of the original dataset a second time.

Then e^amountofsay will be between 0 and 1. It should be the left side of this e^x plot, not the right side. Then the new weight is not increased, it decreases......Your statement is right when stump does a great job. When the stump does a great job, the total error will be close to 0 and the amount of say will be large positive values. The e^-amountofsay will be between 0 and 1, meaning reduce weight for correct samples.",True

@bibiworm,2021-01-13T22:27:48Z,1,"May I ask a couple of questions please? Hopefully, you can help shed some light. 1. What is the threshold for a prediction flip? Do we flip as long as total error rate is larger than 0.5, i.e., amount of say is negative? Or we only flip if total error rate is larger than 0.6 or 0.7? Or it is a hyper-parameter to be tuned?  2. Can we say that weighted Gini index and sample weights update achieve the same goal but through different mechanisms? Recall that in order to mitigate class imbalance, we could either apply class weights or sample weights. I see the resemblance here.   Thank you!",True
@rakshiths3220,2021-01-10T14:52:35Z,0,will the stump built in k th stage take into account the errors made by all of the previous stumps or only the error made by (k-1)th stump??  for example will the stump made at 3rd stage take into account errors made by stumps at 2nd and 1st stage or only the 2nd stage?

If I take 0.5*log(7) then my amount of say would be 0.422 whereas in reality you have used 0.5*ln(7) which gives 0.97 as the amount of say.

I see the 'weight' is reused when bootstrapping is used, but how about if we still using Gini?  2) if same set of criteria is re-used, then we would get a bunch of stumps with same criteria but differ only with the amount of say. Why is that useful in this case, other than simply using each criteria once only?  3) if the same set of criteria is re-used, then how can we determine when to stop the stump building process and settle down to calculate which classification result group has larger amount of say?

@PaulXiaofangLan,2020-06-23T01:41:57Z,0,"Dear Josh, I have 2 more questions.   For Random Forest, we use bagging to generate many trees. But you haven't introduced this idea for AdaBoost.  1. Does that mean, the `amount of say` of all trumps is determined by the whole data set (corpus)? 2. How many AdaBoost stumps we should generate? What's the rule to determine the number? 3. Could a stump share the same features with other stumps?  And, as you mentioned, the creation of the first stump will effect the second stump. My second question is: 1. How to determine which feature we should use for the first stump? By entropy/Gini comparison between the features?  2. If it is, is the idea of the first stump creation applied to the second stump, thus third, fourth, etc. Thanks.",True

NOTE 0: The StatQuest Study Guide is available: https://app.gumroad.com/statquest NOTE 2: Also note: In statistics, machine learning and most programming languages, the default log function is log base 'e', so that is the log that I'm using here. If you want to use a different log, like log base 10, that's fine, just be consistent. NOTE 3: A lot of people ask if, once an observation is omitted from a bootstrap dataset, is it lost for good? The answer is ""no"". You just lose it for one stump. After that it goes back in the pool and can be selected for any of the other stumps. NOTE: 4: A lot of people ask ""Why is ""Heart Disease =No"" referred as ""Incorrect""""? This question is answered in the StatQuest on decision trees: https://youtu.be/_L39rN6gz7Y However, here's the short version: The leaves make classifications based on the majority of the samples that end up in them. So if most of the samples in a leaf did not have heart disease, all of the samples in the leaf are classified as not having heart disease, regardless of whether or not that is true. Thus, some of the classifications that a leaf makes are correct, and some are not correct.

I guess no, as we might loose much info, but if not how exactly missing samples are used. 2.

Afterwards I did not get what is exactly happening..  in new datasets, we have total 8 number of point out of which 4 are points which are incorrectly classified and you said we will go back to beginning and try to find stump that does best job classifying new collections of sample.   My concern is we are feeding wrong (incorrectly classified) point to other stump and how we this will improve our result? because you said for incorrectly classified points we will increase sample weight, and for correctly classified points we will decrease sample weight right? we are feeding incorrect points(4 incorrect out of 8) to stump.. This will increase weight RIGHT? next we will perform step of randomly choosing point (use perform 18.00 video length)  AGAIN number of incorrectly classified points will increase, again we will feed new data set(incorrect classified point) to other Stump... which will increase number of incorrect classified point...   In short I am little confused, how we will get best model by feeding incorrect point,where it is increasing sample weight for incorrect points and decreasing sample weight for correct points   Something I read on internet Boosting is a thing which improvise model based on previous error, which seems to be followed, but conceptually it is not clear to me.

@joerich10,2019-01-23T05:08:32Z,1,Another amazing video Josh! Can you please do a Statsquest on GBMs?,True
@LieutenantAwesom3,2019-01-21T13:51:34Z,2,Wait. How did you end up with 7/8? at 10:17? 1 - 3/8 is 5/8,True
@harshtripathi465,2019-01-21T10:58:02Z,2,"Hello Sir, I really love the simple ways in which you explain such difficult concepts. It would be really helpful to me and probably a lot of others if you could make a series on Deep Learning, i.e., neural networks, gradient descent etc. Thanks!",True
@LieutenantAwesom3,2019-01-21T09:07:41Z,1,I love you Josh,True
@rrrprogram8667,2019-01-20T11:00:41Z,1,Any plans to visit chennai ???? let me know ... would love to meet you ..,True

@ccuuttww,2019-01-17T08:43:14Z,0,lol this video is very detail however My learning schedule is fall behind :(  I don't have mush time to walk through this video deeply,True
@jonasvilks2506,2019-01-16T07:00:36Z,3,Hello. There is a little error in arithmetics. But AdaBoost is clearly explained! Error on 10:18: Amount of Say for Chest Pain = (1/2)*log((1-(3/8))/(3/8)) = 1/2*log(5/8/3/8) = 1/2*log(5/3) = 0.25 but not 0.42. I also join others in asking to talk about Gradient Boosting next time. Thank you.,True
@ericyang2475,2019-01-16T03:37:38Z,1,Very impressive. Can you talk about Gradient Boosting next time and its comparison with AdaBoost?,True
@yulinliu850,2019-01-16T00:18:24Z,1,"Another great video! Thanks a lot, Josh!",True
@demondaze100,2019-01-15T17:41:45Z,1,Thanks Josh! This helped a lot.,True

@rrrprogram8667,2019-01-15T04:54:09Z,1,Machine learning is easy..... only with STATQUEST....,True
@kohei4828,2019-01-15T03:51:46Z,1,"hi, another great video! I had a hard time understanding boosting algorithm but this made it so much clearer! I have a little question though, can we think of a GBDT(LightGBM, XGboost etc.) as an Adaboost using decision trees as weak learners instead of stumps?   Also, another video suggestion: Kernel PCA(or Kernel method in general) I know a lot of people have troubles understanding the concept of it including me...lol",True
@fgfanta,2019-01-15T02:27:26Z,1,"Thanks! What about gradient boosting? Is it used for genomics? I am aware that it has been successful used in Kaggle competitions, but don't find applications to genomics, in spite of the support of XGBoost and CatBoost for R.",True
@breakurbody,2019-01-15T02:20:36Z,2,"Thank you Statquest. Was eagerly waiting for Adaboost, Clearly Explained.",True
@kingrecession,2019-01-15T00:53:04Z,2,Haha you made the calculation noise yourself during the plug and chug :')),True
