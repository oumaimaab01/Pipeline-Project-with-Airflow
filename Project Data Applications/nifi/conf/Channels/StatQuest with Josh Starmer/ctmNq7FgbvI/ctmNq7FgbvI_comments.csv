I ´d like to answer how do you make the same in logistic and cox regression.

Each feature is a column in X, and each row is a person.  You are trying to predict if someone will commit fraud, so you put in these features (x.train) into a linear regression algorithm, with if those people actually did commit fraud (y.train).

@petax004,2019-03-21T15:04:04Z,1,Is the SME formula same for logistic regression?,True
@Fnottro,2019-03-11T19:17:01Z,0,This is amazing! Thank you for making these!,True
@lishanjiang260,2019-03-07T02:54:23Z,0,You just make it very clear and understandable. Thank you Josh!,True
@tanmaykorgaonkar963,2019-03-05T20:19:13Z,0,"Great Video.  Can you give a real life case study example like for linear regression to predict the amount spent by a customer on a e-commerce site or for logistic regression whether the person will default on loan payment, etc.",True
@pavannimaidas1008,2019-02-23T13:06:47Z,1,Can you share the same in Python?,True
@jordanmakesmaps,2019-02-23T02:49:16Z,20,Have you considered making a book that includes your explanations of concepts along with code examples? I really think it would make its way to the top along with ESL and ISLR. Thanks for your work!,True
@benjamin_markus,2019-02-21T19:52:23Z,1,I'm new to R and though I've looked I wasn't able to find the answer to this: how do I extract the fitted weights from the fit object?  also: I've performed this (with a slight modification: I did logistic regression by making the necessary changes according to the video) on my data but the MSE values do not change for different alphas at all - how to interpret this?,True
@baharehheydarzadeh6236,2019-01-30T17:02:34Z,1,You are simply the best !!!!,True

@user-bt2lc5wh7h,2018-10-29T08:55:03Z,2,"Could you please answer my question?If you want to use the obtained omics data such as protein/gene matrix to build a machine learning model, should you remove the correlated variables by Elastic-Net Regression or some methods like this?? Thank you a lot!",True
