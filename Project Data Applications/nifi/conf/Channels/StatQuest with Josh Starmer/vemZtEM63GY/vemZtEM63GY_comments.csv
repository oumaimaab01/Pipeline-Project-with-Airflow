@arenashawn772,2023-12-29T00:27:22Z,1,"I had a rather interesting policy discussion with a friend right before watching this video about p-value, about some tests being run to decide if certain public health measures should be put into place. The test for effectiveness for the said measures appear to be positive but the p value ended up being slightly higher than 0.05 and therefore ‚Äúbased on statistical knowledge‚Äù the measures to be carried out was rejected and never ended up being put into place.  After watching the last segments of your video, I feel the sadness of the decision being made largely based on scientific dogma instead of real scientific understanding‚Ä¶ Like you have pointed out, 0.05 is a chosen value not a golden standard. If little statistical random chance of the null hypothesis being true would lead to grave consequences, it should be lowered further. In the case for the said public health measure, it would bring significant benefits and the cost of carrying it out is not huge, so a slightly higher than 0.05 p-value should not have stood in the way of a possibly very true and positive effect had it been carried out‚Ä¶ Sigh.

So essentially it depends on what we formulate as our Null Hypothesis that defines if p value lower than or greater than threshold that determines false positive or is it always the case?

You might be good at explaining, but the explanation makes no sense to me. Could you shed some light for me please:  The excuses at regarding why a drug failed or worked, makes zero sense to me in a real world application. If you say ""oh maybe the drug works but was mislabelled"" or ""one drug is actually a placebo"" well then: In the real world experiment you would control all the variables and for example have made sure not to mislabel the item, and someone, even in a double blind study, would  know at some point whether it is a placebo or not.  No matter how many times you repeat something, all those excuses still stand and are possible and valid. Placebo power can be great and it is possible to find a large group of easily impressionable or gullible people for whom a placebo works for a large majority of. Similarly, if we are talking about unlikely events like ""Maybe the drug was mislabelled"", then if 1 pill was mislabelled then the entire batch of a million pills were also mislabelled, causing everyone who took it to have taken a mislabelled drug. So then you'd have 1 million people if each took 1 MISLABELLED pill, and were cured/not cured then your conclusion would still be wrong.",True

But I'm still confused (probably, because other sources are also so obtuse about these things). So, and tell me if I'm wrong, there's Type 1 and Type 2 errors with their probabilities (with Type 1 being a significance level Alpha, which we set ourselves, say, Alpha = 0.05). Then there is p-value, which shows a probability that if H0 is true this is a probability of getting this data set or more extreme one.  So, in the end, we have probability Alpha for Type 1 errors, probability Beta for Type 2 errors and p-value, which we calculate for the selected H0. And the reason we use Alpha as a threshold for p-value is only because of convenience, because we don't want to bother with selecting two distinct significance levels  In any case, thank you for the content!

This is not at all a criticism of your excellent effort, because if you tried to cover all considerations, you would never publish anything. This is what sank Charles Babbage.
