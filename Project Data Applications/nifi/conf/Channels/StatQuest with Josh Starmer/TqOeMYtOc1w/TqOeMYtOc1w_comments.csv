@yangtravis1182,2023-10-08T09:39:21Z,0,"One problem to discuss: In this video, you said the probability that the ""true"" mean is in this area has to be < 0.05. It was my definition of confidence interval before, but after some theoretical statistics courses, my definition has been refereshed. My statistics teacher told me that in this sentence, since neither the ""true"" mean nor that area is a random variable, this is in fact not a random event and give it a probability is logically wrong. However, the theoretically correct definition (i.e., after hundreds of repetition, 95% of 95% CIs will include the population mean) is usually not informative by itself for researchers, so the definition in the video got to be more popular in the end. I'm not sure whether you took all of it into consideration and then made that video, otherwise it may be better to review it if you remake this video in the future!

@ananyaagarwal7108,2022-09-13T19:38:51Z,0,"You are simply Awesome !! I have a doubt here though, Let's say the point estimate is the sample mean. We can repeatedly keep taking the sample means and then plot all these sample means in a histogram and we would observe a normal distribution called the sampling distribution of the sample means. The mean of this distribution would be a better estimate of the population mean and its standard deviation, called standard error would be the population standard deviation/sqrt (number of points in a sample). Won't the confidence interval(say 95%) range be (sampling distribution mean - 2  SE,sampling distribution mean + 2  SE) instead of (point estimate - 2  SE,point estimate + 2  SE)?  Why would we use the sample mean(point estimate) in calculating the confidence interval range? What if that particular sample mean was like an outlier in the sampling distribution of the mean? In that case, doing +/- 2*SE wouldn't be a good judge to measure population mean right?",True

@1tsvaishnav,2020-03-18T02:33:05Z,0,Can you give some intuition of prediction interval? What is the difference between confidence interval and prediction interval?,True
@stevequan7306,2020-03-02T11:17:08Z,0,"At 3:22 -- should the confidence interval bar has some constraints? (eg, should be the shortest bar to cover 95% means, otherwise I can shift and prolong it to cover 95% )",True
@emelyannett,2020-01-23T04:26:54Z,2,This is so helpful. Thank you,True
@sushilchauhan2586,2020-01-02T12:46:27Z,1,don't you think bootstrap is similar to central limit theorem?,True
@harithagayathri7185,2020-01-02T04:54:09Z,0,"Hi Josh, a little confused about the p-value here as, if less than 0.05 is considered as less likely to reoccur then why are we considering variables with less than 0.05 as highly significant variables in the regression models?",True
@xsli2876,2019-12-11T12:27:12Z,1,"Dir Sir: I really enjoy watching your videos. Thank you very much! I still have one question regards to 'confidence interval'. Let's say that based on the sample of 12 female mice, we have got the 95% confidence interval is:  200grams +/-  30 grams.  One interpretations is: any simple random sample of 12 female mice, its mean weight will be in the range of 170g to 230g, with 95% confidence. I guess if the sample size is 20 (female mice), I cannot say the sample mean will be in this range (170-->230g), with 95% confidence. Correct? (Because the sample size is not 12). Another question:   I also intend to say, any random female mouse, its weight will be in this range(170-->230g), with 95% confidence. I cannot say that, correct? Thank you!",True
@lilyha2470,2019-11-11T18:57:11Z,2,Why is it that nobody ever explained the CI to me like this before? I bet people who taught us statistic in med school knew this or they did not?,True
@joarvat,2019-11-05T20:20:00Z,167,"Guys, I can't believe you are doing all this.  I am trying to break into the field of data science, and your videos are really great because you are doing it in such an entertaining way.  Big thank you!",True
@martinkim5411,2019-09-02T06:30:05Z,0,StatQuest always makes me more confused.  Please add more examples for each case for clear understanding.,True

@Birdsneverfly,2019-05-22T07:22:04Z,1,Wonderful series.  Thankyou for sharing your knowledge.,True
@xnoreq,2019-04-19T16:06:52Z,1,Your example also shows how backwards confidence intervals and p-values are. You already assume a mean of ~26. But you end up calculating a p-value to make a probabilistic statement about the mean being lower than ~21 ... given samples from a distribution with a fixed mean of ~26.,True
@xnoreq,2019-04-19T15:55:53Z,14,"I'm sorry but your explanation is wrong. The confidence interval does not tell you how probable something lying inside our outside the interval is. Confidence intervals are a frequentist figure and therefore once you have a confidence interval, it either covers the mean or it doesn't. There's no probability involved anymore.  So a 95% confidence level does NOT mean that 95% of the sample data lies within the confidence interval. It also does NOT mean there is a 95% probability that new sample data will fall into the confidence interval. It also does NOT mean there is a 95% probability that the true mean will fall into the confidence interval. It's not even a definitive range of plausible values. In fact, large ranges of a confidence interval could be completely impossible.  The 95% and 5% are about the selection of the confidence interval (which is random), not about the data (which is fixed). So a 95% confidence level means that if hundreds of scientists repeated this experiment and calculated a 95% confidence interval, then on average 95% of those intervals would contain the population mean. 5% of the intervals would not.  So if you do your experiment and calculate a confidence interval you don't know if it contains the true mean or not.",True
@dharam8060,2019-03-23T08:44:39Z,1,How do we calculate 95% cover from the Bootstrap means?,True
@alexanderlewzey1102,2019-03-10T12:05:44Z,0,"i'm a little confused, is it true that if you use bootstrapping of a sample that will only tell you with what confidence you can state the mean of that particular sample? wouldnt you need to know the population standard deviation to get the confidence intervals for a sample from the population?",True
@ritika.upadhyay,2019-03-06T00:55:00Z,6,Hi Josh! Great videos (I'm currently on a StatQuest marathon and it has been incredibly helpful!) I have a question though. Could you explain the bit about p-value being less than 0.05 in case of the weights of female and male mice? Instinctively I understand that there's a statistical difference between the true means of these two but I'm struggling to relate it to the idea of p-value.   Thank you!,True
@matthewdong9368,2019-01-09T20:28:22Z,2,"In the example where you want to get the p-value for true mean less than 20, and the result is less than 0.05. Does that mean it's very unlikely that the true mean is less than 20? Thanks!",True
