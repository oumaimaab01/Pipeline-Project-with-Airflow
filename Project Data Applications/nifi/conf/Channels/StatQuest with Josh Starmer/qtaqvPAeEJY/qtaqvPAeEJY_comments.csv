If however, we measured the number of green and red apples from one particular grocery store, but on different days - then this would be coming from only two random variables, and we could calculate covariance.

Thank you for devoting so much time and effort to this. By the way, there seems to be a minor error in the calculation of covariance (the section between 7:30~12:00). The value of Y for two points (x = 24, y = 38) and (x = 29, y = 33) has apparently been replaced incorrectly. I think it should be modified as follows: Covariance = ( ( 3 - 17.6 ) √ó ( 12 - 24.4 ) + ( 13 - 17.6 ) √ó ( 10 - 24.4 ) + (19 - 17.6 ) √ó ( 29 - 24.4 ) + ( 24 - 17.6 ) √ó ( 38 - 24.4 ) + (29 - 17.6 ) √ó ( 33 - 24.4 ) ) / 4 = 438.8 / 4 = 109.7 If it is wrong, please correct me.

In a real statistics problem, would you really ever find a distribution such as this? If any of the data points were nudged even a little bit along the Y-axis, the covariance would cease to be zero, and the distribution would fall into one of the first two categories. Are there any cases where the covariance is zero like this example, and the data isn't just all on a horizontal/vertical line?",True

@sushilchauhan2586,2019-12-24T09:50:19Z,0,"so basically you want to calculate two data like height and weight irrexpective of there scale like ""cm"" to ""kg"" .... but relation wont change by changing the scale ... whether it is direct or indirect..... then why we want scale ?   i dont get it ... is there any use of scale ? i want to know slope of the +ve and -ve line and how far  point is from positive slope or vice versa ? but why we want it where we r gonna use it ? unlike mean and variance stdev etc we know it will be usefull to find 68 95 99 in normal distribution .. but here we dont know about scale and steep slope etc and there application",True

@Buri8128,2019-07-29T20:27:18Z,1,Would it not give more information if we made a linear regression between Gene X and Gene Y and looked at the beta value (slope ). That would not change if we change scale.  Also do you have a intuitive explaination why you divide by n-1 .  Great explaination of covariance however I know understand it on another level not just as a magic formula.,True
