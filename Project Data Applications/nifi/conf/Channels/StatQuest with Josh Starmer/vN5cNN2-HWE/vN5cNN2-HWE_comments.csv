It‚Äôs crucial to introduce that probabilistic reasoning at an early stage.

@robwasab,2021-11-10T22:40:44Z,0,"Hi, I thought your explanation of logistic regression using discrete variables was unclear.  I think you could've explained it without having to go into t-tests, and should've focused on drawing analogies between discrete and continuous logistic regression, since we just covered continuous, and it would've helped reinforce the concept. The final presentation of the discrete formula for probability was confusing, since you left it in linear form, this was compounded by declaring that the formula results in 'size', as in obesity, but the formula is actually computing log(odds of obesity), which is unit-less, and that you need to use the linear coefficients to arrive at the non-linear probability distribution. It would have been nice if you made it clear that the discrete logistic regression is just the continuous one with its input predictor held to 0 or 1. Pretty simple. This tells me that I can just recycle my continuous knowledge for discrete.  Another thing that you could've made clear is that odds is different from probability. And that odds is p / (1 - p).   Also, I would've liked if you finished the conversation on how to compute the actual probability distribution once we've found the linear regression coefficients for both continuous and discrete cases.

Two parts are p<1/2 + p>1/2 2. odds-log(odds): y = log(odds) this is a normal log function where odds belongs to [0,inf) and log(odds) belongs to (-inf,+inf). Corresponding two parts are 0<odds<1 + odds>=1 3. (3=1+2) p-log(odds): y= log(odds) = log(p/1/p). This is the famous logit function where p belongs to [0,1] and log(odds) belongs to (-inf,+inf). Corresponding two parts are p<1/2 + p>1/2 4. (inverse 3) x-p: p = 1/(1+(e^(-z)). This is the famous sigmoid function and it is the inverse of 3rd relationship, where z=ax+b or x belongs to (-inf,+inf) and p belongs to [0,1]. Corresponding two parts are z<-log2 + z>-log2 5.
