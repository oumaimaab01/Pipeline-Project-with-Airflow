It is not a model equation, so can not be used for predictions... what am I missing? 2) another thing confuses me is that here ,at least in ghe shoesize example you use the chainrool to get the final model.

@georgetzimas6882,2021-07-16T02:45:07Z,3,"13:15 Is the residual(squared) graph mirrored? Since residual=(observed - predicted), wouldn't that mean that when on the original graph the intercept is zero, the residual would be positive(2-1=1), so the position on the residual(squared) graph should be on the positive x-axis(x=1), as opposed to the negative side on the video, and vice versa?",True
