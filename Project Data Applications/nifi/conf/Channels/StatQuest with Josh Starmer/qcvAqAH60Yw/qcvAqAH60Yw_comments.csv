@songuihamedkone6600,2019-10-19T13:38:23Z,1,Thanks a lot !,True
@mzw90,2019-10-06T04:34:15Z,0,Thank you for the video. It was very easy to follow. May I know how do i obtain optimal cut off points using the ROC curve?,True
@jarednesvet2826,2019-09-17T18:10:28Z,1,So do these thresholds correlate to the probabilities that are used to separate the obese vs. not obese? Is there a way to figure out how to convert the thresholds back to the actual weights themselves that are used as the cutoff?,True
@Ryutora8,2019-09-04T21:54:51Z,0,I Have a problem with this. The ifelse function is giving me a different value each time i run it. ¿Do you have a clue why is this happening?,True
@diegoangulo3724,2019-09-02T17:32:22Z,0,"is it possible to print the cutoffs at seq(0.1, by=0.1) in this curve with roc() function?   ...Awesome videos btw!!!!!!!!",True

@tynna333,2019-07-14T22:09:07Z,0,Is there anyway to suppress plotting the top and right axes? I tried bty='n' and axes=FALSE to add them later using axis(1) and axis(2) but neither of those worked.,True

@nabilmahmoud608,2019-06-07T14:18:33Z,1,This video is absolutely amazing! but how can i determine the threshold/cut off weight from threshold probability that decides whether the subject is obese or not using code and not by direct extrapolation from the logit curve?,True
@jeanmarysymon3596,2019-06-05T15:34:16Z,4,could you do the same in python too?,True
