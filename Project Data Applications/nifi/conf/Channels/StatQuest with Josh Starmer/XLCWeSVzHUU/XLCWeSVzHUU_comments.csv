@amnont8724,2023-05-02T21:35:17Z,0,"2:49 - Hey Josh, given that the distribution is the same, why is the P-Value high if we take a few different samples? Aren't the samples sort of related because they belong to the same distribution?",True
@shahjahanbd2000,2023-03-27T05:29:46Z,1,I like your examples and explantions! Easy to understand complex concepts!,True

@ThomasHaberkorn,2023-03-06T10:53:00Z,3,"I just bought 'The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning' and I'm loving it. Wonder if you would also do a book about the  'Statistics Fundamentals'.. would love it too",True
@carzetonao,2023-02-18T21:14:41Z,1,"Why my high school teachers and university professor can not teach it in this way.i think probably they both are confusing for what they are saying, so they chose to read all concepts from textbook.",True

@lion87563,2022-12-10T11:28:18Z,0,"As far as I understand, sampling from a distribution versus sampling in signal processing is this:  Instead of sampling a y based on x, we now sample x based on y.",True

@Oscar-jg9gg,2022-10-12T16:22:40Z,0,"@ 2:27, what are statistical tests? Also, is the reality distribution sampling and our expectation the statistical distribution?",True
@shekharspeaks129,2022-10-11T03:29:13Z,1,"AT 2:51, you said ""since the distribution is same, T-test should be give a large p-value."" I do not understand this point.",True
@letsjoinhands,2022-06-26T18:39:29Z,1,So in summary random samples are taken from statistical distributions to perform statistical tests on the sample data in order to compare our expectations (of the results of those tests) with the actual results of those tests that could be different from our expectations (based on some already known facts about the original distribution from which those samples were taken). Is that right?,True
@Keke-xp1ee,2022-06-06T02:17:00Z,1,Why an I seeing about p test before learning about p test in the playlist. Please make an ordered playlist,True

It could help a direct import to OneNote so that we can then make notes on the slides.. thanks in advance for considering",True
@pdkovacs,2019-12-15T08:42:11Z,2,"Does ""taking a sample from a distribution"" as opposed to ""taking a sample from the population"" mean that you take a sample from a sample?",True

@dorindragos,2019-09-08T19:23:46Z,0,May one use a t-test on such small samples (3-strong each)? Shouldn't one use smth like a Mann-Whitney test?,True
@saratkumarp2906,2019-07-15T18:58:40Z,1,Do we have to increase the sample size each time and calculate mean for each sample size ? In tat case mean of the sample sizes will form a normal curve irrespective of the type of curve of the original population  Am i right?,True
@Dataforliving,2019-04-23T02:42:42Z,56,"I appreciate the effort to simplify and will always give thumbs up when the concept is crystal-clearly explained. Otherwise, I'd rather request to explain what it means to ""do a test on a sample"" and why is a large p-value expected. There seems to be a disconnect between one condition and its effect as stated here. I appreciate all your other videos though! May I suggest a real-world example (like the ones to which you resort in most of your other videos)",True
@joaoostrowski,2019-04-19T11:14:57Z,16,"I recently found about Stat Quest channel and I fell in love with the videos, watching everything from the basics. For this video, though I wanted to give feedback, too many new concepts were introduced for trying to give a broader explanation of sampling distributions. I'm confident with my AP studies but I got a bit confused with the video, Maybe if the focus were on sampling distributions for estimating a statistic that we don't have from the population it would've been more clear. This is at least the strategy followed by Khan Academy when introducing this part for their AP.",True
@mkilptrick,2019-03-24T20:44:33Z,48,What is meant by p-value? t-test?,True
@ywang4781,2019-02-10T21:34:02Z,2,These are such awesome and helpful videos! I feel so much more interview ready. Thank you so much! :D,True
@nitin.cherian,2018-12-13T02:16:16Z,7,"Josh, what is p value as mentioned in this video ? Is there a video on that ?",True
@rrrprogram8667,2018-04-30T16:57:10Z,2,Nice... Thanks foe the video,True
@geralddevera,2018-04-30T15:13:54Z,5,Thank you very much Sir for this recommendation! Thank you for always singing prior starting the discussion! It helps students like me to be motivated!  :D,True
