@nishant8507,2023-08-05T12:18:03Z,1,Hi Statquest. Love your content. Been following for some time. I was looking at entering the Data Science and ML field?? SHould i learn how to do hyperparameter optimization or just learn Auto ML for doing it?? Your response will be much appreciated.,True
@lolikpof,2023-05-31T11:54:32Z,1,this sounds scary for someone studying data science..,True
@RollingcoleW,2023-02-02T02:04:29Z,1,Great episode and song! lol,True
@after1001,2022-07-05T14:48:11Z,0,Excel isn't $1200 per month,True
@murilopalomosebilla2999,2021-09-04T22:45:48Z,9,Really hope to see AutoML become more popular. Too many people wasting time doing things like hyperparameter optimization or such when there are much more important things to look at.,True
@ISK_VAGR,2021-07-13T16:33:34Z,1,"Josh, it is a pleasure to see your videos. I was not able to support your Patreon because they don't like my credit card, but at least I want to use JADBIO. My company can get good use of it. In addition, I am learning tones with your explanations. Thanks.",True
@sharan9993,2021-06-06T23:53:34Z,0,12:40 he says data scientists should provide more to justify the salary. can u explain what those skills might be?,True
@ran_domness,2021-03-28T12:36:28Z,1,"Love Crete!....now  Love Auto ML!  Thanks Josh , very interesting.",True
@anothervanwinkle,2020-10-27T06:57:53Z,0,"Well, amazing and slightly frightening perspective at the same time. But as I. Tsamardinos pointed out, the role of human data scientist will shift focus to data preparation and outcome evaluation, as it should be. The image of sci-fi genuses fostering their artificial ""child"" (HAL or Mr. Data) comes to mind. For this to work instantly I see an obstacle in the computational power needed for ML processes. Furthermore, prediction is only part of the story, to be exaxt, the second part. Knowing what constitutes a model is implicit in any scientific field aiming at explaining the world and it gains importance where model based decisions have severe consequences for individuals' lives, e.g. bank lending or forensic risk assessment. But yeah, having AutoML would leave more time for other nice things in life, too. Looking forward to seeing how the story evolves.",True
@pankajmodi8009,2020-10-20T00:40:01Z,0,do we have to follow the ML tutorials..?,True
@rmfalcao,2020-10-10T08:01:28Z,0,"Hi! Thanks for creating and maintaining such a useful channel! Multiple BAM's! :) I looked for videos that clearly explain Apriori and Ripper, but couldn't find them... Did you create those? YouTube is full of examples... but no one else does it like you do.

@StratosFair,2020-10-05T12:09:40Z,0,"Hey Josh, thank you so much for all these videos on your channel ! They saved my life more than once !  As a suggestion, I think you should consider making a video about Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, it's a quite nice and efficient method, but I remember struggling so much with it back then !",True
@puzzlecollector9518,2020-10-02T14:44:11Z,1,awesome video! thanks :),True

@dheerajkura5914,2020-09-09T04:28:53Z,1,"Building a Machine Learning model involves lot of analysis , discussion and decision making while treating the data, choosing ML algorithm, inferencing ML model results ... Any automation can make faster ML model building by scalable infra / any other way   But the irony is building a ML model is next best priority after understanding business problem, sourcing right data and treating the data as well",True
@chloeh7119,2020-09-08T00:25:48Z,2,Like  before  watching the video,True
,2020-09-07T22:35:28Z,1,AutoML is what i suggest the future... like automation always is. like things we use today and think we have to do many stuff manually ... in fact... people earlier called building up the basis for that:  automation,True

@thirtysixnanoseconds1086,2020-09-07T08:00:36Z,4,"I see this as the ode45 of machine learning - incredibly powerful but issues surrounding understanding of underlying system, instability etc. I don't think it's good to have people using tools they don't understand. Machine learning models for the most part are black boxes, interpretability techniques such as LIME/SHAP are not a substitute for model understanding - feature importance of an instance isn't an understanding. We already see this kind of sausage machine, handle cranking mentality in professionals in electronics with circuit simulation etc, the more trust we put in a system we don't ourselves understand, the more we use tools unknown to us - the more dangerous they are",True
