@basharabdulrazeq4349,2024-05-22T17:29:42Z,0,"Hello Josh. @ 7:57, you explained that if there are fewer samples than variables then the number of samples puts an upper bound on the number of PCs. In the last example, there are 3 samples and 3 variables (therefore the number of samples isn't fewer than the number of variables), and the number of PCs should be 3 (not 2). could you explain why did you decide that the number of PCs should be 2!!. (BTW I watched all of your videos about PCA, but I don't understand this specific example).",True

@samggfr,2023-01-15T18:24:56Z,1,"Hi Josh. Thanks for your videos, especially when you are diving into details and tips. In tip#2 concerning centering, you show 2 sets of 3 points and you present the centering to the mean. Let's imagine an experiment with 3 patients with drug A and 3 patients with drugs A and B. Let's say the lower/left set if the reference, drug A, and the upper/right set is the test, drug A+B. What about centering on A (set A will be at the origin)? This centering should show the total effect of adding drug B to drug A, whereas the mean centering shows half the effect. In the same vein, the variables plot should show the variables that change from drugA set to drugAB set instead of showing variables that change from the mean experiment ie ((drugA+drugAB)/2).

@paulotarso4483,2021-01-31T20:10:40Z,1,"Hey Josh thx so much for your videos... 3 quick questions:  1. 7:54 says ""if there are fewer samples than variables, the number of samples puts an upper bound on the number of PCs with eigenvalues greater than 0"", but in the example there, the number of samples is equal to the number of variables, not less. Should the statement be ""if # of samples <= variables (...)"" then the upper bound applies?  2. In the same section above, there are only 2 PCs for 3 samples. From the initial prediction it seems like there could only be 2 PCs since 3 points make a plane. Could there be 3 PCs for 3 samples, or is the sample upper bound always # of samples - 1?  3. To clarify, 7:05 says ""since we only have 2 points we only have 1 PC"" so I can have a single PC with a slope in a much higher dimension? Since this PC would be in R3, that's okay, correct",True

What if we have just one person weighting above 100 Kg and his weight is 160Kg; If we drop only this sample from the Data, the scale and whole PCAs will differ significantly.

@survivio8937,2020-04-02T12:10:25Z,0,"Thank you so much for these amazing videos. With my new found free time, I am trying to learn about PCA in preparation for upcoming RNA-seq experiments.  I have yet to do this and will probably understand more once I have practical experience, but one thing struck me as odd in your video. When scaling data, you state that the typical method of doing this is to divide by the standard deviation assuming large values will have larger SD.  But, intuitively it would make sense to scale data based on the mean rather than the SD. For example if I had one gene which is highly expressed but not variable, then it would not be scaled down appropriately and would have an oversized contribution to PC1. Am I thinking about this wrong or is there some reason what mean is a bad choice? Next, it seems that with scaling, small changes in rare transcripts (that might just be error and not true transcripts) would contribute a lot to the variability and thus PC1; does this not present a problem?    Also, another comment: I find this and the prior video on PCA from 2018 much more intuitive than the one you produced previously in which you discuss generating a PC axis by looking at the spread of data for 2 cells with multiple transcripts and coming up with  weights or ""loading scores"" for each trancript based on high and low expression.
