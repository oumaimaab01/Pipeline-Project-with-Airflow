@statquest,2020-04-08T18:58:03Z,15,"Correction: 9:28 I have log(reads for gene X) - log(average for gene X), but it should be: log(reads for gene X) - average(log values for gene for gene X). We are subtracting the geometric mean from each gene measurement. In other words, if you take 'the average of reads' to be the geometric average, it all hangs neatly together.

@sunnetinternationalbusines9910,2022-07-09T11:24:43Z,0,"So if log takes away our differential counts, how do we know differential genes amongst two different samples. for us developmental scientists, we always like to see which gene is uniquely responsible for one character and hoe to confirm it by tracing it in the laboratory with knockouts and knockings. Its like DESEQ2 defeats that. And I have been using it for my data analysis from time.",True

@bzaruk,2022-04-03T19:25:50Z,0,how would you do a differential expression between multiple cell lines? do them in pairs and then find the shared highly differentially expressed genes? or is there a way of doing it in one analysis?,True
@nishantshade668,2021-12-10T13:09:29Z,0,"The scaling factor which you mentioned at 4:46, is it the same as the work done by the 'Estimate Size Factor' function in R programming??",True
@lycz9869,2021-11-23T15:31:06Z,0,Around 12:20 you say that the idea of logs and median is to look at house keeping genes and to eliminate all genes which are only transcribed in one sample. But why should we do this? If we knock out a transcription factor to find its function this is exactly what we are interested in. Or does this method serve a different purpose?  Thank you!,True
@Reonsi,2021-10-15T14:28:57Z,0,"As a summary, I would say that the geometric average downplays the effect of outliers at the gene level (rows), while the median downplays outliers at the sample level (column). The subtraction allows us to rank samples by sequencing depth, and the division applies the scaling factor to our original data.",True
@leixiao169,2021-10-14T05:38:53Z,0,"Thanks for the really helpful video! If DEseq2 removes genes that have 0 reads,  does this affect results interpretation? For example, different tissues express different genes (in some tissues the expression of certain genes is 0), for some ""0"" expression genes in certain tissues,  the difference between these tissues and the tissues in which these genes are highly expressed is physiologically relevant.  I hope the program still keeps these ""0"" read genes.",True

@user-ts1dm8ht5d,2021-09-06T03:36:14Z,1,"DESeq2 Library Normalization 步驟: 1. 先對每一個樣本的每一個基因的read值取自然對數。 2. 計算所有樣本中每一個基因 read log 值的平均。 3. 把平均數為正負無限大的基因組去除。 4. 計算每一個基因 read log 值與其 read log 平均數的偏差。(以每一筆資料減去平均數) 5. 計算所有基因中每一個樣本偏差的中位數。 6. 將每個中位數取指數還原(以e為底)，所求即為每個樣本read的scaling factor。 7. 把每一筆基因read值各自乘上該樣本對應的 scaling factor ，即完成基因庫標準化。  DESeq2 Library Normalization steps: 1. First, take the natural logarithm of the read value of each gene in each sample. 2. Calculate the average of the read log value of each gene in all samples. 3. Remove genomes whose average is positive or negative infinity. 4. Calculate the deviation of the read log value of each gene from its average read log. (Subtract the average from each data) 5. Calculate the median of the deviation of each sample in all genes. 6. Take the exponential reduction for each median (using e as the base), and what you find is the scaling factor of each sample read. 7. Multiply each gene read value by the scaling factor corresponding to the sample to complete the Library Normalization.  I did this summery just help me quickly recall the DESeq2 methods, because I'm a Master student and learning DESeq2 now. So if there're some errors, please help me correct it. Thanks everyone!

@bzaruk,2021-02-18T22:47:45Z,0,"First of all - I LOVE your stuff! so helpful and clear! quick question though - I have an RNA-Seq of some experiments for 4 different cell-lines, each cell line has 3 biological replicates with 3 technical replicates each - I want to do some normalization on that RNA-Seq results to compare between the cell lines. You mentioned in the video that DESeq wasn't meant to do normalization between different reads count but between different cells - which is exactly what I am doing - BUT - I do have some delta between the reads of each technical replicate, especially between the 1st biological replicate against both the 2nd and the 3rd biological replicates due to different PCR cycles. My question is - do I need to perform any kind of normalization based on the reads before I do the DESeq normalization?",True

@CaveCrack,2020-09-23T19:49:17Z,0,"Josh, thanks for your wonderful series of videos. I have a question about using the DESeq2 normalization method on TPM data. I have TPM from RSEM output, each sample of course sums to 1 million. It seems that using DESeq2 style normalization on this TPM data would be valuable as it will adjust for library composition. I am not using R, so I'm not using the DESEq2 bioconductor package, just computing the normalization as you describe. Documentation on the DESeq2 package says the counts should be raw counts, however it seems that TPM would be just as valid if normalization is the only step of interest. Is this correct? thanks",True
@Moominverdatre,2020-09-07T20:13:50Z,0,"Thanks for the great video. What you call ""scaling factor"" is the output of the function estimateSizeFactors, right? The name is a little bit misleading for someone who's already very confused with all the different normalisation methods!",True

@zuhaibahmed6817,2020-05-01T21:23:47Z,2,"Thanks for you videos! They really are a huge help. I just have a question about your explanation for differences in library composition at 3:41. I'm not sure I follow. The way I see it, if those 563 reads don't map to A2M, they aren't going to just move onto other genes to inflate their counts. So the only reason that the other genes in library 2 have higher counts is because they had more reads that matched their sequence, indicating that their transcripts were more abundant. Which would mean those other genes are differentially expressed as well, right? If only A2M was differentially expressed, then those other genes would retain their small counts because they aren't transcribed any more than in library 1. Am I misunderstanding something? Thanks   Edit: I have two other questions as well, if you don't mind: 1) Does this method of normalization take into account the lengths of the different transcripts like TPM/RPKM/FPKM?  2) Is this method more robust than TPM/RPKM/FPKM? If so, then should it be used in instead of them?   Sorry for the onslaught of questions. Thanks for the help!",True
@michelepierotti2833,2020-04-08T16:40:19Z,2,"Average of logs is not the same as log of averages! Around 9:19 you are saying log(reads for geneX) - log(average for geneX) = log of the ratio, correctly. But what you calculated in step 2 is not the log(average for gene X) but the average of the log(reads). If a, b, c were the read counts for the 3 samples for say GENE3, the average you calculated in the example step 2 is (loga +logb + logc)/3. This, in your example is Average of log reads. But when you go on to discuss the logratio you are treating it as the log(average), the log of [ (a+b+c)/3], i.e. the log of the average. These 2 quantities are not the same thing obviously, So either you are wrong in the example at step 2 or you are wrong later when you treat it as a log(average) while you had calculated the average of logs. Could you help clarify and ideally correct the example in the video?",True
