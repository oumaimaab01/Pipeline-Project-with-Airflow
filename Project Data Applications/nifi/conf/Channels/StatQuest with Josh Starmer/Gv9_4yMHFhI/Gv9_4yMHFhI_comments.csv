I break my head everyday looking for a way to teach myself all that is there to the field. MIT lectures, youtube videos, udemy course and all that. I have to admit that a majority of videos are very very rhetoric (even the courses on Udemy). Your videos clearly show that you not only explain the necessary foundation concepts but you are also very closely aware about the whole superficial perception of the field (pretty evident at 8:23 lol).  All I have to say is that I am very thankful for insightful videos. It is a great time in human history when education and information is reaching to masses for free. But I believe there is a responsibility that rest with the people who benefit from all these free content; a strive to improve things. Hence, I will chalk down a few struggles, questions and challenges that I face or have faced in my journey of learning, so that you may create videos around it and not just help me but anyone who is trying to learn this domain; given the fact that it is so full of hyped noise.",True
