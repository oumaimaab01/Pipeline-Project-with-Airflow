@pamaa7,2024-03-13T17:02:43Z,1,Thank you so much for explaining a student who got low marks in Statistics I'm feeling happy that my concepts are clear now. Can't thank you enough.,True
@joshstat8114,2024-02-25T00:17:11Z,0,Clearly explained. I have something to request. Would you like to create a video about law of large numbers and order statistics?,True
@karthica5251,2023-12-21T03:25:43Z,0,"Amazing as always, but here when you mention correlation are you referring to pearson correlation coeff? Is it possible for them to be non-linearly correlated (I cannot think of a situation)?",True
@chaduvulachilakala7981,2023-05-15T03:50:15Z,1,great explanation sir thank you,True

@ehsansalehabadi1500,2022-08-10T11:31:07Z,2,"Thanks for these awesome sets of lectures, sir.  I had a question. does the formula work only for positive correlations? I mean what if the correlation between twins is negative so that they zeroed the denominator, or for example, make the effective size negative?",True
@xanyula2738,2022-08-02T09:01:44Z,0,Is effect size and effective sample size the same thing ?,True
@fatemehkarimi6752,2022-06-07T19:50:01Z,2,"dear Josh, I will be thankful if you make a video about the effect size and cohen's d. these topics are intangible and I didn't find a good video for them on the net. thanks in advance.",True

@PGDM_SHASHANKJAIN,2020-06-25T07:40:12Z,0,"Hi, Here you calculated the effective sample size for persons belonging to the same set of population( blue ones),  However there must be some correlation between the orange and blue ones or blue and green ones or orange and green ones or among all three of them .Aren't we supposed to calculate effective sample size for them too?",True
@user-bz8nm6eb6g,2020-05-12T01:54:39Z,2,what a clear explanation,True

@ciherrera,2020-01-29T08:26:45Z,0,"I have a couple questions about this video. Is there an explanation for the effective sample size equation you show? Also, why would the effective sample size equation not be linear with correlation? If you have a sample size of 2, and a correlation of 0.5, why would the effective sample size be 1.33 and not 1.5?",True
@nanazeethiopia2892,2019-12-28T00:34:07Z,1,"BAM!! I Really like your lectures . They are super professional. Can you do on LSTM , Long range dependence, and other types of distributions like Pareto Distributions ....??.  Thanks.",True

@reytns1,2017-10-24T09:51:34Z,0,"Hello, Joshua, I have an experiment on an F1 mapping population, I work with table grape, so I take 36 individuals of my population to measurement firmness 18 have a good firmness and the other not, actually are the bad ones.... so as you mentioned in this video do I have to apply an effective sample size? (Is it possible that you give your email?) thanks",True
@mastermike890,2017-10-23T23:25:47Z,2,"Such a great series! Really helps make statistics approachable to us! I can't wait for a Central limit therm, delta method, strong law of large numbers or perhaps slutsky's theorem.  Those are all topics which I found really challenging when I first started my studies.",True
