@rjain3443,2019-01-18T13:47:40Z,1,"Thanks a lot for your video, it's awesome..!!!!  I have some doubts, I would be thankful to you if you can clarify it.  - In the maximum likelihood approach, we are finding the best estimate of the parameter assuming a distribution, by observing the data points, so in that case, we are estimating the parameter after observing data.  So, is it not same as the posterior probability, where we update the prior after observing the data?  -Also, what it means when it is said that in this approach, the error bars for the estimate are obtained by considering the distribution of possible data sets?  Thanks !!",True
