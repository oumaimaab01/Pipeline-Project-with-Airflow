Similarly, what would the consequent probabilities or likelihoods for loves soda given doesn't love candy, and doesn't love soda given doesn't love candy, need to be such that in a world where loves candy given doesn't love soda and doesn't love candy given doesn't love soda, that both these posterior probabilities are equally likely? In other words, we‚Äôd be indifferent? The likelihood of loves soda given doesn't love candy would need to be 50.00% (1.00x or 100 for every 200), and doesn't love soda given doesn't love candy would need to be 50.00% (1.00x or 100 for every 200), all else being equal.  Using the Wald test, the relationship or association between loves candy or doesn't love candy and loves soda is statistically significant (n=10,000). Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.30, p < .001, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.28, 0.33]. We can say the same between love candy or doesn't love candy and doesn't love soda. OR = 3.33, p < .001, 95% CI [3.07, 3.62].",True
