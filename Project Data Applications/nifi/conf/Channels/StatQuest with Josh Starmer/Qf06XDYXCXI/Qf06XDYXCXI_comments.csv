@vishnumuralidharan9858,2024-02-11T03:56:57Z,1,"Hi Josh, I just want to say that you are an absolutel godsend to the ML and DS community. I have been following your content since 2020 and you have never let me down. I hit a block with PyTorch code implementation and your videos simply untangled a lot of my mental knots. Keep up the great work!",True
@drintro,2024-02-02T18:16:19Z,3,The best part of this example is the way the first example is written with single dimension arrays for all of the parameter values. That makes the matrix operations explicit and more clear even to an experienced developer. I recommend writing and debugging the code from watching the video. There are small things that you might get wrong that will teach you something.,True
@exxzxxe,2024-02-01T20:06:50Z,1,Josh- you are a Master in making the difficult comprehensible!,True
@tom19860526,2024-01-22T04:12:01Z,1,I like your videos. Both the slides and explanations are very detailed and clear. I cherish them every time I watch them. It is a good learning video. thank you very much.,True

@user-xl9lj2qo4r,2023-12-18T23:31:19Z,0,"Hi josh Starmer, after learning ML, whether this series is enough for a s beginner to learn deep learning? and do any additional things to know other than this series for deep learning?",True
@yashsonune4391,2023-12-07T05:03:20Z,0,Thank you again for the quality content. üî•. Btw is there any plans for teaching about fine-tuning Language models. I heard this paper (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification) is of higher  relevance and backbone for many state of the art solutions.,True

@gsestream,2023-11-18T20:48:52Z,0,"as a related thing, finding closest things on a map/grid, without making a cell division system, sort all dimensions then check if they collide, like spheres or aabb bounding boxes, n log n time complexity, as opposed to n^2 time complexity, similar to grid cell partitioning of data, for clustering, or k-nearest clustering, but just finds closest at range, any number, very fast. should be applicable directly in high dimensionality complex data analysis, dimensionality reduction, covariance matrices, yep its designed to be fast",True

@d_b_,2023-11-07T18:52:30Z,0,"üëçSo, these are word embeddings. Do you know/think that sentence embeddings and text embeddings differ much from this process?",True
@RaynerGS,2023-11-07T14:55:39Z,0,"The original work [1] uses a multidimensional vector for each word instead of a unique real value. For instance, Troll2 = [,025, 0,735, 0,256, 0,145], in this case, four dimensionality. In the paper, the authors use a matrix instead of a neuron. Question: using neurons, how would you increase the word dimensionality representation?  1: ""Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, and Jeffrey Dean.
