@prithvidhyani1991,2024-03-27T13:02:14Z,0,"Great video overall! But I'm a little confused with your description of calculating a p-value for the R^2. Does this mean we are treating R^2 as a random variable itself and looking at its distribution? Because to me it seems like it is the f-statistic that follows an f-distribution, hence we are calculating a p-value for the f-stat, not the R^2 itself, which(correct me if I'm wrong) does not follow any specific distribution. So what exactly is the connection between the R^2 and the f-stat and its corresponding p-value?",True

@johnlemon1595,2023-08-21T13:14:01Z,1,"Hi josh, while getting to R^2, you give the formula y= (data-mean)^2. This contradicts your StatQuest ""Fitting a line to the data"", where your formula was ""(b-y1)^2+(b-y2)^2+..."", meaning ""(intersect-data)^2. Now i already understood that by squaring the difference you get the same positive value, so the order doesn't matter for this purpose. Is there another reason why you put it in the order ""(data-mean)^2"" in this video? Thanks. Love the videos, just watching for fun",True

@VirtuosicBeats,2023-04-18T18:28:40Z,0,"Awesome, but can we do this without squaring? Why can't we just sum the residuals without any squaring, it looks like it should give us the sum of all distances and then we could plot it in the same way and pick the rotation that gives us the least sum of non-squared residuals and it should still work, curious why do we choose to square it, thank you so much for the video <3",True
@user-cr6zu5mm5j,2023-04-08T05:14:51Z,0,I don't understand why least squares can cause any term that will make ss(fit) worse to be multiplied by 0. Is it because mean squares differential the equation? 15:20,True
