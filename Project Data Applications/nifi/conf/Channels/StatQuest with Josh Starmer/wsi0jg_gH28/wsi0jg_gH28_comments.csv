@halkerable,2024-05-26T10:39:38Z,0,"Thank you Josh - these videos are so helpful.  Is there a statistical test for this question: ""is the slope coefficient of a linear regression model equal to 1?"" The context is for a quantitative test, comparing it to a series of analytes of known quantity.   I'd like to know if the test has a bias, e.g. it over-quantitates higher concentrations (or under-quantitates lower concentration samples) Thanks again",True
@shamilmowlana8849,2024-04-21T13:57:08Z,0,"Nice video. What do you think about checking the model by verifying the assumptions for residuals. I.e, normality, independence, zero mean and constant variance",True
