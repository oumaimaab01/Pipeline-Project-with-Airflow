I understand the exploding gradient problem but in case of vanishing gradient the gradient is very small only for the input1 part of the whole gradient update for W2. but for the input values close to the end they should contribute to the gradient significantly. so am i missing something or getting something wrong or when we say vanishing gradient is a problem in RNNs that's simply because we are saying that our model is majorly focused on only last few values and would not pay much attention to starting or values far away from the end because gradient can't reach till that point for them to affect the model weights. can you please explain this to me.,True

@sheelstera,2024-01-03T21:23:17Z,0,Hi @statquest ..I have seen this video and other rnn explanations as well hoping somewhere to get a legitimate explanation to my following question: if the idea of the feedback loop is merely to retain previous information so that the subsequent cycle is more informed when making a prediction then at 7:21 why couldn't w2 simply be 1..why does it have to be anything other than 1? Why are we diminishing or exploding the previous output by multiplying by w2 (instead of retaining it in it's pure form) and thereby inviting problems like gradient vanishing or exploding? Keeping w2 at 1 will retain ALL past history plus bypass gradient vanishing/exploding problems. What am I undermining/missing/overlooking? Or I would go so far as to say why is a mutated form of input(t-1) i.e. y1*w2 being fed into the next cycle with input(t) instead of input(t-1) in it's pure form since the original intention is to retain the information?,True
@shofiyabootwala2094,2023-12-24T23:20:47Z,0,the vanishing/exploding gradient problem is synonymous to choosing a right value for alpha (learning rate) as choosing a greater value would leave us bouncing and choosing a lower value would lead to more iterations of gradient descent,True

@harshshah3797,2023-07-26T10:48:06Z,1,"Summary  Problem with regular neural network It takes fixed length of input.  Here comes RNN to help. It can take variable length of input.  How RNN is made? Input + Previous Output == Output  Why RNN is not popular? As it has one problem call Vanishing / Exploding Gradient Problem. As we have long chains,it is natural to this problem will arise. Lets say we have weight that multiplies with previous output greater than 1. As we have long chain,we will be multiplying many times numbers will become large. (Output will very too much) If we have less than 1 it will become very small. (Output will not change at all)  Here is an analogy that might help you understand the Vanishing / Exploding Gradient Problem:  Imagine that you are trying to find your way through a forest. You have a map, but the map is very old and the trails are not marked very well. As you walk through the forest, you make a lot of small decisions about which way to turn. These decisions are based on the gradients of the map.  If the gradients are very large, you might make a big turn and end up very far away from your destination. If the gradients are very small, you might make a small turn and not make much progress.  The Vanishing / Exploding Gradient Problem is like having a map with very large or very small gradients. In this case, it would be very difficult to find your way through the forest.",True

But can we extend this explanation for exploding gradient to the case when we use Sigmoid or tanH as the activation. In that case we wont be able to say that the input1 gets multiplied by  {w2}^T (assuming T is the number of times the RNN is unrolled),True
