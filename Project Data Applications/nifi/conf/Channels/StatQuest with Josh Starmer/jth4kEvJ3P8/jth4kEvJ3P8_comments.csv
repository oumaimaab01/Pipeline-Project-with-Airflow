@mariapelaez3758,2023-09-18T21:02:19Z,0,"Hi Josh,  I saw both of your videos for UMAP, but I have a doubt regarding how you did the low-dimension graph. I knw you mention spectral embedding an what I know from that is that you calculate the Laplacian of the graph and then get the eigenvalues and eigenvector and the coordinates of the new dimension will be the values of the eigenvector for the lowest eigenvalue (ignoring zero eigenvalues). But, when I try that for your data, I am not able to get the values that you showed, so, I wanted to know if you did something different.  Also I wanted to know if for more than 1 dimension, I will use more than 1 eigenvector right? For the 2d case the x-y coordinates will be the values of the first and second eigenvectors of the lowest eigenvalues.  Thanks",True
@harryhamjaya,2023-09-18T01:12:34Z,0,"Hello could you bring Spectral Embedding topic, and I have a question regarding UMAP how is it possible that UMAP is faster than T-SNE, in which part does it beat the t-sne? Since logically T-SNE moves more point in a time compared to UMAP(?) Correct Me If I Wrong and BTW we are hoping the new updates ‚ù§",True
@curiousarabidopsis,2023-09-14T07:45:59Z,0,"Hello Josh, Amazing explanation. Thank you so much. Where does 2.1 (lower dimensional distance between a and b ) come from? I am a bit lost there.",True
@xavisolersanchis7145,2023-06-15T11:07:43Z,0,"Hi, thank you very much! Just one question. In your case you could compute the initial distances between the data points as euclidean distances because you are only working wuth two features. How are they computed when you have much more features, do you always start with euclidean distances??",True
@3Mus-cat-tears,2023-03-09T10:16:54Z,0,Hi Josh! Thank you for the info! It's really helpful.   What to do if I have zeros or NAs in my dataset? I couldnt find anything on imputation before UMAP on Google :(,True

@ass_im_aermel,2022-03-30T13:04:03Z,1,"Hi Josh! Is it possible, that you make some videos for time series related topics like: serial correlation or the box jenkins method?   And thank you for all the videos you made in the last years. They are awesome :-)",True
@veenakumar2384,2022-03-29T18:30:06Z,0,how do i know which is the best curve plotted against similarity scores (Y axis) and the cluster points wrt distances (X axis)?,True
@cahbe6108,2022-03-28T14:49:37Z,1,Thank you for the great video!  One question: What happens if there are multiple closest neighbors with the same distance? Then there will be multiple similarity scores = 1. Then changing sigma might not help to get close to log2(num_neighbors) for the sum of similarities.,True

@alexmiller3260,2022-03-16T15:37:38Z,0,"Hey, Josh! Can you make video(s) about likelihood and MLE for an unknown distribution, if it can't be easily approximated or it's impossible to approximate? Because everyone talks about well-known distributions, but literally nothing about working with something unknown.  Of course it would be better, if you decided to make a playlist with everything about unknown distributions, but couple of videos is also OK",True
