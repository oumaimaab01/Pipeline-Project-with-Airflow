@TheHullahopp,2023-05-27T11:21:10Z,0,"Hi, I am totally confused by the abbreviation of SSR. On other websides this is used as Sum of Squared or Regression, but in your ppt, this is the Sum of Squared Residuals. So these are totally opposing definitions of SSR. (In regression there is the SST = SSR + SSE, where the SSE is the definiton of observed minus predicted; therefore this ""amount"" of error is need to be low). Am I correct? (You mention the SSE on page 63; which could be a ""new"" SSR by prediction line?)",True
