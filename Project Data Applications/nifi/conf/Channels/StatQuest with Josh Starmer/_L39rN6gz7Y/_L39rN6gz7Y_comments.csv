Most of the ML videos and many of the classes out there only talk about very generalized, high-level ideas of these models. You don’t. You always do such a great job giving clear yet detailed explanation of the nitty gritty of these models. Between the ISLP/ISLR books and your videos I am able to gain basic understanding beyond just making api calls of caret in R or sklearn in python. It really made me feel like I am learning, instead of just typing formulas on the keyboard. Could never thank you enough ❤❤❤",True

@panzhang9751,2023-09-03T15:13:53Z,0,"One question , In regression tree, we use sum-of-square as loss function for training the model, so we can obtain predicted rule as mean of sample labels in the leaf node. However, why do we use Gini index in classification tree? It's definitely not a loss function! Loss function should be a measure between predicted labels and true labels, but Gini index just involve predicted label. If no loss function, how do we train the model? What's more, we cannot derive a predicted rule as in regression problem as mean of samples' label, so why do we predict a new sample as majority voting?（most frequent labels in one leaf node）. Why is it reasonable?",True

I am sure it is in another one of your videos, and I was hoping you can tell me which one:  you mentioned about confidence at the end.  so, how to you resolve the STRENGTH of your confidence?  for example, you may put criteria to the number of values in a node (say 10 or more), but one with 7 and 3 in one node (70%) is likely not as confident as one with (say, 68 and 32)... 68%.  in other words, I would think there is some kind of a hypothesis test that declares how confident one is in a nodes statement.

I'm using this video as a reference in implementing classification trees (eventually hoping to work my way up to forests) from scratch in python.   One question I have is, the algorithm presented in the video seems to check every possible option per split, and for the continuous case the number of possible things you need to test scale with the amount of datapoints that the tree is being fitted on (though you probabily don't need to test the average between _every_ pair of datapoints when the amount of data is sufficiently large). I have not done a time complexity analysis, but I feel like as the number of features and datapoints increase, the tree will take a LOT more time to fit to the data (even if you define a max depth hyperparameter).  Are there any tricks/techniques you can point me to that would reduce the computation needed to make the tree and/or whether these concerns are even valid?",True

@amolkabugade3728,2021-06-22T04:20:22Z,0,"1) hello sir, what if we have 3 or more categories in our output/target variabe like (yes,no,bit) then how will our split look ,will it be in the same way as we have done above with one more category in our count  like  (yes  , no , bit).......this way           1        2     0  2) what if we have 3 or categories in our independent variables  like (Y , N , D). will it be like 3 branches                                     one for Y , one for N ,  one for D  sir please correct me if i am wrong... thank you...for providing such an awesome content.",True
@shameladdas4548,2021-06-17T13:49:27Z,3,Excellent video! I think there is an error in 11:44. The left leaf under Age<15 should have 2 (and not 3) under the No condition.,True

I have a small doubt though (you might find it silly :|) , do we have only binary splits in CART ? While deciding the optimal/best split for a numeric variable basis gini impurity, we create 2 splits.  What if I want multiple splits (> 2 ),how do I proceed in that case ?",True

You are the best teacher I have ever had! We need more great channels like you!  Double Bam! Could you make some videos in different distributions series? Like topic in Gamma, chi-squared, beta, poisson distribution, etc. I could hardly find a Youtube channel that explains them clearly. :(  Triple Bam! I know you did not “officially” teach statistics and just made videos for fun, but the world needs you to create more great videos lol! Your “To-do” list would be huge! Keep it up! :D",True
