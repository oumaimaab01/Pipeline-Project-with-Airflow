But Lasso regression actually does the same thing, with the difference that small coefficients entering the penalty in its linear form.

I often watch other teaching videos and can't remember most of it afterwards, but I can remember almost everything that you are saying after the first time watching. Amazing job! I have one question though. You were saying that the regression model in the beginning had low bias and high variance. Does it not have high bias? As far as I know bias represents the expected generalization (or test) error, if we were to fit a very large training set. If we fit that simple model to a lot of data, the generalization error would be rather high, because it could not capture the true patterns in the data.",True

I do not understand why lasso regression, which uses the absolute value of a slope, can shrink the slope of a (nearly) useless predictor to zero.

If the test data had more slope(.i.e they are on top of the train data). Then wouldn't doing regularization give poor results. Why always decreasing the slope is better, can't there be a case where increasing the slope is beneficial?",True
@Viper36P,2020-07-17T22:10:46Z,0,"Hello! As I understand both concepts, the regression penalty will (always) lead to a reduced slope (or whatever parameter) in order to match the testing data with lower variance. In the previous video on ridge regression it was said that lambda can take values from 0 to +\infty. Now, imagine the training data initially leads to a fit with small parameters (e. g. slope), that underestimates the suitable parameters regarding long term observations. In this case the penalty and therefore further reduction of the parameters result in higher variance instead of lower, doesn`t it? Thanks and Greetings!",True

If we divide the weight by 1,000 to get unit in kilogram, is the Lasso Regression different? As I understand, the least square estimated B1-kilogram should be 1,000 times higher than the B1-gram.

@user-xf1gm4en4e,2018-12-13T03:11:26Z,1,I have a question!  Does astrological sign and airspeed of swallow mean irreducible error?  or Do they have any other meanings?,True
@Kabletor,2018-12-09T16:37:30Z,1,"Great videos...thanks for making them. It is clear how squared values differ from absolute values...BUT why, if I apply the same 'lambda' value and the same regression to all 4 parameters (slope, diet difference, astrological offset and airspeed scalar) they should behave differently and only the silly ones disappear (astrological offset and airspeed scalar) in case I use lasso regression ? I hope my question is clear... THANKS !!!!",True
@Jan-oj2gn,2018-12-04T23:02:23Z,2,This channel is pure gold. This would have saved me hours of internet search... Keep up the good work!,True

@yunaldk,2018-11-29T06:45:05Z,1,Music is also good!!,True
@alessandrofesti208,2018-11-28T13:04:43Z,1,You're great!! Thank You,True
@johnholbrook1447,2018-11-26T22:08:14Z,1,Fantastic videos - very well explained!,True
@yuzaR-Data-Science,2018-11-26T08:34:01Z,2,"Thanks a lot! Amazing explanation! Please, continue the great work and add more on statistics, probability in general and machine learning in particular. Sinse Data Science suppose to have a great future, I am certain that your channel also will prosper a great deal!",True
@yashranawat6227,2018-11-21T20:25:04Z,1,Doing god's work buddy,True
@user-gb5yq9lv9k,2018-11-21T14:44:24Z,1,And...why the line does not go steeper?,True
@user-gb5yq9lv9k,2018-11-21T14:41:55Z,1,"I have one thing that do not understand, if the sample size is small and has to use lasso or regid regression, and determine ""lamda"" using a cross validation, why not use more sample in the training data set and reduce the size of test set?",True
@abdullahmoiz8151,2018-11-19T09:43:21Z,1,Brilliant explanation didnt need to check out any other video,True
@atiqkhan7803,2018-10-30T21:32:31Z,1,This is brilliant. Thanks for making it publicly available,True
@abhilashsharma1992,2018-10-30T17:10:49Z,1,DOUBLE BAM!!,True
@somakkamos,2018-10-22T18:02:45Z,1,hmmm....  i am not sure how using absolute makes the penalty zero and removes the useless variables.   pls help.. i went thru similar qestions  and your reply in the comments sections..and not sure still,True
@Phobos11,2018-10-19T12:13:26Z,260,"Good video, but didn't really explain how LASSO gets to make a variable zero. What's the difference between squaring a term and using the absolute value for that?",True
@sonicking12,2018-10-12T22:22:50Z,1,"Would you recommend this LASSO approach over other variable-selection approaches in linear regression or logistic regression, like stepwise selection?",True
@omarbolanos7842,2018-10-12T04:07:17Z,1,You rock!,True
@danielawesome12,2018-10-08T20:55:48Z,0,"Why though? Mathematically I don't understand why taking the absolute value of a parameter instead of squaring the parameter means it can reach zero?   Assume we had a linear model with data points (1,5) and (2,5). Then wouldn't the slope parameter be 0 in both ridge regression and Lasso regression?",True
@tiborcamargo5732,2018-10-05T22:25:18Z,5,That Monty Python reference though... good video btw :),True
@annd6920,2018-10-05T15:06:40Z,1,"Hi Josh,  could you please make video(s) on Correspondence Analysis, Chi-Square distance and Multiple contingency table?  Learning from your videos are much efficient than several books combined :) !",True
@admw3436,2018-10-03T19:01:24Z,15,"My teacher is 75 years old, explained us Lasso during one hour , without explaining it. But this is a war I can win :), thanks to your efforts.",True
@yulinliu850,2018-10-02T13:01:04Z,1,Thanks Josh!,True
@longkhuong8382,2018-10-02T11:02:18Z,1,Hooray!!!! excellent video as always Thank you!,True
@stefanomauceri,2018-10-01T20:54:35Z,3,I prefer the intro where is firmly claimed that StatQuest is bad to the bone. And yes I think this is fundamental.,True
@scorpion7434,2018-10-01T20:41:34Z,1,I use LASSO regularisation to fix overfitting.. What do you think about this?,True
@kyoosikkim749,2018-10-01T17:38:53Z,0,"The other day, I had homework to write about Lasso and I struggled.. wish I had seen this video a few days earlier.. Thank you as always!",True
@citypunter1413,2018-10-01T16:06:15Z,64,One of the best explanation of Ridge and Lasso regression I have seen till date... Keep up the good work....Kudos !!!,True
@codewithsid2063,2018-10-01T14:53:52Z,1,Keep it up man. Awesome content.,True
@ayush612,2018-10-01T14:39:07Z,1,"Yeahhhh!!! I was the first to express Gratitude to Josh for this awesome video!! Thanks Josh for posting this and man! your channel is growing.. last time, 4 months ago it was 12k. You have the better stats  ;)",True
