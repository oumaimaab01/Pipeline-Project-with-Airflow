@rmcgraw7943,2022-04-27T08:04:45Z,0,"I could use a better understanding of Shannon‚Äôs Information Entropy.  Everything I‚Äôve read says that greater surprise is the equivalent of greater entropy of the information conveyed.  That is to say, if all odds are even, that‚Äôs the maximum entropy information can be carried.  This, somewhat, makes sense to me but in a counter inititive way.  Is it correct to say that the less informational content a fact has, the greater it‚Äôs entropy (chaos), and thus any outcome would be a surprise, since you would have no informational context with which you could predict or guess would be the outcome?   If that is so, then entropy is a measure of how useless a fact is, how little information is conveyed by a fact, state, etc.  So, on one side, we have entropy and complete off the wall guessing and the other we have logical inference via deduction/induction.  Am I understanding Claude Shannon‚Äôs Entropy.  I can see how such a measure could be useful in creating encryption routinues with high levels of entropy, low levels of structure, but I guess I just don‚Äôt see how I can apply it to any qualitative evaluation.  Perhaps you know a good book that gives me some information about how it can be applied in real world AI/ML/analysis/Bayes Probablistic Models, etc.  Thanks.  Love the content, hate the intro.

When making the bet you know you have 213 (N_total) people in StatLand. When you find the outcome of the first bet wouldn't you change the probability from the definite heard of (N_A) or not heard pile (N_B)?

@rileyregan2900,2021-04-18T17:31:50Z,0,"Hopefully yall can get schools to use you and not Con Academy (yes I spelled it that way on purpose). That shit is so overrated. Terrible homework platform, videos with example problems that are irrelevant to the homework, quizzes with answers that are actually wrong, etc. Professors are so lazy that they pretend Khan Academy isnt trash, but it is.",True

@apah,2021-04-03T20:09:00Z,166,"I binged your Statquest stat fundamentals and just finished it. Can't express how much it has helped me build a sense and create a solid base for my ongoing data science masters. The older i grow, the more i realize that in some areas of life, it is best to treat adults like the children they actually are in these specific areas. Unbelievably efficient. You're an amazing teacher who deeply understood how much repetition & maintaining a trail of thought is key (+ bite sized format). I managed to grasp an in depth understanding of most concepts with rarely if ever having to rewind thanks to the number of times you repeat and synthesize key notions. THANKS JOSH !!

@redcat7467,2021-03-30T06:40:14Z,1,"StatSquatch seems to be surprisingly unsofisticated in matters of probabilities, what raises some questions on the nature of his fallacies and whether he has some longstanding motives. However, should StatSquatch be a bad gambler indeed, I bet he will make a good example for gambler's fallacy in a new StatQuest (poor StatSquatch, BamSquatch would never make such mistakes)!",True
