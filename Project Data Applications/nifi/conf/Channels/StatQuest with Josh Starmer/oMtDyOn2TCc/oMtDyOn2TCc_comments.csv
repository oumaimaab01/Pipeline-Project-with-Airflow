@juanete69,2024-05-18T22:30:50Z,0,In another video you spoke about dividing by the lenght of the sequence and the dividing by the sum of the column counts. Is it better to do it like that or to normalize like you explain in this video?,True

@ISK_VAGR,2023-08-23T11:11:33Z,0,That is crazy good. Now I have to mention. That I don't believe that one should go with the one that looks good. There is always a reason to choose one or other method. Rationalizing why using centroids for example will provide more robustness to the result because outliers is a better argument if you want to keep a conservative interpretation. Another is using different clustering methods and see those that converge in similar results would be advisable. At least that is my opinion. In any case super good statquest,True

And what does that tell us? What are we looking for? I know these are big questions. You can just provide an example. My stats background is based mostly from linear regression, where samples are rows and variables are columns, but it always seems like you're rows and columns are reversed.",True

It's very... empirical... I somehow expected that certain parameters would fit best certain scenarios/ types of problems . Has anybody checked systematically the various permutations of parameters for ""best fitting"" of a problem (say gene expression). Perhaps, the scenarios need to be better defined in order to find this correspondence. It seems that there are cases in which a certain combination of parameters fit best the essence of the system , according to the researcher's experience. Maybe scrutinizing such cases can reveal a certain feature of the system that is not encountered in seemingly similar cases for which the combination doesn't work so well...? Maybe some empirical ""constant"" a la theorems encountered in physics can do the trick? ;)",True
