@user-gp3ts9ib6f,2024-05-23T07:35:26Z,1,Thank u for your knowledge sharing. This video is helpful for me.,True
@alinaastakhova8412,2024-05-20T13:02:45Z,0,"Thank You for amazing explanation, still I am a little confused. On 4.10 of the video You have the probabilty for a mean >=0.5 as 0.48 and on 5.02 of the video the probability for a mean >= 0.5 becomes 0.47... How is that? And for the median - how do You get the probability for a median >= 1.8 as 0.01. How is that calculate once the bootstrapped distributions for medians does not go beyond ~ 0.5 units? Isn't the calculated probability simply a portion of the distribution beyond the given value (like 1.8 for the median in our example)? What do I miss?",True

@DrThalesAlexandre,2024-04-27T14:11:56Z,0,Amazing video!  Any ideas on how to make bootstrapping run faster on python? It starts lagging once you are doing > 10^5 trials with large sample sizes.,True

@rissalhedna5534,2024-02-02T17:00:08Z,1,Amazing video as usual! I just was wondering why the value of 0.05 was used as a threshold for the p-value. Was it just arbitrarily set or did we assume that it was meaningful for our experiment with the drug ?,True
@AkashSiddabattula,2024-01-05T05:56:17Z,0,"please reply!! when you were calculating the p value i think we were supposed to find the p value supporting the null hypothesis and if that value is less than 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis, but here you were calculating the p value of observing mean value of 0.5 or something more extreme and i think this is not supposed to be null hypothesis, then if we get a p value of greater than 0.05 of observing the mean >=0.5 that means often we will get mean >= 0.5 which means drug is having some effect. This is what i understood can u explain?",True

@SunSan1989,2023-08-29T00:57:14Z,0,"Perhaps because of the different ways of thinking between East and West, as an Asian I find it easier to understand not to switch to a mean of zero and use the drug no effect as -0.5, but to do so is somewhat inconsistent with the null hypothesis method，good tutorial.  There is another problem, that is, the example of 0.36 probability and the probability of less than -0.5 is 0.16 and the probability of greater than 0.5 is 0.47, which seems to be a bit contradictory to do bootstrapping  on the basis of the null hypothesis. If the bootsrtrapping times are enough, shouldn't the probability of less than 0.5 and greater than 0.5 be equal?",True
@PauloBuchsbaum,2023-07-18T02:38:29Z,0,"Great video and I understood your procedure perfectly.  I just believe that, in the process of shifting 0.5 to the left to redo the bootstrap taking the mean to 0, it would not be strictly necessary (except for ease of understanding)  I think that instead of redoing the shifted bootstrap, it would be enough in the original bootstrap to take the probability of above 1.0 plus the probability below 0.0.  In the original boostrap this would correspond respectively to get the probability above 0.5 and below  -0.5, after shifting 0.5 to the left.  Am I wrong?  Another point is that at 4:11, the probability above 0.5 was 48%, but at 5:04 to get the p-value you used 47%.",True

@LittleLightCZ,2022-09-15T19:37:40Z,0,"The main question is, how is it different from simply running a t.test to see if the mean equals to 0 or not? Is there anything that bootstrapping adds to it? Originally I thought that bootstrapping might help for example to get tighter confidence intervals without the need to take more sample data in the field, but according to my tests which I made with boot library, the confidence intervals from the bootstrapped data are basically the same as the ones computed from the original data. Well, when I call boot.ci() they tend to be a little bit tighter, but I think it's because the t.test computation is probably a little more conservative (I guess).",True

@jamesstrickland833,2022-06-01T18:58:13Z,2,Must we always consider both tails when calculating a pvalue from bootstrapping?  Had we looked at the medians and only considered the right tail that would have been significant (@.05) to reject Ho.  Or did we assume that Ha was not equal to zero and therefore a two tail test?,True
@willw234,2022-05-30T00:09:46Z,0,"Thanks for the very clear and informative description of this. I have a question - whenever the absolute value of the mean/median/statistic-of-interest of the original data is greater than the absolute value calculated from the shifted data, the p-value will be zero. I have a large set of tests to run and would like to do an FDR correction on the resultant set of p-values, but a not-insignificant number of them are zero.

@DrMcZombie,2021-07-14T12:03:37Z,0,"Hi Josh and thank's for the overview. I have been using bootstrapping for quite some time now, but not to look at p-values for just one data set. What you describe is---more or less---a different kind of t-test, right?  I am using bootstrapping for determining confidence intervals, but also to compare two datasets, e.g., I use two models to predict data and compare the models' performance with bootstrapping. For example, is the root-mean-squared prediction error (RMSE) larger in data set A in comparison to data set B? When repeating this (e.g.) 1000 times, each time comparing the  RMSEs, I get a p-value from these comparisons. --> Model A performed better than model B in 990 of 1000 comparisons --> p = 0.99 (or 0.01) I hope this was understandable.
