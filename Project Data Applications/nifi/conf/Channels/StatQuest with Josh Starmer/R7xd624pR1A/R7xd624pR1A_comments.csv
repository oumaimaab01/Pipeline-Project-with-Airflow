@2460z_htdja,2024-04-30T12:05:55Z,0,"I am really grateful for having found this site. I just want a simple suggestion as to what type of statistics (Anova, chi-square, etc.) I should use to determine my goal below. I am truly confused yet optimistic for someone generous out there, and I would greatly appreciate any additional comments or suggestions to clarify or simplify my statement or claim here. Thank you in advance.  ""Among the randomly selected senior students in the eight (4 public and 4 private) US south-west states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), their responses are unanimous (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree) as regards participating in home gardening rather than school gardening.""",True

@pavoldzama4641,2024-03-04T14:16:07Z,0,"Hi, thanks for the awesome video ... I have a question, I still cannot get my head around the concept of this matrix... you have the formula y= 1* 2,2 + 0*3.6 + residual of the value ...   I thought that only residuals are going into calculation ...  how do we get from this bunch of y= equations one below the other to the final calculation, how does it fit in there? I am missing a bridge there. As well once there is residual at the end of the y equation and other times there is not, is this annotation later used counting with this residuals?  If I understand correctly SS(fit) = sum of all these y equations together .... and I don't get why we need this matrix there if we do only the sum of residuals anyway ... or if I follow the equation literally I have sum residual squared (nobody written is squared but I suppose so) plus mean (which depends if is on or off according to the matrix)??   Thanks a lot for your response",True
@ryanmckenna2047,2023-12-06T17:58:32Z,1,"Here the p-value for the mean of the data is equal to the number of parameters for the equation of the mean and the p-vaue for the fit of the data is equal to the number of parameters for the fit of the data.  How does this related to the typical notion of p-values (probability we should not reject null hypothesis)? Also once F has been computed, is F the itself a P-value or a value that we need to compute a p-value?",True

@SNAKE1375,2023-07-20T14:24:16Z,0,"Hello Josh, it's me again....I had a question concerning the Anova. I still don't understand why we have to use an Anova when we have to compare a reference condition to several drug treatments A-B-C done in the same experiment. For instance, I am only interested in the effect of drug A or drug B compared to a control condition.  So I only need a T-test. Why should I have to do an Anova?",True
@aiswaryanair9033,2023-07-19T20:32:17Z,0,"Pardon me if this is a dumb question , but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea! Why would one prefer to do a  linear regression for T test? How does it make this better?",True
