@RedShipsofSpainAgain,2022-10-27T06:38:58Z,0,"Great video Josh.  One suggestion: at 8:00, show the original formula for target encoding on the screen above the formula where you are filling in the values. This helps the viewer visually map the values you're plugging in to the original equation.",True
@profitabletea8297,2022-10-22T21:42:07Z,1,"Bam!!   Man i'm working for CFA level 2 and was advised to look at your videos to understand the Machine Learning section of the program. Not only teaching style is sooooooo cool and funny, but it is also very pedagogic!!!   Thanks a lot for your humor and good mood. I'm a big fan of yours (just after 5 minutes watching your videos). Baaaam!!   I'm still laughing at some of the sound effects you make with your own voice ""If you don't like Silly songs, Machine learning, and don't like stats, then you won't like Statquest"" sound effect: woin wooooiiiiinnnnnnn. AHAHHA",True

@preet111,2022-10-20T17:21:50Z,2,"Hi josh sir, thanks for all the videos. I completed your machine learning playlist, and trust me i was able to crack interviews so easily. It's all because of you that i have finally been able to get a high paying data science job. All credit goes to you, as promised I'll go for the maximum perks and support you always after getting my first pay. Again thank you so much.",True

@apmelqui1,2022-10-18T20:16:13Z,2,"Awesome!!! Another great video!!! Thanks for sharing your knowledge with all of us josh, even feeling tired! And yeah!! it would be great to see you playing the tabla! Actually, another suggestion would be if you talk a little bit about the relationship between music and coding! I'm pretty sure it will be a lot of stuff involved in both:))) Bam!",True
@NARFkarriere3,2022-10-18T18:49:28Z,0,"Thanks for yet another great video. If I want to use the transformed variable in a classification model, for example a logistic regression model. Then I would get coefficients for ¬´Favorite color¬ª and ¬´Height¬ª. So I could plug in values for favorite color and height - and the model will predict if you love Troll 2 or not. Say for example that one record shows that favorite color is blue and heigt is 1.46. But since blue has different values after the transformation, and some of these values might also mean green and red. How will I know which value to feed into the model? I guess I dont understand how to apply the transformed variable, so really appreciate your advice. Thanks in advance  üé∏üôè",True
