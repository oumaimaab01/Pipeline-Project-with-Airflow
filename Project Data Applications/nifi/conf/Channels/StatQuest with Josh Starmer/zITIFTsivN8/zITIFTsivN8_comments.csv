Now i can calculate N SS(simple) values and thus, N F_values.

These are just two examples from linear algebra but I would also hope there are interesting historical examples using multiple linear regression and statistics too.

I'm wondering how can this interpretation be done properly? I'm thinking if there are 3 predictors x1,x2,x3, does order of adding them affects the R-sq and p-value? Like if added in order of x1,x2,x3 vs x1,x3 vs  x2,x3, these are 3 different scenarios where x3 is added, which should give 3 different incremental R-sq and p-values? How do we interpret properly whether x3 is helpful to the predicting y if the state of currently included predictors affects the results from adding a new predictor?
