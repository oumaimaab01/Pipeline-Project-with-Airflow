@datdao6982,2023-06-15T13:00:22Z,4,"Hi Josh, thank you so much. You have helped me a lot on the road of becoming an analyst. One quick question: if I use the logistic function to turn logistic regressions feature coefficients to probability. How would I interpret the new probability coefficient now? What I mean is like with log odd, we can say that the log odd of the odds of something increases/decreases by [insert_coefficient] with one unit increase of an independent variable.",True
