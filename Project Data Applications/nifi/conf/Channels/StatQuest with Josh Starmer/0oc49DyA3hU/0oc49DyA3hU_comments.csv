I completely understand what you said about us only being able to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, but I have seen many published papers stating their main hypotheses to be ""there is no difference between groups"". They then state in the discussion ""the results support our hypothesis"" when the tests find no difference and claim that the intervention is equally helpful for different age groups, for example. Is this problematic? Should the peer review have said something? Should they have switched the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis somehow because the type I error becomes the type II error and vice versa? What would be the algorithm for doing such research when they want to prove that the intervention is as effective as the other one?",True

@kinjalvora3352,2020-12-31T23:46:09Z,0,"If I were to summarise it again:  NULL Hypothesis is the opposite of what we are supposedly trying to figure out. If it says there is a difference, the null hypothesis would be there is no difference. If the general hypothesis is that the coronavirus is killing 1000 people a day, the NULL hypothesis is that it is not killing 1000 people a day.... it could be less or more but not 1000...  Have I understood it right?  The NULL hypothesis hypothesizes :P  that there is no difference between the two drugs.  If we see that the results are more or less consistent:  for example if the difference in the recovery time between drug A and drug B is somewhat consistent, ignoring random factors (that cannot be explained) -  It basically means that the NULL hypothesis can be rejected i.e there IS a difference between the two drugs and how they affect the recovery.  If we see that small changes result in switching the difference in recovery in favour of one of the other, we FAIL to reject the NULL Hypothesis i.e  THERE IS NO Difference or very little difference between the two drugs and how they affect the recovery. right?  why do we state it like the way you did?",True

How is hypothesis testing used in the data science industry ? can you give me a couple of use cases? Like, say If I am solving a business problem, and I have 30 features and a target variable. do I use hypothesis testing to check if the relationship between any 2 variables is significant or not? like that am I doing hypothesis testing for all the trends/patterns observed during feature engineering to check if the relationship is due to random choice or if it really exists? I was just thinking about the bigger picture in the industry, please let me know, thank you :)",True
