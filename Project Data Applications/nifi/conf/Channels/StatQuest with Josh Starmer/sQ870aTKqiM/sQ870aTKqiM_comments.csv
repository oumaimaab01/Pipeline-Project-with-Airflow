@knightedpanther,2023-02-05T03:42:23Z,0,"Thanks Josh for the amazing video. I have two questions and also my opinions on them, if you can please help guide my thinking:  1. How do we deal with outliers in the training data before fitting Random Forests?  Here is what I think:  I think outliers can mess with the performance of Random Forests and we should remove them. This is because Random Forests will have tendency to split and isolate those outlier regions whenever that feature is selected which has outlier values. If the y values contain outliers, the problem is even more severe.  2. Does scaling the data before fitting random forest increase the performance of Random Forests? Or for that matter Gradient Boosting?  Here is what I think:  I think that scaling  will not have an impact on performance as when we are splitting we are only looking at the output values for all variables. The final metric, sum of squared residuals does not contain any X. We only iterate over a range oof possible values of X. So the scale of Xs should not have any impact on what X is selected.  Please let me know if I got it right!",True

Can we said what RF hyperparameters for every ""refine guess step"" should be? Especially max_depth, I think that other hyperparams aren't as much important and we can leave them default, but default max_depth is None => very deep trees, kind of overfitting.      2. Follow up to the above: What about the random state of our RF's -> should it be fixed? If yes, then ""the same"" RF's are trained on better and better data at each iteration (our data may converge), if not then training is more random, but impossible to repeat (our data may not converge - my observations).     3. What our stop criterion should be? With percentage change (x_{it} - x_{it-1})/x_{it-1} there is a risk of dividing by zero.     4. Please tell me if I'm right: We can write our weighted average formula as  dot product of the proximity matrix (each row divided by its sum) and dataframe values, but we can't include our imputed values, so we have to set it to the zeros before the dot product?",True
