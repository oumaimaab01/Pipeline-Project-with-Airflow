@lolyikes9600,2019-12-27T21:11:26Z,0,"great video! I just have 1 question about the control track. why does it show very little reads, instead of lots of reads everywhere? for the actual experimental track, there‚Äôs a high concentration in that area because we‚Äôve isolated DNA fragments that a particular protein binds to, and those DNA fragments occur near one another in the genome, right (is that what the x-axis, if we can call it that, of the track is? the location on the genome)? while in the control track, we didn‚Äôt isolate any DNA fragments. so why wouldn‚Äôt there be a large amount of reads everywhere on the control track, instead of a very little amount like there is in the video? thanks!",True
