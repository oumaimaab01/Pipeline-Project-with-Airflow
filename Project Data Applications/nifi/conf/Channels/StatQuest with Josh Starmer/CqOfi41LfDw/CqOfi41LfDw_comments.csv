@epistemophilicmetalhead9454,2023-11-14T07:30:34Z,1,"neural network consists of nodes and weights (like slope) and biases (like y intercept) and it's like finding a non-straight line curve that fits your data you start with unknown w's and b's and estimate their values through back propagation input, hidden and output layers. hidden layers' nodes use activation functions like sigmoid, relu, softplus that are curves themselves and 'add' them together to get a final curve as output to predict data input layer has x. x becomes wx+b. then you do activation function f(wx+b) to get a y value. [relu ge it's max(0,x). sigmoid ge it's exp(x)/( exp(x)+1 ) and for softplus it's ln(1+exp(x))   you do this for all x values in the range and you'll get a range of y values that correspond (actually) to a very small range in the activation function [eg: x goes from from 0-1 but wx+b will correspond to a much smaller range of the activation function. so this means that different ranges of the activation function might give rise to different looking curves] each node in the hidden layers will give you one kind of curve and then the calculation keeps on going for how many ever nodes necessary. let's skip to last hidden layer. the curves have been calculated. you have intermediate y values ready. now add all of them to get a different looking final curve. set of y values corresponding to this final curve are your output binary classification: if that y values is close to 1, predict success. if y value is close to 0, predict failure",True

Input 5 Features via the Input layer (eg. n = 5)  2.	Hidden Layer is in charge of fitting the squiggle.  a.	Using those 5 features, it produces different parts of the squiggle. b.	It does this by pushing the 5 features through an activation function you choose (activation function does a nonlinear transformation)  3.	Output Layer adds up the Hidden Layer‚Äôs squiggles (linear combination) and produces final prediction. a.

This video explains that although the particular weights and biases may appear random at first glance, it is through their summation/cancellation that an order emerges. Also, kudos for introducing a new beginner example -- I genuinely did not realise that there were other applications outside of image recognition lol (I am a beginner to this!).

I have evaluated all parental lines both in the field (agronomic traits) and also using molecular markers (present or absence of an allele in a locus). I have also evaluated the agronomic performance of the 30 hybrids. My question is if I can use machine learning to estimate the hybrid performance based on its parental performance. Based on my very limited knowledge in ML, I guess it is a type of regression analysis, but I cannot understand how to do the regression it since the parents are only 6 but the outcomes are 30.¬† In addiction the Molecular data of the parents are nominal (presence or absence).

For example suppose a network to predict a digit. How do we know a number should look like an 8 or 0??   I mean first we calculate the mean for all the training data features?? And so we know what does an 8 or 0 look like?? And how far are  we from an actual value( 0, 1, 2, , ..., 9) are?

Meanwhile tried to investigate myself stuff about deep-learning, and in this context I have couple of questions still opened to me 1)Maybe what i miss is what would happen if we do not use activation function at all (like what does it give) 2)Shoudn't there  also be another activation function at the end? After summing and biasing the output of two neurons? 3)Some activation functions squuez the results from 0-1, it doesn fit if i want to predict values which expected to be from let say -100 to 100, how do we deal with it? does learning process include trying different acticvation functions by an algorythm? 4)And may I ask you to say couple of words abut number of neurons needed  as we need to get more complex function (unversal proximity theorem etc) 5)Same about number of layers needed why we use more layers?",True
