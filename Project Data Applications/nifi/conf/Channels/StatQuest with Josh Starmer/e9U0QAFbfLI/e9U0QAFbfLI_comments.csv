And one more question, if the three phrases have the same length and two of them have the same meaning but have used different words, like: A) I like Gymkata. B) I love Gymkata. C) I like volleyball.

@Ghulinzer,2023-01-30T05:58:43Z,1,"Great video!

Cosine similarly measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space and returns a similarity score as explained in the video, while Pearson's correlation measure the linear relationship between 2 variables.",True
