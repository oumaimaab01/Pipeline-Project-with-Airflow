@chunzili6256,2023-05-09T13:07:22Z,0,"Hi, Josh, I a question about the distribution of the residuals. If we expect that they are symmetrially distributed, why the mean and the max should be the same distant from zero. I think the mean should be close to the zero which means that the data fits the line, but the max means the extreme value, why it should be the same distant as the mean from zero? Thanks!",True

@tmsplltrs,2021-01-25T10:02:53Z,0,"It's very confusing when you say 'we want to'. When you said  'we want the min value and the max value to have approximately the same distance from zero', I was assuming you meant that if they aren't the model is not reliable. But then you say 'we want the p-value to be <0.05',  which is a strange thing to say because when you're doing statistical analysis you shouldn't WANT to find a significant value. But does this mean that the state of the residuals has any bearing on the significance of our variable?",True

I think our null hypothesis for the slope is that it is equal to 0 i.e. no (linear) dependence on X.

It is pretty much what I had in mind when I mentioned it to you. You really managed to keep the ""how to"" video very short but in the same time to add enough detail so that one can directly apply the theory to a dataset at hand. Me likes it ;) May I suggest an add-on video about doing multiple linear regression? As other topic,  multivariate analysis with R companions. Maybe adding R companions to the topics you have already covered theoretically: PCA, heatmaps, clustering etc? Thanks a lot for your work. Maybe you could get compensated for it? Why not add the option to those who appreciate your work?",True
