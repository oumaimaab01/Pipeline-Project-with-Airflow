@ayoubmarah4063,2020-02-03T16:00:40Z,0,is it necessary to scale the data ? becuse sometimes a variable might have a std near 0 wich generate NaNs,True
@alexisaddicted,2020-02-01T13:42:46Z,0,"What about when you have +100 variables ? Plotting graph might not be a solution, and we perhaps would need to ""guess""/test the amount of PCA's that we need beforehand, is there any systematic way to achieve that ? It is mostly like, just run a loop, each with increasing number of PCAs and just see which one yields better results ? (Spray and pray type of solution)",True

It was score for each record (gene). Please correct me if I am wrong but isn't loading score the correlation between original fields (wt1, wt2 ...etc) and components?  Thank you",True

Actually, you have said in your clip, but would like to ask to get a bit clearer. When using PCA of Scikitlearn, we must do train and test, is it right? The one in your clip is just part of it, right? I ask this because the result that I do following your step is different with the result from other programmes (CANOCO).
