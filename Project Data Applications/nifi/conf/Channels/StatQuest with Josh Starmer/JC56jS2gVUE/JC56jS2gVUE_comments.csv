@karannchew2534,2022-04-03T16:47:25Z,1,"Hi Josh, While I understand the definitions, I don't get why the individual contributing deviances are called ""Deviance Residual"". It's quite confusing especially there is already a  Residual Deviance. I guess this is more like an English than a math question - could you please enlighten?",True
@JaviMoreno5,2022-03-13T12:15:19Z,0,Why in the case of logisitic regression you do not calculate the likelihood of the points to get the deviance? Can you relate the deviance test to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test?,True
@mayurmulik1647,2022-02-06T11:56:02Z,0,How these likelihoods are greater than 1...... can't understand that part...... you didn't mention how you calculated it,True

@haoranzhang3993,2021-11-15T23:10:14Z,0,"Hi Josh, thank you for the nice video again! Question - At point  4:11 mins, could you explain the LOG(1-distance) part? I guess log(1) is from the saturated logistic regression model. How can we get the LOG(distance) from proposed logistic regression model?",True
@garethfuller2700,2021-07-09T16:18:03Z,1,"Why are saturated model likelihoods all 3.3? One would think that, if they're probabilities, they'd be on a scale from 0 to 1. (Timestamp 1:18) Is it that for that fraction of the curve something is X times as likely to happen? If so, how are the likelihoods all determined?",True

@TheAugustinePark,2021-03-08T01:16:22Z,0,Why does the likelihood get maximized when we have a saturated model? Does a saturated model have multiple MLEs?,True

@juniorssz,2020-11-29T11:54:15Z,0,Hi Josh! Could you please create a video explaining clearly the Randomized Quantile Residuals?? (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.1996.10474708). Greetings from Brazil!,True
@inf3rno691,2020-11-22T18:14:02Z,0,In 4:50 we plot  deviance residuals against predicted values? There is any limitation on this graph in generalized linear models?,True
@Han-ve8uh,2020-10-17T10:33:37Z,0,"Is the deviance residual equation at 4:15 directly transformed from the formula at 4:00? How did 1 expression at 4:00 become 2 expressions at 4:15? (positive and negative). At 4:00 the expression is based on saturated model and any proposed model. At 4:15, it says best fitting line, does it mean the 2 formulas for logistic reg deviance residual cannot be used for any proposed model, but only the best fitting model?",True
@dipenmodi1807,2020-08-09T21:30:45Z,0,"Can we use this as a substitute for regular residuals? I am working on a probit model. The command predict resid, residuals gives me an error but works perfectly in case of an OLS reg. How do I check the residuals in case of a probit model?",True

@wei2674,2020-03-01T17:43:31Z,2,"I had the same confusion when I first notice a value>1 when calculating likelihood after just watching the video “logistic regression details Pt2 Maximum likelihood”. Then I realized the video “saturated model and deviance” and this video are explained using normal distribution, and the likelihood here are prob density calculated using pdf of normal dist, which can be >1",True

@jivillain,2019-12-03T17:57:11Z,0,1:00. Isn’t the likelihood of a data point a probability? How can it be greater than 1?,True
@arindamandybhattacharjee1406,2019-11-26T13:51:22Z,0,"Hi Josh! Is there a paper of yours (or one that could please recommend), which I can cite regarding the use of residual deviance for logistic goodness of fit? Thanks! Andy",True

@kheaganeckley8385,2019-10-02T08:59:21Z,1,"Mr Josh, I have been considering the intuition of deviance. Isn't it a bad thing to compare a proposed model to an overfitted model even if we can determine that the proposed model statistic isn't significantly different from the overfitted model i.e making it a ""good model"". Isn't it better to use cross-validation methods. I only ask because you also teach machine learning methods. I have been trying to do cross-validation techniques to GLMS don't know if deviance may be better.",True
@heisenberbrbit5718,2019-04-23T18:35:57Z,0,"Hello Josh, In case of  Deviance Residuals log(1 - Distance Between Points) equals to 0... That would mean the log(0) -> to Infinity. Said so my residual deviance would be much higher, right?  Taking as example the fifth point at 5:16, that would mess up all my residuals. Wondering how to deal with that!! Thankss ... Nice explanations",True
@mayya1284,2018-08-29T19:13:06Z,2,"Mr Josh, if I used Iteratively reweighted least squares to get the parameters. Can I use the theDeviance in measure of goodness of fit a model?!  I would be grateful if you could explain Iteratively reweighted 🙏🏻🙏🏻  Thanks in advance.",True
