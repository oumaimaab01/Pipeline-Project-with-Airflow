@HarryKeightley,2024-03-10T20:42:17Z,0,Thank you for the very clear explanations - this video series is wonderful in its capacity to communicate complex topics in a very clear and understandable manner. I have a question: does the use of the ReLu function for this network result in a less accurate model overall due to its piecewise linearity? It seems the more elegant curve has been replaced by a more simplistic linear-looking triangle. Would this mean a larger network would be needed in order for the model to be more accurate - so that the non-linear relationship between dosage and effectiveness can be modelled more accurately through a more complete/complex interaction of nodes?,True
