@pradeeptripathi1378,2020-04-19T03:57:49Z,0,"Hi....  1) In Gradient boosting for classification, initial prediction was log(odds), but here in XGBoost for classification, initial prediction is Probability (0.5) which you are later converting into log(odds). why we are not starting with intial prediction as log(odds) in XGBoost classification?            2) Formula for similarity score and output value is same except the square of residual in similarity score?",True

@lambdamax,2020-01-13T16:57:54Z,2,"Thanks for boosting my confidence in understanding. There was this recent Kaggle tutorial that said LightGBM model ""usually"" does better performance than xgboost, but it didn't provide any context! I remember that xgboost was used as a gold standard-ish about 2-3 years ago(even CERN uses it if I'm not mistaken). Anyhoo, I hope I can keep up with all of this. I need to turn my boosters on.",True
