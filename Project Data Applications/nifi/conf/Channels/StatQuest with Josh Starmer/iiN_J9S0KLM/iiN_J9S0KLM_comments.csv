@iliya-malecki,2020-05-18T15:04:46Z,0,"Dear Josh Statquest Starmer, please help me to unwrap my brain after it has been wrapped around itself pretty badly. So I've been watching your quantile normalization video, and the message i got is that it's really damn easy, but there is a big but! Distances between each data point are not preserved, obviously, but doesn't it mean we can't use any parametric methods anymore? Like, probability density approximations for each group after this normalization don't mean a thing, so what do we do? Ye i get it we can use rank-based methods, but still, why do we prefer quantile normalization over just moving groups up and down so that their means are equalized, preserving distributions and all that good parametric stuff?",True

@AmithAdiraju1994,2020-05-11T15:36:45Z,1,"@StatQuest with Josh Starmer A video request. If possible, could you please make a video on how Sample Weights and Class Weights affect the performance of models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees with an example, I understand that both are very different models and they use those parameters differently; I followed your series on ABDT and GBDT, but I'd like to know how Weighed Gini Index is calculated taking into account Class Weight and Sample Weight, I searched a lot over the internet and haven't found a straight forward explanation for that; similarly for Loggistic Regression i.e., how would a sample weight and class weight affect the entropy scores.   Thanks for going through this comment anyway ! :)",True

@abhalla,2020-05-09T00:40:00Z,1,"I really enjoy your videos man, they're always clearly explained and have been a tremendous help to me. It'd be really cool if you did something on time series, like something to do with wavelets or dynamic time warping, or anything about time series/time series classification. It helps me tremendously to hear you say things, they seem to automatically fall in place after watching your videos! Thanks so much again",True
