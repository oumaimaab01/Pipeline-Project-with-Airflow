In this video, the first set of residuals you computed it as (Observed - log(odds) = residuals) and in part 4 you calculate it as (Observed - probability = residuals), so in this scenario where we have Observed as 1, log(odds) as 0.7,  and p as 0.66, shouldn't the residuals be (1 - 0.66 = 0.33) instead of (1 - 0.7 - 0.3)?  Love your videos and I am a huge fan!",True

For standard regression tree, we use mean value as output, and choose the feature results in smallest MSE. However in GBDT, the y variable(residuals) is in probability form. The output for each region is in log-odd form, instead of a simple average. Should we still choose the split variable and threshold for each tree by minimizing (residual-output)^2?

@junaidbutt3000,2019-04-08T17:40:44Z,1,Another superb video Josh. The example was very clear and I’m beginning to see the parallels between the regression and classification case.   One key distinction seems to be in calculating the output value of the terminal nodes for the trees.   In the regression case the average was taken of the values in the terminal nodes (although this can be changed based on the loss function selected). In the classification case it seems that a different method is used to calculate the output values at the terminal nodes but it seems a function of the loss function (presumably a loss function which takes into account a Bernoulli process?).  Secondly we also have to be careful in converting the output of the tree ensemble to a probability score. The output is a log odds score and we have to convert it to a probability before we can calculate residuals and generate predictions.   Is my understanding more or less correct here? Or have I missed something important? Thanks again!,True
