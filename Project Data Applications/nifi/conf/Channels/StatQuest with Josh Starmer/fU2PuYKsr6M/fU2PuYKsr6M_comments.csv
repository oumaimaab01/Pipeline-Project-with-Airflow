But practically i will not why because i either +1 or -1.. It will give me value always integer like 3 or -60 or 77 etc. I will never get 0.66. So why it is expected value? I m confused...üòÇ",True

You mentioned it's based on a lot of bets as obviously if you only make one bet, you either win 100 or you lose 10.

@giosang1111,2020-04-28T06:33:17Z,0,Hi. Is the probability always the probability of something happens randomly? Since you say about the probability of random meet a guy heard or never heard of Troll 2. What if something happening is not random. How to calculate the probability then? Thanks,True

@CyreMusashi,2020-04-21T16:51:28Z,0,"Great video, I'm a big fan of the quests! I have a few questions about the first example. Since the population of StatLand is so small, only 213 people, wouldn't your probabilities change significantly over the course of 100 bets? Unlike with the dice, each person you talk to changes everything slightly. Is there a way account for this in the math without actually re-calculating after talking to each person?",True
