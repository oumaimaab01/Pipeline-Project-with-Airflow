The logistic model you have built has a p-value of 0.03, does it indicate that there is a strong relationship between weight and obesity? Just like what you have said in the video, it is not due to chance.  For the R^2 value, 0.39, does it indicate that the model is not good enough? We may need to add more parameters other than weight to classify whether the mice are obese or not.  Hope you can correct me if I get sth wrong, thanks 😁",True

Thanks!",True
@EmoFusionCentral,2019-07-09T18:52:55Z,0,"Hi Josh, could you also please explain the loss functions?",True
@edwardfanboy,2019-06-28T15:29:31Z,0,"The value 5.0 * 10^-17 is not exact, it's an artifact of rounding. All of the arithmetic in whatever software you are using is performed using double-precision floating-point numbers, which basically means that everything is internally rounded to about 16 significant figures. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format",True
@casperhansen3012,2019-04-14T13:10:03Z,2,"Hey Josh, I was wondering about the projecting of points at negative or positive infinity onto the candidate line, or just any line in general. You just say that we project the data onto the line at 5:57. But how does the math work?",True
@manikdhingra1606,2019-04-11T04:04:52Z,1,"Hello Josh, again much thanks for the video.  QQ- @13:27 how did you calculate the p-value using formula [ 2*(LL(fit) - LL(overall Probability))]?  I've already watched P-value video but unable to figure out. Don't know what I am missing. Thanks in advance!",True
@margotalalicenciatura1376,2019-03-14T11:56:36Z,3,"First of all a million thanks for your work man! It's really outstanding and almost infuriating to think how bad teachers are most of the people in stats by contrast. Got two questions: first, you say we can't use least squares since in the log odds scale the residuals are infinite, couldn't we just use them in the probability scale with the squiggly line? Second, are you planning in eventually doing a MCMC StatQuest? That'd be reaaaaally handy. Thankss",True
@chuangchen5547,2019-03-08T08:36:19Z,0,"In the last part of the lecture, why it follows chi-square distribution when we calculate the p-value?  Further, why the chi-square value is determined by 2*(LL(fit) - LL(overall))??  Thanks.",True
@TheRamnath007,2019-01-23T17:42:22Z,1,the squiggle line is the best fit line right? which is -3.77. but in the later part of the video you take -6.18 and say it a LL(FIt). But that is LL(overall prob). Why is that so?,True
@jessicatan278,2018-11-25T06:39:23Z,1,and why is it 0.44 and not 0.45 at min 8:37? :'(,True
@jessicatan278,2018-11-25T06:02:13Z,10,why is it 0.55 and not 0.56? at min 6:47,True
@Mona-so9ss,2018-10-15T01:32:24Z,1,what if we have a discrete variable instead of weight? how do we find the best fit then?  also would love to see a video on multiple logistic regression!!,True
@hajer3335,2018-07-23T19:22:28Z,1,"The  data  i'm work in it  makes nonlinear system Ax = y, then i used PSEUDO-INVERSES instead of maximum likelihood to find the parameters that give us a best fitting line. Thus, the pseudo-inverse provides the optimal solution to the least-squares problem. Mr. Josh, What is your opinin? if there is any wrong in my work tell me Please. Thanks in advance.",True
@utsavprabhakar5072,2018-06-29T18:17:54Z,1,Whats R-squared and p ? Do you have a stat quest where ther are explained or mentioned for the first time?,True
@Felicidade101,2018-06-20T21:10:44Z,2,Amazing Thank you Josh!,True
@sharonlee5219,2018-06-20T21:02:05Z,60,I've been binge-watching many of your videos recently to learn more about stats & RNA-Seq and I just wanted to say thank you for all the work you do! these videos are amazing and have been so incredibly helpful in explaining things :),True
@tallwaters9708,2018-06-19T06:26:26Z,7,"Nice stuff as always! If you're still taking video ideas I'd love to see some stuff on Bayesian models, monte carlo, markov chains :)",True
