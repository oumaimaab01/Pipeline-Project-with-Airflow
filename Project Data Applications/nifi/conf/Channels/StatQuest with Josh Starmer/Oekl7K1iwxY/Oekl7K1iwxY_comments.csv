@tannergilliland6105,2024-05-02T00:22:10Z,3,"Hi StatQuest! Have you seen the mamba ssm paper? I would love a stat quest on training and using it. Thanks to your videos I now understand a lot of the basics of machine learning. However when I see all the notation in ML papers, and the mamba paper, I get super confused. So yea, I think it would be awesome if you did a StatQuest on mamba, and maybe you could do a StatQuest on how to understand all those pesky notations.",True
