@ryanzhou5500,2024-02-24T06:21:33Z,0,The replicates are like the GRR in the manufacturing industrial.,True
@eye_oph,2023-11-01T01:07:58Z,0,"If I mixed both biological replicates and technical replicates in the experiments, how should the sample size be determined when comparing the differences between the experimental group and the control group? Should the number of biological replicates be used, or should it be multiplied by the number of technical replicates? Thank you.",True
@priyansharajsinha1159,2023-04-27T09:03:47Z,0,"If sample is coming from different strains of same bacteria in similar conditions, are these biological replicates?",True

@johnbarryyallagher1128,2023-02-06T04:03:45Z,0,how do you combine technical and biological replicate variance if both are of the same order.....or if tech replicate variance is large and could affect the comparisons in the biloical replicates the object if the study,True
@Shinle85,2022-11-30T21:20:24Z,0,Anyone knows a book discussing about these statistics in biology? Thanks in advance,True

@fengtang6433,2021-11-03T08:11:13Z,1,"Hi Josh. Thanks for your video. I am still confused about my case. Recently, I am collecting sample for RNAseq. My sample is pig oocyte. Each week, I can get 10 ovaries from 5 individual pigs (one pig contains two ovaries). Normally, one ovary contains 10-20 healthy oocytes so I can get ~150 oocytes I want each week. For establishing the RNA library, 30 oocytes is required. If I want to have 4 biological repeats (4 repeats need 120 oocytes), can I finish it within one week? Or I should collect 30 oocytes each week and finish sampling 4 weeks later?",True

@erick2051,2021-06-08T00:51:49Z,0,"Hi StatQuest, thanks for the video. It confuses me a bit because in the examples you give of technical replication, seems like an example of pseudoreplication, due to the samples are not independent of each other. Am I right? if not, why? Thank you again.",True
@adithyapbalakrishnan63,2021-04-02T06:01:42Z,2,Thanks StatQuest. Love the way u explain concepts.,True

@chw512,2020-11-05T16:28:00Z,1,"Thanks for the awesome video! I did have a question about technical replicate though. If at day 1, I run an experiment on a sample where I measure the absorbance (measure the absorbance 3 times), is this considered a technical replicate? Or would an example like at day 1, measure the absorbance of a sample 3 times, then day 2 and 3, do the same with the exact sample from day 1, is this considered technical triplicate? So essentially, would measuring the absorbance 3 times be considered technical triplicate in this case or would total of 9 measurements be technical",True

@manochehrteimory9037,2019-10-09T10:36:42Z,1,"Great, if you get into different design of experiments and points, it would be better. I have the same difficulties with my students in our lab, as they do not know what to repeat and do not know the reason for their repetition in a set of experiments",True

@jyeo3900,2019-04-04T03:28:40Z,1,"Hi Josh, Quick Question:  For cell lines, if I were to use only one particular cell line and repeat it. If I have done this experiment 3 times, as compared to having 3 different measurements in 1 experiment. Would that be considered biological replicates for repeating the experiment 3 times?",True
