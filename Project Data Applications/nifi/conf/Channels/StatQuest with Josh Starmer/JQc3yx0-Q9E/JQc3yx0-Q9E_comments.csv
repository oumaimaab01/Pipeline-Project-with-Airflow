@statquest,2020-03-29T16:12:18Z,220,"NOTE: If you are still wondering why we add rarer events to the p-value, consider this: At the start of the video I got 2 heads and though, ""wow! This is special!!!"". However, if I got 2 tails, I would have thought the exact same thing. We tend to think that whatever we see is special, even though there are other events that are just as rare, or rarer. Adding them to the p-value compensates for our observational bias.

@koiRitwikHai,2024-03-29T14:18:30Z,0,"5:11 you are adding the probability of observing something else that is equally rare... isn't it another way of saying ""just double the probability"" ? P(x) + P(y) + P(z) where P(y) = P(x) and P(z) < P(x) so why not 2*P(x) + P(z) ?  or is the following correct formulation of p-value $ p-value = P(x) + \sum_{j}^{J} P(j) + \sum_{k}^{K} P(k) \\ where \\ \forall j \in J; P(j) = P(x) \\ \forall k \in K; P(k) < P(x) \\ J, K \subset S $ you can visualize here https://latexeditor.lagrida.com/  Update: The above logic is incorrect. Rareness is not measured by probability. Sample x is considered as rarer than sample s not because P(x) < P(s). It is considered as rarer because our null hypothesis says so.

Nallu will say, “okay.. That proves my point”. Bob comes and says, “I recovered in 16 days”. Nallu will say, “aaha I was right then”. But then John says, “I recovered in 14 days”. Nallu will say, “huh… that is rare”. Mary comes and says, “I recovered in 11 days”. Nallu will say, “huh… I would still say The superdrug did not help people recover in fewer days.

According to my understanding of the previous video, we can state that a 0.05 threshold in the coin case means that if there is no difference between the coin in question and any other certified regular coin, we are ok with only 5% of experiments producing false positives (the coin is significant due to random factors, maybe wind haha).   So now, a p-value tells us how significant something is by summing the likelihood of the event with just as rare and/or rarer events. Are we saying that we want the significance of the coin event (low p-value) to be higher than our acceptable probability that it was due random chance (our threshold)?",True

Then you add 0.04 (which is the probability of finding someone with height between those ranges) and the left and right parts of these two cutoffs to measure extremes.

For example, we have 3 different hypothesis to test:  Option 1 - My coin is not biased towards Heads (basically we do not care if it is biased towards Tails) Option 2 - My coin is not biased (which is what we  talk about in the video with the coin example) Option 3 - My coin is not biased towards Tails (basically we do not care if it is biased towards Heads)  So, as per my understanding all the above will different p-value for the same experiment outcome, right? Option 1 and Option 3 can be treated as one tail testing and Option 2 is the two tail where we are concerned about both the extremes and rarer events on both sides.  Do let me know your views!

If the coin is two-headed, then the possible outcomes are far different than as shown in the video.  In fact, it would seem that flipping such a coin 5 times would result in HHHHH.

Is this true?

I am not too sure if I understand ""extreme"" correctly.  I guess using an extreme case like a uniform distribution probably can clear my confusion.... What if it was a test for uniform distribution that starts from 0 to 1 with a constant probablity density value of 1. If i got a mean of say 0.3 in my sample, the p-value would be 1 and if the mean of my sample is greater than 1, then the p-value would be 0?  My understanding goes for continous variable, ""more extreme"" refers to the interval whose maximum value of the probablity density function is less than the value of that for population mean (although the value of a single point is meaningless for continous random variables); and for discrete variables, it is simpler - ""more extreme"" refers to any point whose value of probablity mass function less than that of the mean.

Suppose you have two events, A and B, and you wanted to know whether both events had the same contribution to an outcome, or if event A was a main contributor to an outcome rather than event B. What would it mean if we were to set a p-value of 0.001 in a one sided test for example?",True
@statquest,2020-03-29T16:12:18Z,220,"NOTE: If you are still wondering why we add rarer events to the p-value, consider this: At the start of the video I got 2 heads and though, ""wow! This is special!!!"". However, if I got 2 tails, I would have thought the exact same thing. We tend to think that whatever we see is special, even though there are other events that are just as rare, or rarer. Adding them to the p-value compensates for our observational bias.

@ramprasath7363,2020-03-29T14:42:46Z,0,Why are we adding rear and rearer events for p values... Am still finding difficult to grasp,True

@BrianRisk,2020-03-25T20:08:05Z,1,All this talk about four heads and I had to slap my forehead when I realized I've been using one-sided p-values!  D'OH! 🤦‍♂️,True
@JEforever112410,2020-03-25T15:29:49Z,1,"I have a question about the examples using height. With the first example of a height of 142 cm given the distribution, the p-value was calculated looking only at the probability of observing something more extreme. Why do we ignore the probability that we randomly measure someone with a height of 142 cm?  With the second example of a height between 155.4 and 156 cm, we do account for the probability that we randomly measure someone in that range in addition to the probability of observing a more extreme height.",True

@jackfinnegan107,2020-03-25T08:25:12Z,1,"I understand at 22:53 that the Two-Sided p-value still achieved the goal of detecting something unusual happened.  Could there be a case though where you would need to use a One-Sided p-value here? For example, if the One-Sided p-value for 4.5 days was 0.03. Because if you included the other side as well then: p would = 0.03 + 0.03 = 0.06  therefore p > 0.05 therefore it would be incorrectly classed as 'usual'",True
@christinadereklawrence1442,2020-03-24T14:03:48Z,0,"The explanation of p value is confusing.  If the question that is being asked is what is the p-value of obtaining two heads, getting two tails is not equivalent or ""more extreme"" than getting two heads, it is simply a different outcome and not comparable, I don't think its probability should be added.  I think the p value should be 0.25 for two heads.  What am I missing?",True

@fatimahabib1431,2020-03-23T19:57:13Z,0,"thanks alot . i have a question is not it logic to to have that the p_value of the range around the mean is close to one since it is close to the average, so we do not to measure it .cuz logically this distribution will work good for this value !!!
