@statquest,2024-04-25T11:59:12Z,4,"Check out the track on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/4OcFh2yFOTUqzmjjwJF5QY  When I first started making StatQuest videos it never dawned on me that people would try to re-do my math on their own. I was also new to explaining things and just assumed that everyone already knew that, in statistics and machine learning, when you use the log, you use base 'e'. Big rookie mistake! Ever since then, people have been re-doing my math using log base 10 and posting comments about how their math is not working out. Well, this video attempts to explain the discrepancy.
