@hopelesssuprem1867,2023-11-11T16:54:21Z,2,"Many people on the Internet explain regularization of regression using polynomial features in the data that ridge and lasso are allegedly used to reduce the curvature of the line, but in fact in this case you just need to find the right degree of the polynomial. You are one of the few who have shown the real essence of regularization in linear regression and the bottom line is that we simply fine the model by exchanging the bias for a lower variance through slope changes.  By the way, real overfitting in regression can be well observed in data with a large number of features, some of which strongly correlate with each other, as well as a relatively small number of samples, and  in this case that L1/L2/Lasso will be useful.

@--..__,2020-05-27T16:03:03Z,0,L1 and L2 norm are very common phrases. if you aren't familiar with them that is on you... They are much more clear language as it makes it immediately clear that this is just a distance defined by whichever norm you are using in your space. calling it square or absolute value obfuscates the fact that it is a norm and not some other motivation.,True

@afaisaladhamshaazi7519,2020-05-21T07:56:49Z,6,I was wondering why I missed out on this video while going through the ones on Ridge and Lasso Regression from Sept-Oct 2018.  Then I noticed this is a video you put out only a few days ago. Awesome. Much gratitude from Malaysia. 🙇,True
@RAJATTHEPAGAL,2020-05-21T01:32:08Z,0,"L2= weight penalisation (smooths out weight losss curve but and reduces overfitting , but higher lambda can kill model training)  L1 = weight imputation (dragging it to zero, useful for learnable ignoring of variables, useful for high dimensional data at times) . I have used both of these earlier with similar mindset. Earlier even in Deep Learning i used a similar analogy to reason about what was happening. The visualisation really did helped, so just wanted to know is this simplistic way of viewing the behaviour makes sense ??? Or am I missing something ....",True

@vijayendrasdm,2020-05-19T16:14:26Z,0,"Hi Josh Thanks for the amazing video. I have few queries/require clarification 1. Lasso Regression is a convex loss function, but it is not differential at certain points (optimal points)? Is this correct? 2. In the example at  lambda = 40, the weight of the feature becomes zero.  If I have to think of intuition in  higher dimension,  if we start with 5 features(F1,F2,F3,F4,F5) and lambda=0, The optimal would correspond to some non-zero weights. Now if I start applying regularization,  i.e increase lambda, lets say lamda=10. Then subset of weights might go to zero , what could we say about the kink here ?",True
@omnesomnibus2845,2020-05-19T15:57:36Z,3,"Really excellent video Josh. You consistently do a great job, and I appreciate it. Could you make a video showing the use of Ridge regression and especially Lasso regression in parameter selection? I had to do that once, and it is complicated. From your example it seems that using neither penalty gives you the best response. So, in what circumstances do you want to use the regression to improve your result? If you are using lasso regression to find the top 3 predictive parameters, how does this work? What are the dangers? How do you optimally use it? A complicated subject for sure! I'm sorry if this is covered in your videos on Lasso and Ridge regression individually, I am watching them next. I agree with your naming convention btw, squared and absolute-value penalty is MUCH more intuitive!",True

@arjunpukale3310,2020-05-19T06:48:42Z,1,And thats the reason why lasso does a kind of feature selection and sets many weights to 0 compared to ridge regression.  And now I know the reason behind it thanks a lot❤,True
