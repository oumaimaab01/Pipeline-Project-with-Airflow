@achrefcherif6824,2022-10-28T09:53:03Z,1,Rolling the pasta in the machine several times with different levels of thickness really looks like adjusting a neural network parameters until finding the right thickness (weight). Is this a coincidence?!!  because If it's not just woow/Baaam !,True

@esepecesito,2022-10-25T18:55:27Z,2,"For the metric folks:¬† 100g Flour for each egg.¬†(1 egg + 100g flour is conveniently one ""normal"" pasta portion) Salt 8g per litre of water. The time in the fridge is not strictly necessary. I never do it. I use the the thicker setting to avoid work, after a little bit of mixing the eggs and the flour, I pass it several times through the machine to achieve a nice texture. Then proceed as explained, each time finer. Cooking time depends strongly on thickness of pasta: from 3-4 minutes for real thing, to 10 min for thick pasta.",True
