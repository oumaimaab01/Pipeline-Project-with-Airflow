On a serious note, your videos are awesome and have helped me (and so many others) wirh their studies, and it's incredible how such a simple method of teaching (using what I can only assume to be PowerPoint slides) to make analogies that even little kids could understand.

God damn people don't even give their 50% at 300k USD salaries.. you make no sense. You are truly unexplainable. What it means to be human is something one can learn from you. Your insane effort to help others can cure people of depression and sorrow, not to mention also make them ultra top tier ML engineers. But your expertise aside, you have an insanely big heart man. You are peak human. Thankyou for existing",True

Can you please make a video on Bayesian optimization that is used as an alternative for gridsearchcv and randomsearchcv . Its confusing as to what prior and posterior distributions mean and also how does Bayesian optimization works... Because in company interviews that's the fancy thing they look for... Meaning how did you do it using a probabilistic model... It would be great if you could make a video on Bayesian optimization and also maybe have a python code showing how can we do it using some open source packages. Thank you.
