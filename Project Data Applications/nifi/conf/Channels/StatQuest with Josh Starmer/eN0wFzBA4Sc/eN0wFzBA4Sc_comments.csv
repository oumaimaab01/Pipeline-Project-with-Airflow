@Murphyalex,2022-03-15T10:36:33Z,1,Great video (as always). You might want to calm it down with the BAMs though.

@junaidbutt3000,2022-02-25T11:23:34Z,3,"Hey Josh,  Great work as always, this StatQuest came at a great time for me because I've been looking into UMAP myself. I had a few questions apologies if they're covered in the mathematical details video:  1. Is there an additional constraint for the curve used to compute the high dimensional similarity score to make the scores what they are? In the example where you computed the distance of points B and C relative to A, you had 1.0 and 0.6. This is because the scores must sum to 1.6. But why not 1.3 and 0.3 or 1.59 and 0.01? Is there an additional consideration which locks them to be 1.0 and 0.6?   2. Will there be an explanation about spectral embedding? This may be outside of the scope of the video but I thought I'd ask!  3. Could you please check my understanding for what is happening when we move point D closer to point E? The discussion starts at 14:48 in the video. As I understand it, moving D closer to E (we want this) also moves D closer to C (we don't want this). So we compute a tradeoff and find that the cost of moving D closer to C is lower than the benefit of moving D closer to E. Therefore we move D to E. Is this correct? If so, is there an equation or rule that allows us to quantify this such that we can determine the exact distance to move D closer to E?  I suspect that most of these will be included in the mathematical details follow up video but I thought I'd ask just in case they aren't.",True
