@statquest,2020-01-08T19:07:07Z,42,"Corrections: 8:53 I meant to say ""the remaining 198.7 people without the mutated gene"". 14:27 I correctly wrote ""If the tests worked as expected, 5% should have p-values less than 0.05"". That is correct. However, when recording the voiceover, I said ""5% should have p-values less than 0.5"", which is not correct.  NOTE: In statistics, machine learning and computer programming, the default base for the log() function is 'e'. Thus, throughout this video I use the natural logarithm, or log base 'e', to do the calculations.

@nikunj2554,2020-10-06T00:04:14Z,0,"Hello Josh, I had a confusion at 12:02 in the video. You said that the - ""Wald's test typically uses the estimated standard deviation"" ; but in reality we replaced the histogram with the normal curve having standard deviation of the observed values i.e 0.47. Hence, shouldn't it be - ""Wald's test typically uses the observed standard deviation"" instead of the expected and then we have a normal curve of STD=0.47 at 12:02. Based on my understanding the expected standard deviation will come from the earlier matrix of expected values which we calculated and here we have used the observed values matrix for getting a STD of 0.47. Let me know if I am missing something, but I am kind of lost in this section of the video and could use your help. Thanks again for an amazing video.",True

@mostinho7,2020-05-07T07:04:02Z,0,Odds of something is itself a ratio (probability of it happening/probability of it not happening) The odds are usually odds of x given y (in this case the odds of getting cancer given that you do have a gene)  Log odds ratio is a ratio of ratios (ratio of the log odds) but the given condition changes. This tells us if the “given” condition has an effect on the odds of x happening.  Example: 3:40 Log odds ratio = (log odds of getting cancer | you have the gene) / (log odds of getting cancer | you don’t have the gene) This can tell us the effect of the given condition (given you have the gene vs given you don’t have the gene) on the odds of x happening (cancer vs no cancer),True

@dainegai,2019-10-23T06:19:38Z,3,"Great stuff as usual :)  I was curious about the seemingly magical estimator for the standard deviation for the log(odds_ratio). Judging from the CrossValidated post here (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/266098/how-do-i-calculate-the-standard-deviation-of-the-log-odds), this comes from assuming that the count data for each cell was drawn from a Poisson distribution. Does that sound right to you? If so, how do you ""make sense"" of this assumption/what it means? I usually intuitively think of a Poisson distribution as ""a Binomial distribution with a whole bunch (infinite number) of trials and a super small (infinitesimal rate) of success"", and I'm having trouble understanding what the ""whole bunch of trials"" or ""super small probability of success"" would mean for a cell in a two-way table.   (I'm also kind of blown away by the fact that the log(odds_ratio) is distributed Normally. From what I understand, this comes from the theory behind Generalized Linear Models, but sadly I haven't seen the part that explains why the natural parameters, e.g. log(odds_ratio) for Bernoulli response/logistic regression, ends up actually being distributed Normally. If you have any intuition/references on this, I'd appreciate them, but I don't mean to flood you with a ton of questions.
