@Azazello1482,2023-11-29T19:31:14Z,0,"Hi, thanks for these videos! I'm confused by the logic of what happens at 1:20, when you split the data using 15 lines that occur at the points themselves. Wouldn't the intuitive thing to do be to cut the _space_ so each point resides in its own piece, rather than to use the data (i.e., the demarcations) as the cut points? In other words, you need only 14 lines to slice this data space into portions that each contain a single point. When this is then repeated on the standard normal distribution curve, wouldn't we then want to slice that curve into n equal pieces using n-1 cuts (not make n cuts resulting in n+1 equal pieces)?  Edit to add one more question. I feel like I mostly get it, but I'm fuzzy on the intuition that underpins why this all works. Is it enough for the line to be straight, or must it also be at a 45-degree angle? I see how we're graphically connecting the data to the standard normal distribution, but I'm not certain as to what the intuitive connection is. It feels like it has something to do with calculus---that we're trying to compare the rates of change between quantiles for both our data and the data in a known distribution to ensure that they are constant and in lockstep.",True

@yashsaxena139,2023-07-27T21:01:28Z,0,I maybe wrong here but I used qqplot to judge if a dataset with 4.3M rows is normal or not and the plot came out to be almost a vertical line which suggests whilst values on yaxis are increasing quantile wise but values on x-axis are increasing very very marginally less causing the line to be a vertical line.

I had a doubt in the previous Quantiles & Percentiles video, and now when seeing the normal quantiles, it further aggravated. In the first case, are you taking the first data-point as the 6.25th quantile or 0th quantile, because if I consider the 1st data-point, given your definition in the earlier video, you said it is 0th quantile in the second part. In that case, on the normal distribution, -3.99 should be the normal quantile, isn't it? How come is it -1.5? I am coming to -1.5 if I consider the 1st data point as the 6.25th quantile, only then would the 4th data point also be 25th quantile, otherwise it is the 20th quantile. I am highly confused.

@Dekike2,2018-12-05T11:51:02Z,6,"Hi!!! Great video!!!! It was very helpful to understand Q-Q Plots!!!! But just one question, how do you calculate the quantiles for your dataset?? I mean, the first observation of your dataset is 0.6, but I don't understand why, since the first observation leaves 0 observations on one of its sides. Should the quantile be 0? In the video where you explain how to calculate quantiles, you explained that the quantile for each observation is calculated dividing the number of observations that this value leaves below between the total number of observations... So, for the first point... 0/15 = 0. Why 0.6??",True

My interpretation of the video is that a q-q plot should return values that fit perfectly on y = x.  However because of the scale of my data, surely this isn't true. Rather is it that we can say that they will fit some line y = x + C(arbitrary constant)? Not even sure if I'm right about this haha...  Is this the latter the correct interpretation?
