@70amazed,2022-08-04T21:22:17Z,0,"1. The process at 3:47 necessitates assuming a standard deviation for all the candidate distributions, correct? 2. When we say MLE mean and MLE standard deviation, do both of these always refer to the same distribution, i.e., the distribution that maximizes the likelihood?   In other words, we can find the MLE mean and the MLE standard deviation in either order, since both the MLE mean and MLE standard deviation refer to the same distribution, the MLE distribution. The order in which we maximize does not matter. Are there distributions for which this is not the case?",True

@savvaskefalas5635,2017-11-07T17:13:34Z,0,"Reading the comments,especialy by ---CainisUponUs and Travis Greene I expanded my horizon linking bayes and sample size with the MLE.Do you have a problem to actually post the algorithms of those two commenters?1)how many times I had to conduct an experiment to produce a statistically significant result?I knew the precission algorithm that produces a sample size but i am new to the MLE 2)How is bayes involved with the MLE (I know the basics of repeated evidence but since MLE is more advanced I'd like to understand that too(possibly some links would be enough if it is too much to ask in the comments or if you plan to explore this in a later video)",True
@savvaskefalas5635,2017-11-07T17:04:03Z,0,I find the video very valuable...Great work!!! However my understanding is impeded due to the fact that i do not realize the mathematical equivalent of 'observing the data.What calculation is behind that?,True
@leonleon246,2017-11-06T17:19:05Z,1,Crystal... thanks,True
@TheSkullCrossbone,2017-10-27T18:14:27Z,0,Are there cases where the maximum likelihood is not at the average of the shape we calculated before? For me it seems to be redundant respectively obvious not to do it in one row.,True

@georgewang7770,2017-10-13T16:51:29Z,0,Fantastic.  Thank you.,True
@iloveno3,2017-10-06T21:02:50Z,0,Is probability and likelihood the same thing?,True
@reytns1,2017-09-23T11:29:29Z,0,"Hey... you are amazon, I have a question related to Maximum likelihood, what is the difference with restricted maximum likelihood?",True
@haritimatiwari1364,2017-09-22T13:58:43Z,0,great help  !!!!,True
@kwikstah,2017-09-20T16:40:26Z,0,You said that the reason you want to fit a distribution to your data is it can be easier to work with and it is also more general. Could you expand on that? Thanks.,True
@satish.b,2017-09-06T17:47:31Z,0,"Whats the difference between maximum likelihood fit and simply computing the mean/SD of the observed data? Obviously, the best fit would be the mean and SD for the observed data.",True
@__ihexx__5654,2017-08-27T09:53:47Z,0,First time seeing one of your vids. That intro though; that it was trolling,True
@Zolarmew,2017-08-26T17:56:39Z,1,"doesn't it mean that the bigger the std of the distribution, the closer the values will appear to its mean implying better likelihood?...",True
@Ivaniushina,2017-08-24T07:48:19Z,0,"clearly explained indeed. Thank you !   Are you planning to talk about other estimators, like WLSM for categorical data ?  what is the difference between MLM and MLR?",True
@ThinkingRockh,2017-08-23T07:22:18Z,0,"Gold content. Can't find anyone on YouTube really try to explain the phrase ""maximum likelihood"". Thank you so much!",True

@SuperNishant92,2017-08-02T06:40:45Z,0,"Hey Joshua, I love the simplicity of your videos. Can you make one on Decision trees and Random Forests sometime? I find them a bit too complex :)",True
@urjaswitayadav3188,2017-08-02T03:58:05Z,0,"Thanks Joshua for this video! Really helpful. I would love to see another one on the same subject with the details of how we can apply the MLE on a real dataset.  A quick question - for a real world problems, do we need to have an idea of the distribution that we want to fit? Or is there a way to estimate the distribution first and then apply MLE to fit the parameters to the data. Thanks again for taking the time to do this!",True
@CainisUponUs,2017-08-01T22:24:57Z,0,"Such amazing timing! One of my mathematically inclined friends just told me that we could use maximum likelihood to determine how many times I had to conduct an experiment to produce a statistically significant result, but I had no idea what she was talking about till I saw this!",True
@simonchan2394,2017-08-01T06:36:37Z,0,Thanks for the vid - am I correct in saying that the maximum likelihood is just the best fitting distribution over a set of data?,True
@lilmoesk899,2017-08-01T02:07:13Z,2,"Nice choice of topic! Thank you. Am I correct in assuming that MLE will be different for different distributions due to differences in tuneable parameters? In other words, for fitting a normal distribution to a set of a data using MLE, we need to estimate values for the mean and standard deviation; but for, say, an exponential distribution, we need to also estimate the skewness to fully describe it. Is that roughly correct? Some suggestions for future videos: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th moments and moment generating functions, conditional expectation, connections between linear regression and ANOVA, the law of the unconscious statistician, probit analysis, Markov processes, time series analysis, use of partial derivatives in interpreting probabilities in logistic regression. Thanks again!",True
@zebasultana930,2017-07-31T21:07:02Z,0,"Hey Joshua,  your videos are very nice and explained very well... Thanks so much !!!  Could you please do a slightly more advanced video on this topic using an example data set and the probability equations etc .. that will be very very helpful !",True
