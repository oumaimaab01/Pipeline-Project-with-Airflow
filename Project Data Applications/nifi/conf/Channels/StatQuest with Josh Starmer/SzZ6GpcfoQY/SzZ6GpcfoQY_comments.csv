@nbernard71,2022-07-04T15:14:42Z,0,Hi Josh and thanks for your awesome videos. One question on this one. It's like population measurements = sample measurements = n.  But sample measurements = 5 in your example while population measurements = 240 billions. Shouldn't we use N for population measurement number (240 billions) and n for sample one (5).  5:04 => population variance is used with n = 240 billions 9:46 => estimated variance is used with n = 5 9:00 => this is where I'm confused with the inequality. Is it the same n at the right and the left? Or n = 5 for estimated (left side) and n = 240 billions for calculated (right side)?,True

Quick question - would all the math be the same for a ""population"" of values that were both positive and negative?  For example, daily change in temperatures above and below a mean?  In that case, would negative values go off to the left for values below the mean and positive values go to the right for values above the mean?  But otherwise the mean daily change would be the center of the curve (assuming normal distribution)?  Variance average of the differences squared?  And 1 SD the square root of the variance?

We square the differences to make sure there isn't any negative term and in the end do a square root to finally get the standard deviation. As it turns out, in the middle of this we have termed the squared result as Variance. I do not understand why we needed Variance at all? SD was what we were looking for and SD helps us understand how spread out the curve will be. Then Why Variance is needed at all? (Otherwise we could also raise the differences to the power of 4 and name the result something fancy like Ultra-Variance, and then fourth root of Ultra-Variance would be our SD)",True

In such a case you would have multiple sample means, and multiple sample standard deviations.  It feels like you should be able to aggregate all the different sample means and sample deviation calculations somehow to get an even more accurate estimation of the population mean and STD.  In your video you describe how your estimated accuracy would increase if you increase the number of green dots used in your calculations. However, what do you do when don’t necessarily have more green dots to use, but have multiple sample estimations of the mean and STD?  Thanks again for all of your help! 🙏",True
