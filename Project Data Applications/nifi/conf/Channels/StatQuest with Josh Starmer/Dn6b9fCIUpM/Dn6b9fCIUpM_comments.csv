@zongyili4629,2024-05-28T07:32:52Z,0,"Thank you for the informative video. I have a question about estimating parameters in statistical analysis. Could you explain the difference between: Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate the parameters of a normal distribution, where the variance formula includes n in the denominator, and Calculating an unbiased estimate of the population variance from a sample, where n‚àí1 is used in the denominator? Both methods use measurements to estimate the parameters of the population from which the measurements are derived, yet they approach the calculation of variance differently. This can be confusing.

@Iamfafafel,2024-04-20T20:11:19Z,0,i still dont see why taking the equation for critical points give you maximum and not e.g. minima,True
@Iamfafafel,2024-04-20T20:03:15Z,0,"log, or more generally any strictly mono increasing function g preserves (and introduces no new) critical points and extrema.   let g' > 0, then        0 = (g‚àòf(x))'= g'(f(x)) f'(x)   therefore, the cp of g‚àòf occurs at the cp of f. for extrema, x is a max (local or global, just take appropriate y), then        f(x) ‚â• f(y) ‚Üí g‚àòf(x) ‚â• g‚àòf(y)  since this is over the same neighborhood y, preservation of extrema follows.  amazing how such a basic property gets overlooked",True

@geogeo14000,2021-08-21T15:37:44Z,0,"Amazing. Just to be sure, when you talk about a measurement, it should be p(weight > or < value) and never p(weight == value) as it is always equal to 0 here as it is a probability with density function ? And why can't we find sigma with only one measurement, is it because the deviation only has meaning when we have at least two different points  ?   Another thing related to these questions I'm a little bit puzzled by is the way the curves are plot over the data points when we say it is the maximum likelihood. For a mouse to have a weight of 32 or more precisely p(weight <= 32) when the mean is 32, the probability is 50% as the area under the curves is half covered. But if we put the mean ridiculously low like 5 grams, it means that when we reach 32 grams we have covered almost all the area under the curve and p(weight <= 32) = 1. So following this logic, the data points should always be put on the far right of the graph, where the area (= the probability to see these measurements) is the highest because close to one ? I'm sorry I'm a bit confused, maybe again it is because we reason with p(weight == 32) whereas I thought it was always 0. Or are the probabilities of the measurements in reality something like p(x - eps <= x <= x + eps) ?   Thank you very much",True

@kittyxing,2020-11-09T22:56:14Z,0,"Thanks so much for the video, it is so great! I do have a question regarding to the derivation of max likelihood of Sigma (around 18:40). I have the impression that the mu on the right side of the formula should be the mean of distribution in the assumption instead of the mean of measured points (x1,x2...). I'm confused when you mentioned the formula is actually the STD since in the STD formula, the mu should be the mean of measured points. Is it safe to simply treat those two values the same? The other related question is that, do we suppose to search the global minimum in a two dimension surface defined by (mu, sigma)? If we only search mu and sigma one by one in a one dimension way, will it promise to give us the global optimal solution? Thanks again and so love your video!",True

@peshalgoel7414,2020-04-06T12:57:41Z,0,"Referring to 4:41  Because when we have only one measurement (X) and calculate maximum likelihood estimate for ¬µ, keeping œÉ and¬†X as constants, will result in ¬µ = X. Then we will calculate maximum likelihood estimate for œÉ, keeping X and ¬µ as constants. Here X = ¬µ = 32 (in the above example). If we plot the likelihood (Y-Axis) against different values of œÉ (X-Axis), we will get a decreasing exponential curve (not sure that it will be exponential, but it will always have a negative slope) and the point corresponding to maximum likelihood will have slope¬†‚âà infinity or a negative slope with an unknown magnitude. Therefore when we will take the derivative of the likelihood function with X and ¬µ as constants, we will have to solve for derivative ‚âà infinity/negative slope with an unknown magnitude.  The slope will be infinity if the curve is exponential. It will be a negative slope of unknown magnitude, if the curve is any other ever decreasing curve. In both the cases, we will not be able to solve the equation.  PS: Intuitively, it feels like it will be an exponential curve with negative slope.  Please correct me if I am wrong!",True

What would fundamentally change if one would take the product of the propabilities instead and optimize this? It would basically follow the same logic.

@socratic-programmer,2019-04-07T20:58:12Z,0,"You say that we need more than 1 measurement to find an optimal value for sigma - but surely in the degenerate case of a single data point, the normal distribution that best fitted that point is mu = value of point and sigma tends towards 0? In that case, it would resemble a straight vertical line at that point.  Which brings me onto the next example you give straight afterwards. Assuming each of the 3 data points are weighted equally, and the mean is fixed at the middle point, wouldn't a standard deviation of approx 0 give a likelihood of 1/3 because it accounts for that one point perfectly but not the other 2?   EDIT: Oh, they're independent. So in the case where sizeof(X) > 1 the likelihood of the other 2 points would be 0 and then the overall likelihood is 0. Makes sense for the second paragraph then, but the first question still stands.",True
