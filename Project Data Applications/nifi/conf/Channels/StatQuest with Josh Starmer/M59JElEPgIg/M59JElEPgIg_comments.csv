@weipenghu4463,2024-05-01T03:44:20Z,1,I love you used 'hard core' to describe guys watching this video.,True
@sachink9102,2024-02-26T03:39:53Z,0,Excellent Series !!! . I think for Regression use case you can try a Different example. Drug dosage example looks like classification Problem and there we used SSR as loss function. Like iris Flowers Example was perfect for Classification Problem,True

@hugocontreras2848,2023-05-30T23:58:52Z,0,"I see there is an error in the multiplication of -Psetosa and Pversicolor in 5:57, the correct value would be -0.069, not -0.07. Anyway, thank you for the video, it was most useful! you are doing a great favor to this world with these series <3",True

@lekanswansons3646,2021-03-15T10:11:03Z,1,So do you add all the 3 probabilities together when you get the derivatives assuming the results for all three predicted outcomes are matrices. Simply put do you need all 3 derivatives or just the derivative of the output you are predicting.,True
@sanskarshrivastava5193,2021-03-14T07:34:45Z,1,Statquest should be declared as Universal Treasure !,True

@steelcitysi,2021-02-19T06:14:37Z,0,Great video as usual! In one of your earlier videos you referred to Elements of Statistical Learning as the Bible of machine learning. This text is comparatively light on NNs. Do you have a Bible for NNs that you would recommend?,True
@nonalcoho,2021-02-16T17:19:03Z,1,"Thank you for the derivative! I want to ask a question at 6:30 that after we calculated the 0.21/-0.07/-0.15, what is the next step of this network? I mean at which part will this network utilize  0.21/-0.07/-0.15? Thank you for reading my question!",True
@renjiehu9231,2021-02-15T16:08:30Z,7,"Josh, thanks for these great videos, it really helps a lot for me and so many others who like machine learning! I think you make great videos teaching people about the ideas, but I really hope there can be more videos on how to code under these knowledges. I think it will be wonderful if your videos combine coding and theory together.",True
