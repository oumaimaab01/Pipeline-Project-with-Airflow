I've been following your statistics playlist serially as it is available. Till this point , I only have one doubt that sampling a distribution means selecting a small cluster of data points from the whole sample and do experiments on them .   Is it similar to cross validation like our model is evaluated on different set of data so that it is more generalised . Similarly if we have large amount of data even these computation and graph plotting will be heavy tasks for computer so therefore we experiment on small datasets because it will be very good approximation of generaized or whole population because it's been proven by statistics (as you have shown in these videos) hence working on subset of the large datasets won't affect our end results ?????
