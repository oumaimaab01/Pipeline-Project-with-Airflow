I'd like to request an eli5 on ZDDs(Zero-Supressed Decision Diagrams, I understand has more to do with CS than stats) and their applications to statistics.",True
@Han-ve8uh,2020-11-03T11:03:52Z,0,"I wish law of total probability was introduced to show how the denominator can be split to multiple terms and that one of these terms is exactly the numerator. That would be clearer than just portraying the denominator as 'scaling'. This was a key insight in helping me think intuitively when learning Bayes Theorem. At 29:00 you mentioned its possible for likelihood to go over 1, and this denominator makes sure it never happens, however isn't the denominator a probability which is 0-1? How can a denominator capped at 1 scale down something bigger than 1 in numerator? Or this whole video is for discrete/multinomial naive bayes and likelihoods only appear in continuous gaussian naive bayes? How would the denominator look like in gaussian NB? (i couldn't find any mention of denominator in the gaussian NB video)",True

@taotaotan5671,2020-05-28T05:13:40Z,0,"Thanks for a clear explanation, Josh.  I have a question here: As you mentioned in the video, we usually can't measure the whole population. Instead, what we can do is to measure the sample and give a reasonable estimation to the population. Here is my question: the less sample we have, the estimation will be less reliable. Are there any methods to quantify this ""confidence""?    Thanks again for the wonderful video.",True

@ccuuttww,2020-05-20T02:27:19Z,0,"I told u that 90 % people don't understand The core of Bayesian theorem even they allow to calculate the answer with formula In Bayesian theorem everything is about ""subjective"" followed by sampling more data to reinforce or nerf your guesseS  yes it is guesseS guesseS it the most important part",True
