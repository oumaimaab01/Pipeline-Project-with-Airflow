@zhaowu3193,2022-08-03T09:45:11Z,0,Thank you for this simple yet illustrative example pf quantile normalization. I would like to know what happened if we have missing values in some of the samples. Can we still do the quantile normalization ?,True

@shubha1Ana2,2022-06-24T15:23:01Z,0,"Hello Sir, I have a doubt. Is image segmentation for finding size, shape , pleomorphism of nuclei always necessary to classification of H&E WSI? If we you deep learning networks, can we pass HE images( may be rescaled) as it is without segmentation? Kindly answer if possible",True
@leesweets4110,2022-02-08T15:29:55Z,0,"And if the data sets in each sample have different numbers of genes?  How do you quantile normalize between sets of different sizes?  My first thought before starting the real explanation of this video...  was that we'd simply scale and shift the data in each sample according to their own standard deviations and means.  This would preserve order, fix the means, and preserve relative instensities within each sample.",True

I'm very new to bioinformatics / statistics; I've been provided with a massive RNASeq dataset, and I've no idea if the data is quantile normalised or not. Do you know of any handy way I can check to see if quantile normalisation has been performed?",True

@danielwiczew,2020-12-24T11:08:37Z,0,"A question: couldn't we just normalize the data in the y axis, by turning it into 0 mean and 1 variance? Then the scale on the y axis would be 0 ... 1.",True

@mpat53,2020-06-04T17:39:03Z,0,"HI John, I have a question 1) I have been provided with a table of quantile normalized read data (RNA seq). I want to progress using the program IDEP online . Should I enter this data as 'read count data' or as 'normalised expression values eg RNA seq FPKM, microarray etc' I think it's the second one as it is quantile normalised but I'm not fully sure as it's not FPKM.. thanks",True

@dorjexx,2020-04-23T10:39:44Z,0,"Thank you, Josh. BUT, I got a question about 'BUT': at the end of the video, you said: ""after quantile normalization, the values for each sample are the same... BUT, the original gene orders are preserved.""   if the values are the same, the orders are the same, right? So, why use 'but'?",True

@jdm89s13,2019-02-25T00:42:29Z,1,"So what if I have microarray data for different cohorts, and I am not worried about the specific intensity values, but just want to compare gene expression level across cohorts (i.e. which samples express a certain gene high versus those which express it low)? Would quantile normalization be a valid way to scale the data prior to clustering?",True

@ai1888,2018-04-20T01:02:19Z,0,"At 3:32, one thing I noticed is that the the red colored gene for samples 1 and 3 now have the exact same intensity values. In reality this is almost certainly not true. I notice this a lot when performing RMA for microarrays where Quantile normalization compresses smaller fold change differences. Is this just a caveat of the normalization method we just have to accept?",True
