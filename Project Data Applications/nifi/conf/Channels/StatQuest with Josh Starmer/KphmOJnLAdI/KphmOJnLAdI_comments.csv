@colekeircom,2024-04-17T10:07:32Z,1,"As an electronics hobbyist/student from way back in the 70s I like to keep up as best  I can with technology. I'm really glad I  don't have to remember all the details in this series. There are so many layers upon layers that at times I do ''just keep going to the end'' of the videos. Nevertheless I still manage to learn key aspects and new terms from your excellent teaching abilities. There must be an incredible amount of work involved in creating these lessons.  I will purchase your book because you deserve some form of appreciation  and it'll serve as a great reference resource. Much respect Josh and thanks , Kieron.",True

@DmitryPesegov,2024-04-08T20:31:54Z,0,"Great details. But. Please. In the education process it's very important to use some imaginable concepts as a frameworks. For me it's hard to connect why we are doing all that digits with the goal and why it works. Start using the concept of a n-sphere (let it be just a 2D circle, since we are using 2 values for tokens) and explain that we are actually rotating the whole n-spheres (circles) with packed Q and K in them and coding-in cases of different co-directionality of vectors measured by the cosine similarity [-1..1] (and actually divided not by mult of 2-norms but by sqrt of dmnsnlty just for comp.performance (you successfully mentioned this)). And when we are multiplying by V - we are actually doing the ""mixing"" of values in each dimension wrt QK co-directionality as a vectors in a n-sphere. We rotating the n-spheres by multiplying Q and K by matrices Wq and Wk and when we are doing that it's actually works as a rotation, linear transformation can do more but we will use the cosine similarity after it to measure the alignment of the vectors Q and K. Rotations, co-directionality cases code-ins, mixing. Repeat.",True
