@daniloimparato,2022-11-20T00:49:11Z,1,"This one was a little tougher for me to grasp...  At 14:51, is each sample of the sample pairs composed of 3 measurements? I'm guessing from the arrows.  I'm trying to wrap my head around the ""10 genes not affected"" part of that sentence.  Does that actually mean ""10 measurements not affected by the drug""? In that case, each sample of the sample pairs would be composed of 10 measurements, contradicting the arrows?  Actually, I am not sure I understand the composition of the blue curve. I reckon it represents measurements from 10k different genes in multiple cells, right? A population of different genes in a population of cells. It feels to me equivalent to generating a distribution of sizes of 10k different body parts in a population of humans. That is, just like gene A and gene B contribute to a single curve, the size of ears and toenails would also contribute to a single curve, which sounds weird to me.

@TaylanMorcol,2022-10-25T19:39:08Z,1,"Hi Dr. Josh, I'm curious to get your thoughts on a simulation I'm running. It's very similar to the simulation in this video where you calculate 10,000 p-values by sampling from the same distribution.   When I run my simulation using a Welch t-test and n=3, only ~3.5% of p-values are less than 0.05. The percentage converges on 5% when I increase the sample size or use the Student's t-test.   It seems as though forgoing the equal variances assumption sacrifices some power, especially at low sample sizes. But I'm still trying to grasp why that is and what the implications are for using the Welch t-test with low sample size in real-life situations. For example, if the null hypothesis is that both samples come from the same population, then why not just assume equal variances and use Student's t-test all the time? (I know that last question is probably conflating some concepts that should be separate, but I'm having a hard time keeping track of it all, and I'm really interested to hear how you would respond to that question).  You seem to have a great way of explaining things like this intuitively. I'm curious to hear your thoughts.  Thanks so much! I've benefited greatly from your videos.",True

At 10:09 of the video, you considered an experiment being performed on active neuronal cells. Assuming each cell has 10000 genes in it and we have 20 such cells each with 10000 genes, our experimental setup is say 10 cells treated with drug and 10 cells not. When you mentioned that drug might affect 1000 genes, then why do we have 2 separate distributions? Why do we have a control distribution and another one treated with a drug distribution, when all we should be concerned are the cells treated with the drug (aka drug affected distribution vs non-drug affected distribution). Can you help me understanding it. More specifically, are the 1000 genes distributed amongst all the cells given the drug?",True

@ohbennyboy,2019-04-16T10:18:00Z,0,"Hi, I don't understand (@17:07). The adjusted first p-value (0.1 - no longer significant) is independent to all the previous p-values and is only dependent on the number of genes. Your example shows one ""false positive"" and the rest are not significant, yet the result would be exactly the same even if all the other values are below 0.05. This is because you're calculation is independent of the other p-values. So really, explaining the calculations for p-values ranked 2-10 is redundant, the adjusted p-value will almost always be greater than 0.05.  In an example of proteomics where there are 3500 proteins analysed, to consider a p-value really significant according to your FDR principle, the p-values which could be considered true positives would have to be 0.000014 or lower.  Obviously that's silly. As there would be a large amount of false positives, only accepting values of 0.000014 or lower would exclude many true positives also.  A reply would be much appreciated.",True

Benjamini-Hochberg will find that the samples with the lowest p-values are significant after adjustment. But doesn't Bonferroni do that as well? What exactly about the rank-based BH algorithm makes it specifically control the FDR and take into account the proportion of p < 0.05 which are thought to come from the uniform distribution? I imagine that it is more sophisticated than simply a smaller multiplier.  Some thoughts: The highest p-value is assigned rank N. This p-value is not adjusted at all, to p*N/N = p. This seems fine and shouldn't change the FDR ratio if it's already above 0.05. The lowest p-value is assigned rank 1. This p-value is adjusted a lot, to potentially p*N/1. At this point it seems similar to Bonferroni. I don't fully understand what's going on here.  Thanks again for the help!",True
