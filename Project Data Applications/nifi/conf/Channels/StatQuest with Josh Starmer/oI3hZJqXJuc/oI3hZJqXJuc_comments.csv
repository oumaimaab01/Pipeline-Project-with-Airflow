Whenever I ask you reply to me Thank you for that.  I have one question which is bothering me a lot.  During probability distribution examples we have given parameters of distributions in our examples.  So my questions are: 1. In the real world we don't have given parameters with us, we always have sample data with us? So how we get that given parameters in real world scenario.  2. As in question 1 i said we always have sample data with us not the entire population but in the probability distribution function we are passing parameters like mu and Sigma in case of normal probability distribution, so those parameters are population parameters or estimated population parameters from sample data?  Thank you in advance",True

@samwinchester1580,2019-09-11T23:51:23Z,2,so as I looked at this I tried to figure out why someone just wouldn't use a line graph or such. Then I realized that maybe an important thing to mention is that this histograph is only measuring one characteristic and not 2. So we are not measuring age and height as having some sort of relationship where as you get older your height goes up. But we are just finding how often a certain range of one particular characteristic occurs. If my assumption is correct would this be a good thing to mention in the video? Also would you ever attach some questions along with each video to help provoke thought?,True
