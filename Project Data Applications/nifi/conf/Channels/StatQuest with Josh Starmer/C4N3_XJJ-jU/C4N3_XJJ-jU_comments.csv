@mueezwaq,2023-09-21T08:21:37Z,1,"Hi Josh Firstly many thanks for your videos on this topic. I have noticed very odd and conflicting results between R and SPSS with regards to entering factors (with more than 1 level) into a logistic regression model. SPSS produces a simplified output containing an odds ratio with 95% CI and p-value, for each individual variable entered into a logistic regression model (rather than the factor levels, as displayed in R).  In R - I have not found a good way to do this. I have used the logistic.display command as well as exp() to get odds ratios, but they do not provide an overall value like in SPSS (instead, listing these for each individual level within the factor). Do you have any idea why SPSS and R handle logistic regression differently like this? All I would like is a similar output to SPSS - where I get a single odds ratio, 95% CI and p-value for each individual factor variable entered.",True

I just want to get verified how to choose the right distribution   First, to choose the right distribution, the distribution we choose such as normal distribution reflect the distribution of the target variable (i.e. data point).  Second, the distribution of prediction errors (i.e. error = the difference between the y and y^) has to appear  to be normally distributed, if you choose the normal distribution. If you are using binomial distribution, the distribution of prediction errors has to appear to be binomially distributed.

Should you remove one of them? Because they're all parameters that are either 0 or 1 right? If cp3 is 0,57... does that mean you can remove only that one and keep cp2&cp4? Because if you remove cp3 like in linear regression, it's as if the model still looks the same and cp3 is still there. So do you need to remove them either all of none? And what are the requirements for removing all of them then? How do you know if all of them are significant or not?",True

May I ask a (stupid) question...At 8:45, you mention that you predict heart disease for a female patient. However, how can I tell whether it means health or unhealthy? I remember you set the hd variable as 2 level: health and unhealthy. How do I know which level we are predicting?   In the github page, you tell us that:   ""## The intercept is the log(odds) a female will be unhealthy. This is because female is the first factor in ""sex"" (the factors are ordered, ## alphabetically by default,""female"", ""male"")"".... Does this alphabetical order also apply to ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy""? I am not sure why the intercept is not predicting ""healthy"" female patient because ""H"" (i.e., healthy) comes before ""U"" (i.e., unhealthy). This part really confuses me. Thank you!",True

Would it be better if we use the WOE or log(odd) of a variable rather than raw variable (for example gender -> dummy). If I'm not wrong to use a dummy variable in the model is not a good choice; 2. Correlation between variables;  3. Factor transformation ; 4. PCA analysis.  And as a result in order to calculate the probability from log(odds), we should use Sigmoid function?  I mean transform log(odds) to the probability  Thanks in advance!",True

@panagiotisgoulas8539,2019-01-10T08:31:03Z,1,"10:30 Hi again Josh. Regarding 10:30 have you by any chance got another video which regarding the effect size in logistic regression? I don't know much about it and actually things got more ugly when I tried interpret results. From what I learnt from previous videos: sexM (coefficient)=log(odds ratio male over female)  -Regarding sexM  (variable) a 1 unit increase in sexM (variable) (what does that even mean???) would state that the log odds of male would increase by 1.2737.  Obviously if I take the exp(sexM coefficient)=exp(1.2737)=3.57 I would get the odds ratio. Now someone on reddit posted that https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/3hbwen/calculating_odds_ratioeffect_size_for_a_logistic/ ""a 1 unit increase in the predictor variable x results in exp(coefx) greater chance that the independent variable y is 1 and then he talks a bit about effect size. According to this , that would mean that a 1 unit increase in sexM (variable) would result in 257% increase chance that the dependent variable heart disease will be 1  (meaning that there is 257% increase in the likelihood of heart disease). That doesn't make much sense. Especially since after reading all the posts of his it seems that the 257% is the effect size... What is happening?  Also 16:02 what is the $fitted.values?",True

@philippaknecht9247,2018-10-25T11:58:46Z,2,"Hi Josh I find your videos very informative and they help me a lot with my bachelors thesis. Because you put some variables into ""factors"" and others stay ""numeric"" I think I can ask my question, that I nowhere find an answer on the internet, or I don't know how! I do a logistic regression with NBA regular season games to find out if the fact that the teams are eliminated from the playoffs has an effect on their winning probability (to find out if they ""tank"" = intentionally loosing). For the variable of the current strength of the team I use the current winning percentage of the team (how many games won over how many games playd) and this variable is refreshed after every game. I was wondering if I can put this variable as a ""numeric""? Or as what kind of type would you define this winning percentage? The opponents winning percentage, whether the game is on the home court or not, if the team is statistically eliminated or in the playoffs and if the opponent is statistically eliminated or in the playoffs is also in the regression. It is the same regression some reserachers did back in 2002 to test the same thing but no one did recently. I hope you understand my question and hope very much, that you can and are willing to help me. Thank you very much and have a great day!",True
