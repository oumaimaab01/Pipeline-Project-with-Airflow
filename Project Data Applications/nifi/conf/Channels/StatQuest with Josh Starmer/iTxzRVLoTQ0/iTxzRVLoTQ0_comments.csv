@user-we1wz7wq3x,2023-12-31T00:06:09Z,0,"Very good content! I'm strugling to understand how can I do cross-validation before using over or undersampling; I'm using method cross_validate in sklearn.model_selection; it takes the dataset (with train+validation data), and for instance cv=5; it'll do the 5 splits, training the model on 4 of them and evaluating on the one that was left out of training. I don't see how can I implement over/undersampling, as it's a built-in method. Only option I see would be creating a ""CV splitter"", but it doesn't seem to me that that will work, as it seems to only change what goes into train and what goes into validation.",True

@yuwenchiou3911,2022-05-09T16:09:12Z,0,12:23 could anyone explain why the XGBoost is the best method in this example? I thought logistic regression is the better one... because of the presicion and accuracy both,True
@asmitashirude260,2021-11-12T05:47:41Z,1,Thanks for explaining the concepts in a simple way.  One request - can you please make a StatQuest video on ROSE and SMOTE? Thanks in advance!,True

@debadridutta,2021-08-31T18:32:55Z,0,"Hi Josh, I had a question. If I have text data is it correct to do SMOTE? If not how can we balance the classes in case of an NLP problem? I have seen very contradicting answers on this topic. Would love to get your view on this. Thanks!",True

@theconstantchange,2020-04-12T02:30:24Z,1,today i am truly happy to know that i am not the only one who has problem with 100s of different classification error metrics. JUST LOOK AT THE CONFUSION MATRIX. That's the best answer.  Your BRAIN is capable enough to understand the subtleties from the matrix. I had a very similar experience with SORTING algorithm. Some data scientist guy somewhere thinks he is too smart just coz he knows some sorting algorithm and rejected me. Maybe i am glad he did. I wouldn't want to work in a place where data scientists assessed based on sorting algorithms. Josh thanks a lot. You're my hero.,True
@SaurabhKumar-mr7lx,2020-04-05T03:56:05Z,0,"Hey Josh, hope you are good and healthy. I was going through few articles on local model explanation using LIME. It would be great help if you cover this topic along with practicle-real world examples and when to use such model. It would be of great help.",True

"" Which (statistical) techniques are out there to can create positive expectancy values ? ""  maybe a question for a next video or live session of course if you're willing to answer that  have a nice day PS anyway if you rather wish to answer other questions, I'm still wishing you of course the best and good luck with your other upcoming live sessions",True

@pdkovacs,2020-02-24T06:11:13Z,2,"Thanks a lot for this, Josh! Even though live-streams may not be as polished as edited videos (and I guess nobody gives a damn about this difference except you :-) ), the recapitulation parts are very useful for people like me, who need topics to be presented from slightly different perspectives so these topics are properly understood. Despite the easy looking presentation (which helps a lot in understanding the basic idea), these still seem pretty complex stuff to me, which require some more depths/view-points in presentation after introduced at a simplified level.",True

@kapkanal,2020-02-18T18:30:44Z,0,"Hi Josh, can you please make a video for Lod score Z = log of the odds (marker and condition co-segregate with a probability of theta of recombination) / (results are due to chance)? I believe this is used for GWAS studies but also at much smaller scale by clinical geneticists for mapping disease-related genes by analyzing family-pedigrees and thus finding potential linkages between markers/genes and an inherited disease. Being able to watch a BAM BAM BAM video of yours on this topic would help me so much. Thanks a lot!",True
@saileshpatra2488,2020-02-18T14:32:19Z,0,Why precision-recall curve is a better metric for class imbalance problem than roc-auc curve. Please explain. I have spent a lot in understanding this and u re my last hope,True

@mikhaeldito,2020-02-17T15:18:08Z,0,"Thanks for such a great video, as always!   By the way, do we need to have ANOVA P-value < 0.05 before doing pairwise t-tests? Most of the time, I am only interested in pairwise comparisons, not whether any of the diets made a difference.",True
@aditya4974,2020-02-17T15:17:35Z,1,Bam! We look forward to it. Thank you so much!,True
