@LayneSadler,2023-06-05T23:45:30Z,0,I'm trying to think of a reason why I shouldn't just compare the case-control distributions with:  KS test pval (y axis cutoff 0.05) over difference in normalized means (x axis cutoff +/- 50 TPM). We want to know if they come from the same distribution and don't want to tiny TPM changes.,True
@LayneSadler,2023-06-05T17:01:13Z,0,it's bananas that the top/bottom 30% of fold changes are discarded. is the reason because they prone to being +/- inf? tricky that values less than 1 lead to exploding ratios,True

@sunnetinternationalbusines9910,2022-07-09T11:38:41Z,0,Edge R seems to make more sense than DESEQ2 to me.,True

@kimseonhoon9704,2021-09-27T09:03:01Z,1,12:31 I like it,True
@binnylinny,2021-07-01T09:38:48Z,0,"edgeR just seems far more complicated than DESeq2. Is there any advantage edgeR has over DESeq2, apart from the artistic signature you mentioned towards the end? :P",True
@henricker,2021-05-03T15:03:31Z,0,"I really laughed my ass off at 12:30, thanks for the video.  To my understanding, isn't it weird that it's possible to have a reference sample for a gene where there are 0 reads on that gene? Wouldn't it be possible to take a reference sample for each gene to avoid this issue? I don't see how this makes sense logically, but I might have missed something. Thank you!",True
@ElNick09,2021-01-14T22:42:17Z,2,"This is an explanation of the process executed in TMM normalization, as made clear at 10:37. I'm just saying this in case anyone has come to this video, as i have, looking for an explanation of TMM normalization.",True
@jesusmateoamillanocisneros6192,2020-10-24T18:01:43Z,0,Hello! Is possible make a association between environment variable and bacteria abundance? Sorry for my english!,True
@ns43253,2020-08-06T00:05:29Z,0,Do you have suggestions on whether someone should use edgeR or DeSEQ2 for 16S analysis of soil communities?,True
@victorhigareda4716,2020-07-10T16:27:18Z,1,"The reference sample could be one of the treatments or one of the controls in one RNA-seq experiment , is it correct?. Thank you for your great explanation",True
@Adelphos0101,2020-05-06T20:00:29Z,0,Is there any reason for edgeR to use the 75th quantile instead of the median to pick the reference sample? Very nice video to understand edgeR.,True
@Reza_Ghamsari,2020-04-26T06:53:08Z,1,"This is great, thank you. I don't understand how did you calculate the weighted average? Is that just the average of log-ratios? ""12:28""",True
@blankaroje8853,2020-04-20T12:51:45Z,2,Thank you!,True
@tkdlvk27,2019-09-05T15:33:36Z,2,"wow.. this is amazing method, and your explanation",True
@liangcheng7824,2019-05-21T22:30:11Z,0,"This is really great! I'm a little bit confused, don't people use some conserved genes that have a relative steady expression level as references to normalize their data?",True
