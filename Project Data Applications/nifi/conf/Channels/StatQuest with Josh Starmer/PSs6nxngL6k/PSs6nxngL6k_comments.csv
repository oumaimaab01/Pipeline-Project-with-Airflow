@sreerajnr689,2024-05-05T12:44:12Z,0,"Your explanation is AMAZING AS ALWAYS!! I have 1 doubt. Do we do the attention calculation only on the final layer?

The first two numbers we get are from the [scaled(input1-cell1) + scaled(input2-cell1) ] and [scaled(input1-cell2) + scaled(input2-cell2) ] right?

@sunnywell264,2023-09-30T07:19:17Z,1,"Hi @statquest / @Josh ... This is an amazing video and i had been going through your content. All of those content are some of the best explanations of AI that I have seen till date. In this video towards the end where we are setting the input values of the fully connected layer, i am not able to place the values besides the value of one of the attention value. Please confirm below if I am right:  Value from Encoder Layer: let's : -0.76(1st LSTM) | 0.75(2nd LSTM) go: 0.01(1st LSTM) | -0.01(2nd LSTM)  Value from Decoder Layer: EOS: 0.91(1st LSTM) | 0.38(2nd LSTM)  Similarity Scores: Lets and EOS : (0.91 X -0.76) + (0.38 X 0.75) = -0.6916 + 0.285 = -0.4066 ~ -0.41 go and EOS: (0.91 X 0.01) + (0.38 X -0.01) = 0.0091 + -0.0038 = 0.0053 ~ -0.01   After Softmax Lets and EOS: 0.4 go and EOS: 0.6  Attention Value for 1st LSTM which is rolled twice(for lets and go): -0.76*0.4 + 0.01*06 = -0.298 ~ -0.3 0.75*0.4 + -0.01*0.6 = 0.3 - 0.06 = 0.24  Thus we get the following input values for the fully connected layer: 1. Value from 1st LSTM Layer(Decoder) -> EOS: 0.91 2. Attention Value for 1st LSTM Layer(Encode) wrt EOS -> -0.3 I suppose the following two values are what we get from 2nd LSTM layer which has a different initial values for initial Short term memory and Long Term memory: 3. Value from 2nd LSTM Layer(Decoder) -> EOS: 0.4  Let me know if my understanding is correct Josh.",True

@sciboy123,2023-07-26T20:15:18Z,0,I had a little confusion about the final fully connected layer. It takes in separate attention values for each input word.

In the future one can find a model with self-encoder-soft-attention-direct-decoder you name it, but it's still garbage in garbage out. Do you think there is a way to plug a fairness/bias filter to the layers so instead of trying to filter the output of the model you just don't produce unfair output?
