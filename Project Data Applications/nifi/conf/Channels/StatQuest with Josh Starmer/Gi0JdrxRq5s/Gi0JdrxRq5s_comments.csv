@statquest,2020-12-21T17:53:01Z,7,"NOTE: This video describes edgeR's method for filtering counts prior to version 3.28.1. The newer versions do things differently. However, since there are tons of publications and datasets based on the earlier versions, I still think this video is helpful to understand what is going on.

@user-rf9ow8ck2l,2024-03-26T19:18:04Z,0,"I love this video, incredibly helpful. My only criticism is, what is meant by ""bogus tests""? Are these tests with samples drawn from the same distribution?",True
@rheasingh6825,2023-12-05T17:07:07Z,1,"hi josh! still wondering if you may ever follow up on the next parts of how do you calculate the average log2(FoldChange), and how the negative binomial model is used? there seems to be no great info available online on how these next steps are done, and any follow ups on these tutorials would be so helpful! or if you dont have the time for that, any links to resources that may be helpful in understanding the next steps?",True
@fahdqadir6212,2023-06-24T22:30:34Z,0,"staaaaaaatqueeeeaaaaaaaast...... Gotta be honest at this point I just come back to these videos for the first 1min. Also I came here to say, I always pronounced it HOCHH-berg, wheras you pronounce it HOOOCH-berg, is that correct or an inside joke? Just curious, great job otherwise your videos got me through grad school.",True

@manuelsokolov,2023-04-15T10:42:16Z,0,Can DESeq be used when the data is in the TPM format?,True
@motasimmasood3248,2022-11-23T20:16:00Z,1,"Amazing!!! one question, what happens next? You have normalized read counts, you got rid of the outliers now how do you calculate the average log2(FoldChange) and lfcSE, i.e., the ERROR.",True
@Ankhelz,2022-03-25T17:59:15Z,0,"I have a brief and quite obvious question. This ""p-value"" adjustment (FDR) is done after a simple t-test is performed between both treatment for each gene (along the whole dataframe)?  Thanks! Great video, I love your content. (wish i could buy a shirt, but no shipping to Argentina) :)",True
@emojiman745,2022-03-16T17:57:12Z,4,Does part 3 exist? or part 4?,True
@blackV199,2021-11-13T10:32:41Z,0,Can anyone answer me this: What happens if I don't use Independent Filtering ? how does this affect my results ?,True
@tinacole1450,2021-10-31T16:24:51Z,0,"Do you know anything about awk commands? I am trying to get the frequency of all lines of DNA input from a txt file? For example, if pattern GCGCTTAATA is within a list 10 times, I need for the read out to list the 10 as a frequency. I am using AWK",True
@iot3136,2020-12-22T07:15:14Z,1,"Hi Josh, Could you please create a youtube lesson/guideline on R for Bioconductor summarized experiments. Especially explaininng  S4 SE data analysis. Would be really appreciated.",True
@MyUsernameForReal,2020-11-08T23:01:05Z,4,"Wow, what a great and clear explanation! If anyone's interested to know, the link to the code in the description is outdated; the code can be found at this link: https://statquest.org/statquest-filtering-genes-with-low-read-counts/  Thanks!",True
@taotaotan5671,2020-05-22T23:14:16Z,6,"Hi, Josh. I was wondering if this filtering method is a little p-hacking...  Say, in my initial analysis, I randomly choose a cutoff (quantile/ CPM) but didn't find the gene of my interest. Then I change the cutoff, and this results in more hits, which include the gene of my interest. Then I report that gene, which wasn't significant at the very beginning.",True
@lihuajiang1771,2020-04-18T18:30:05Z,1,"For the R code, could you let us know where we can download the dataset? Thank you.",True
@sebastiangerety8726,2020-03-27T16:58:06Z,0,"Could you explain this statement? 19:55 ""If none of the raw values goes above the threshold, then no filtering is done.""  I thought it would be the opposite, if none of the CPMs for any of the genes is BELOW the threshold, then no genes are filtered out.  Thanks!",True
@thomasmatthew7759,2019-05-27T20:24:35Z,15,"Do you have any more videos about DESeq2?  I'm trying to understand the role of the negative binomial distribution to their tests (independent Bernoulli Trials), but I'm having trouble understanding what each test is supposed to represent.  Is each test just the difference in gene expressions between conditions?",True

@charade76,2018-05-07T19:38:59Z,1,2:47 - Why do you choose two different yet overlapping distributions in this simulation? What would be the effect if you just pick two distributions that do not overlap?,True
@reytns1,2017-09-26T09:39:31Z,0,"Hi Joshua, great explanation to take into account differences for EdgeR and DESeq2. I am Biologist with a medium statistical background and I am new in RNA-Seq Analysis. Uptoday I am working in plants (Table Grape-diploid). Could you tell What your RNASeq pipeline is? Did you work all analysis in R or maybe you do some trimming thing in other software related to Linux? Under your criteria how is the best way to start a RNA-Seq analysis?     Thanks and I really appreciate that you share your knowedlge",True
@kakusniper,2017-09-12T15:02:41Z,0,"Is there any difference between the order of normalization and then filtering, as shown in your code ? In some examples, I have seen filtering with at least one count per million (cpm) (in at least n samples) done before normalization.  Also, why filtering was done in different way (second largest cpm value for each gene), as shown in the code vs  rowSums(cpm(dataset)>1) >= n (Usually this step was done before normalization)?",True
