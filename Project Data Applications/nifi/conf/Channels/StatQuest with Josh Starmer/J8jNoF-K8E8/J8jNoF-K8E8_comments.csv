Probability of get 4 orange fanta out of 7 indipendent interviews:  pof<-dbinom(4,7,0.5) = 0.2734375. Given the definition of p-value I could have summed al the events equally rare ora rarer and get 1, as you have done manually in the video. Being the null hypotesis that pepole does non have preference over orange fanta wrt grape fanta, I do not reject the NH.  Moreover I tried some godness of fit tests (without knowing excacly the theory and the math) : chi square and fischer exact test: data. I found natural to set the test like this: chisq.test(x=c(4,3), p=c(0.5, 0.5)),  but I think there are at least two errors: 1) expected value in come cells are less than 5 and 2) anyway I don't get P-value=1 Output: Chi-squared test for given probabilities  data:  c(4, 3) X-squared = 0.14286, df = 1, p-value = 0.7055  Warning message: In chisq.test(x = c(4, 3), p = c(0.5, 0.5)) :   L'approssimazione al Chi-quadrato potrebbe essere inesatta  On the otherer hand I tried fisher.test data = matrix(data=c(4,3,0.5, 0.5), nrow=2) data      [,1] [,2] [1,]    4  0.5 [2,]    3  0.5 > fisher.test(data)  	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data   p-value = 1 alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval:    0 Inf sample estimates: odds ratio           0   Warning message: In fisher.test(data) :   'x' has been rounded to integer: Mean relative difference: 1  In the end the binom.test: binom.test(4,7,0.5, alternative = ""two.sided"")  	Exact binomial test  data:  4 and 7 number of successes = 4, number of trials = 7, p-value = 1 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 95 percent confidence interval:  0.1840516 0.9010117 sample estimates: probability of success               0.5714286  The bottom line: while the video is very clear and give us a step by step explanation of the topics, we can't always relay on manual calculation of the p-value or to test hypotesis. An appropriate test in needed for testing the goodness of fit, but I understand that it's not so easy and it's probably beyond the scope of this beatuful course. I tried using some ""godness of test ""tests in R but the results are non convincing; the simple chi square test it's probablly inappropriate due to very low cells count, on the other hand I lack the theory to say if fisher test and exact binomial test are appropriate and well conducted.

What you learned in p value videos about the two sided p-value and the video on 'what are stats model' was used here . Here our model(which was also our null hypothesis) is that both flavours are EQUALLY loved , so both have a probability of 0.5(this is NOT p-value, this is just our model-Remember that a model can be an 'equation' or a 'relationship' between variables) And since are p-value came out to be larger than 0.05 we rejected the alternate hypothesis that one of them is more loved.
