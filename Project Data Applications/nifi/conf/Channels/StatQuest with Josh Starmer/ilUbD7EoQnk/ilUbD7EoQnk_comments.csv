@pmicozzi,2023-01-07T04:03:20Z,0,"Josh, I’ve watched your vids and they amongst the best on the subject…Big appreciation for your work and knowledge.   This video how ever gives too much credit to the organizations using ML.  A far greater motive for the organization using ML is pointed toward the exploitation of people to further the corporate endeavor, which is not in alignment with man as a whole.  It’s greed for knowledge and competitive advantage over the good for all!!  QUadruple BAM!!",True

@SPLICY,2021-05-27T13:34:35Z,84,"This video is ON POINT!  It's surprising how many data scientists I've met that are not curious about the data.  More than the investigations Josh suggests, I highly recommend looking at data on the most granular level.  Seeing data at its most fundamental level can give you insights or ideas that may not be apparent when doing global analysis.  Additionally, visualize the data when you can!  It's difficult to understate how much visualizations have helped me over the years.  Finally, akin to the demographics Josh was talking about in his first example, try slicing the data in different ways.  Does it change by day? What do the outliers look like? etc.  Remember:  BE CURIOUS",True
