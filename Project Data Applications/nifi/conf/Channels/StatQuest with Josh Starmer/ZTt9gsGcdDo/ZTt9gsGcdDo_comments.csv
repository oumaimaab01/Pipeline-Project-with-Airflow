@werewolfprogrammer,2023-12-21T19:40:44Z,0,"Hi, I am trying to start a youtube channel to make tutorial videos about data science related topics. I want to make the videos about things that are less popular but still important, since I found that it can be quite difficult to start off with these things since most information is in difficult to comprehend papers. My starting point will be social network analysis and natural language processing as that is my main interest and expertise. However, I am interested in finding more topics so I am starting by doing research on different channels that make tutorials for data science, AI, machine learning, statistics, natural language processing, graph theory or network analysis.   So for anybody in the comments that reads this message, could you help me out by replying with any youtube creators that do something related to these topics, or any other digital platform like Brilliant. If you know a topic that is similar to the ones I mentioned that would also be a great thing to share. Or if you know of better places to share this message. Or any other helpfull tips.  Thanks everybody for the help. If this message is regarded as spam also please say so and I will remove it.

@davidmurphy563,2023-12-11T08:10:37Z,3,"Ok, it always annoyed me that when you're doing matrix vector (col) multiplication they always write the matrix first, then the vector. It never occured to me until you said so just now that the cols and rows aren't valid tensor operations if you write them the other way round... Doh! It doesn't look nice though.  Btw, why did you use a row vector and a transverse matrix? I would always use a col vector. Col space transforms are the default for me and you can picture the latent space.  The only times I'd use rows is if I have a system of linear equations.",True
