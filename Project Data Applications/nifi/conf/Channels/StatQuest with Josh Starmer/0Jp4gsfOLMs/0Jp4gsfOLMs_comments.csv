@asfarlathif9943,2019-12-12T17:11:53Z,1,Hello Josh! I just wanted to say a huge thanks for making these explanation videos on stats concepts. It's been a huge help for me to get my head around these complicated topics on my own. I was also looking for videos explaining the mathematics behind the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION method and how to implement it in R. I would greatly appreciate it if you make a video explaining SVD (and its practical implementation in R). Thanks again!,True

@qhphan5,2019-08-12T04:21:11Z,2,"Hi Josh! Thanks for your great video! Just want to ask what exactly are principal components? Is there a principal component for each sample, or each measurement? Because in this video at 3:35, you said ""Since there are 10 samples, there are 10 PCs"". But in the other video about PCA (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ&t=992s), it seems to me that for each measurement (or each gene), there is a PC.",True

@wenhucao5307,2018-11-21T06:23:58Z,1,"Correct me pls. I think there should be 100 PCs (for each gene) to discriminate the 10 samples, while you said only 10 PCs, if this is due to transposition needed by prcomp(), then should there be 100 dots in the graph? Now it looks like 10PCs for 10 samples, where does the 100 genes go?",True
@elovyn7210,2018-11-11T14:38:50Z,3,"Well explained, thanks!  I used PCA, trying out different packages, would be nice to have some information on those mentioned as well, some of them provide nice functions for visualisation. When I do/try PCA, I find it most challenging to prepare the dataset to be suitable for PCA, but I guess that is a different topic of how to standardize variables and what to do with categorical variables etc.",True

@user-ib9lp8zx6x,2018-06-05T12:34:14Z,1,"Hi, Joshua, to clarify, in prcomp, the scale = T means, each value in the original dataset (not the transposed one) would minus the rowMean and then divided by standard deviation of the row?",True

@burcakotlu7858,2018-02-20T01:05:40Z,1,"Thank you for these videos. Having said that I want to ask you a question @5:58 you have drawn the ""My PCA Graph"", samples with positive X are on the right of graph and samples with negative X are on the left of the graph. However although sample ""ko2"" has the highest Y  value,  it is not on the top right of the graph. What is the reason for that? I guess since there are other PCs that also effect and this graph shows the overall  resulting graph but with only two PCs are shown. Is that the reason for that? And also what must we do if our samples are not separated this much clearly? Thanks.",True

@adelutzaification,2017-12-06T14:58:46Z,0,"The more I read,  the less I understand... Bam! I like to tinker with things and change a parameter here in there in R to see how the outcome changes. So, I performed PCA using your script and by not transposing the data... To my surprise, I did't get 100 PCs as the number of rows(genes), but 10, like the number of columns (the real variables). Double Bam! The proportion of variance of the PCs differed between the PCA called on the transposed dataset and the original one.  I also tried the princomp function which only accepts the dataset as is, as it doesn't like more variables then measurements/units. To me, that implies that the default for this function is PCA by column. And the results (proportion of variance) are identical with the case in which prcomp is applied to the dataset in the original format. Triple bam!   Please, enlighten me. Mehr licht!",True
@adelutzaification,2017-11-30T23:50:28Z,0,"In your comments and elsewhere, I encountered the notions of ""covariance"" and ""correlation"" (matrix) in the context of PCA.  I assume that it is the correlation between the different variables (cells in your example). This is my current gestalt. To me, at an intuitive level, correlation implies redundancy (as one variable can be predicted from the other), and therefore, allows the opportunity for simplification/dimension reduction performed by PCA.  Reciprocally, correlation between the initial variables / cells also implies an intrinsic similarity/""core pattern"" that is further revealed by PCA (in the form of ""density clouds"" when 2 principal components are plotted). How far out am I? 😉 On a more practical side, I read about the so-called adequacy tests such as KMO, Bartlett’s sphericity tests (that test for some measure of correlation it seems) to determine whether PCA is pertinent as an analysis for a particular dataset. Do you apply these tests in your work or you know a priori that the type of experiment lends itself to PCA analysis? You also mention about the QC of PCA in the scree plot example and you indicate the importance of the first 2 PCs. I assume that the amount of variation a PC accounts for, relates somehow to the scale/range of that PC as the wider the range, the better clusters separate. The choice of the first 2 PCs seems like a good application for gene expression as it can separate clusters more readily. I also encountered analyses which use criteria such as Kaiser’s criterion (stdev of a pc >1) to select PCs for further analysis such factor analysis or clustering to further reveal more hidden pattern. Do you know of any such examples applied in biology/gene expression?  Thank you for your patience 😊",True
@adelutzaification,2017-11-29T03:02:18Z,1,"Hey Josh, Thanks again for putting all this work in making these videos. As a new student of R, I appreciate every time I learn a new trick from reading a script and I am glad when I can decipher and understand the scripts I read.  You really distilled a lot of valuable ""R knowledge"" in this video... That being said, I was wondering if you are open to receive and maybe post comments / potential useful tricks for data analyzing in R/ applied to a certain topic. Like a mini-forum. I am thinking that by doing so, it would stimulate more discussion and that more people would benefit. I figure that your audience might grow as well ;) As a potential topic for discussion,  what do you think about talking about contrasting various types of distributions, the types of data they apply to, and the proper statistical tests that are applicable for such data sets ?",True
