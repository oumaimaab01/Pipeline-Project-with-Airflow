@statquest,2022-09-13T00:35:10Z,15,NOTE: Lightning 2.0 changed the way the learning rate tuner is accessed. This has been updated in the jupyter notebook that you can download here: https://lightning.ai/lightning-ai/studios/statquest-introduction-to-neural-networks-with-pytorch-lightning To learn more about Lightning: https://lightning.ai/ Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/,True

@dimabear,2023-08-15T20:04:58Z,0,"When you calculate the optimal learning rate, what is it that you're actually maximizing/minimizing?  I get when you're minimizing loss, you're finding the optimal weights/biases that minimize the loss. But when you try to find the optimal learning rate, what are you maximizing/minimizing and what are you calculating with respect to? For example, the first parameter to lr_find is model, which is BasicLightningTrain(). And BasicLightningTrain() has fixed parameters, as well as the final bias which was changed from -16 to 0. So does this mean that lr_find() used the fixed parameters? If so, I'm assuming if we had set final bias to a random value (instead of 0) we'd arrive at a different optimal learning rate? thanks!",True

Got an idea and would love your insights. Here's the brief:  I want to to train the NN based on the fully annotated scRNA-seq dataset (A) with multi-dimensional inputs (genes) and 15 outputs - 15 different cell types/annotations/labels. Then I want to take a new scRNA-seq dataset (B) and use the trained model to annotate it (transfer the labels). Now I want to ""improve"" this model by adding an additional feature from the dataset B. This feature contains information about the origin of each input- origin X or non-X.  I would end up with 30 outputs - 15 different cell types x 2 (origin X or non-X). From here, I would like to take this new ""improved"" model and use it to annotate scRNA-seq dataset (C).  Do you think this is feasible, and do you have any advice on how to ""improve"" the model? Thanks again for the amazing content!",True
@katetanjin,2023-06-24T04:09:09Z,0,"Hi, Josh, thanks a lot for the super informative video! I tried that with 34 epochs, learning_rate=0.002 will result in final_bias=-2, which is still far from correct, with learning_rate=0.1, 34 epochs gives final_bias 16, that means 0.1 is a better learning rate value than 0.002, but why tuner gives 0.002?
