@statquest,2020-01-14T11:45:39Z,55,"Corrections: 16:50 I say ""66"", but I meant to say ""62.48"". However, either way, the conclusion is the same. 22:03 In the original XGBoost documents they use the epsilon symbol to refer to the learning rate, but in the actual implementation, this is controlled via the ""eta"" parameter. So, I guess to be consistent with the original documentation, I made the same mistake! :)  Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/",True

One question: I am looking at the recurrence of a disease following surgery and I evaluate time for recurrence and probability with CPH. But in non-life science, eg. customer churn, default of payment etc there is no censored cases and not considered in the ML models, such as XGBoost. Is it correct for me to use ML in the similar way for cutomer churn and customer default, despite the censored data? Please advice. Many thanks. I  (not only me every budding data scienist) would very much appreciate if you could create a tutorial video (and upload) generating Nomogram for Time event?

I was wondering how this can be made sense of intuitively, for example if we consider two nodes such that:   -- Node 1 residuals : (-0.00001, +0.00001) they would cancel out and a low similarity score would imply that they're very different. -- Node 2 residuals: (-1, +100) we get a large similarity score which would imply that they're similar.

While trying to determine which value to split on we split, calculate similarity scores of the left and right leaves and subtract the similarity score for the root. But why do we need to make this subtraction? Won't the similarity score of the root be the same for all splits. Simply put since we are trying to find which split gives the highest split won't Similarity score of left Leaf + Similarity score of right leaf be enough to determine the value to split on. Why do we need an extra subtraction (of the root's similarity score)?",True
@des_224,2021-10-15T16:13:07Z,0,"Hey Josh, I remember in your regression tree vid you mentioned that after we split the root node, the subsequent splits of the child nodes only happen if its size is greater than a typical threshold (~20) to prevent overfitting, e.g. if a node has size < 20, then we take the average value and make it a leaf. Does XGBoost do the same for an actual dataset, and does it also do the random forest thing where it randomly selects m from p features (where m~root(p)) when generating the individual splits for each tree? thanks!",True

Each value give a set of Similarity and Gain scores ..Similarity (use lambda here, the regularisation parameter) - measure how close the residual values to each other ..Gain (affected by lamda) .Pick the feature value that give highest gain - this determines how to split the data - which create the branch (and leaves) - which produce a mini tree. 4) Prune tree.  Using gain threshold (aka complexity parameter), gamma. If gain>gamma, keep branch, else prune 5) Get Output Value OV for each leaf.  Mini tree done.    OV = sum of Residuals / (no. of Residuals + lambda) 6) Predict value for each sample using the newly created mini tree.   Run each sample data through the mini tree.

Can't we intialize initial value in a same way as we did in Gradient boosting (mean of Dependent variable)?     3) How have you decided threshold for dosage like Dosage<30, Dosage>15, and Dosage>22.5? Is there any steps or rule for that?  4) What learning parameter do and it should have small or high value? What is lamda here? Can we take any value of lambda?

I like to ""brag"" that I can overfit anything.  That, of course, is a problem, but I've found a tweak that is simple and fast that I haven't seen elsewhere.  The basic idea is that when selecting a split point, pick a small number of data vectors randomly from the training set.  Pick the variable(s) to split on randomly.  (Variables plural because I usually split on 2-4 variables into 2^^n boosting regions - another useful tweak.)  The thresholds are whatever the data values are for the selected vectors.  Find the vector with the best ""gain"" and split with that.  I typically use 5 - 100 tries per split and a learning rate of .5 or so.  It's fast and mitigates the overfitting problem.

Q2-Like Gradient Boost, after the first iteration, do we calculate the new residual value for a sample as  (actual predicted value - (initial prediction + predicted value from first XGBoost tree)) , so that this value can be used as the target for prediction when the second XGBoost Tree is built ?",True

@junaidbutt3000,2019-12-19T23:16:09Z,7,This has been one video I’ve been waiting for and it was well worth it. Brilliant as usual Josh.   I wanted to ask about the differences between the XGBoost regression tree and the traditional regression tree with Boosting. It seems that the main difference is that the XGBoost version uses the gain measure (made of similarity) to determine the split thresholds for each feature (I presume if we had more than dosage we would consider them in the same way) and prunes according to the gamma parameter. Whereas the traditional tree uses a measure like Gini impurity to split and a method like cost complexity pruning. Is that the main difference? Or are there any more?   Could you also mention why this type of tree is better than the traditional version? It seems like the algorithm has some optimisation for this type of tree than the other.,True

@zachariahmarrero9358,2019-12-16T18:48:13Z,0,"You can change Xgboost’s default score.  Set ‘base_score’ equal to the mean of your target variable (if using regression) or to the ratio of the majority class over sample size (if using classification).  This will reduce the number of trees needed for fitting the algorithm and it will save a lot of time.  If you don’t set the base score then the algorithm will, effectively, start by solving the problem of the mean.  The reason why is because the mean has the unique property of being a ‘pretty good guess’ in the absence of any other meaningful information in the dataset. As another intuition, you’ll find too, that if you apply regularization too strongly that Xgboost will “predict” that essentially every case is either the mean or very close to it.",True
