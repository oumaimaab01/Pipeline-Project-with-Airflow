If all the TPR values are lined up on y-axis( meaning FPR was always 0 for all thresholds), The curve would just be a straight line and hence, AUC would be 0 (which is bad).

I think it might be helpful to show a little demonstration of it.  and if anybody reads this comment and struggles with the AUC - you can calculate it by dividing the ROC into segments - trapezoids - and calc it using the formula (1/2*(hight1+hight2)*width). in the video for example - (0.25,0.75), (0.5,1), so 1/2*(0.75+1)*0.25. and once again Josh - great videos! much appreciated!!",True

@AggressivesnowmaN,2020-12-07T08:09:14Z,0,I often see ROC and AUC used to classify differentially expressed genes across clusters in single cell RNA seq data. But I am trying to conceptualize how it is applied to these genes without a sense of specificity or sensitivity as there is no sense of true positive or negative in the data.   In the data there is simply a set of genes belonging to a cluster with a score for each describing expression relative to other clusters. Also the percentage of cells expressing the gene in the cluster and out of the cluster is recorded.   I should probably read up on this elsewhere but if anyone has a quick explanation let me know.,True

I almost understood everything, besides one detail that bugs me: when we visually decide/pick the best point of ROC and say, this is the threshold to go for.. how do we know which threshold that is? Seems to me that threshold value never gets ""recorded"" on ROC graph, which in my opinion feels like missing..  Also, when you say we don't need to deal with all of the confusion matrices; we still need to do it somehow, since they are the base for calculations and hence for drawing ROC, don't we?",True

@tiagoshimizu6473,2020-10-27T15:03:11Z,0,"I‚Äôm trying to connect dots and concepts and have some questions, specifically on Random Forest and AUC:  1. Would it be conceptually correct to optimize Random Forest parameters, such as number of estimators and/or number of variables sent to create trees (standard square root of total number of variables), by finding the highest AUC for each parameter?   2. If the answer is yes to the first question: In what order should I do? Because if I optimize first, for instance, number of estimators, I‚Äôll find a different number for the number of variables and vice versa.  - also I‚Äôve plot AUC x n_estimators and there is a lot of noise rather than a smooth curve, which makes me think it is not very accurate this optimization - if I restart the kernel and run again the values change a lot too. Why does it happen if I use the same train and test sets?  3. Is there any ‚Äúglobal best optimization‚Äù? If so, how can I find it? Why would it be different if I optimize number of estimators and number of variables with AUC versus OOB error?   Thanks a lot for your amazing videos!",True

I was a little preoccupied since the context of the case was requiring a much better recall. So I decided to try to get a better recall and a descent AUC score. In the end using a different model and with hyper parameter tuning I was able to get a descent recall (0.8) and a descent AUC score (0.83) . My questions: Did I take the  correct approach?

@user-bc9lq3mv5e,2019-11-19T06:04:56Z,0,"Oops, I have another question... If I replace 'false negative rate' with 'precision', sometimes there is possibility that there is no (1, 1) point on the ROC graph. When there are data points that their values on x-axis are totally same, but some have a value of 1 on y-axis and others have a value of 0 on y-axis, (maybe this situation will be plotting on the graph like , , , : : ` ` ` <- I'm not sure you can understand this shape... sorry I can't append the image...), then the maximum value of precision is less than 1. What I want to know is, in this situation, how AUC will be defined?",True

I think they have the same definition, true positives/(true positives+false positives) = true positive rate. If it is correct, replacing the false positive rate with precision is weird. Because then x-axis and y-axis are same. Please correct me... :(",True
