You make me think that statistics can be very daunting most of the time for the lack of experts like you that can really explain its details in a very simple way. For me, this is true sign of mastery! I had one question regarding this video though, based on your other video where you explain the difference between probability (P(data | mean, sd) )and likelihood (L (mean, sd| data)). Where the in the former you find the distribution of the data under a fixed hypothesis and the latter you find the best distribution that fit the data.   Somehow in this video about logistic regression i feel that you talk about the likelihood in terms of the probability. As in ""the likelihood of that this mouse is obese [given the shape of the squiggle] is the same as the predicted probability."" So here the likelihood of the data point (the mouse) is based on a fixed distribution? Could you explain that if you have time? :) Again, really appreciate all that you do!!!",True

Is there a method to iterating through the possible 'best' fitted line candidates? You mention some algorithms for choosing.

I am a political science student and am currently working on an article exploring the relationship between revolutionary regime change and various socio-economic factors. Accordingly, the dependent variable in my equation is 1 if the revolution happened, and 0 if not. The problem is that in the first case, I use the values ​​of independent variables (GDP, education level, etc.) that existed just before the revolution. And in the second case, the political regime could have existed for decades, and throughout this time the values ​​of the independent variables changed.
