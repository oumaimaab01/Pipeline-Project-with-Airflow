Is it because we are doing a drug-specific mean calculation, as opposed to calculating a single mean in null hypothesis?  Or is it for some other reason?",True

@ggoogi3046,2020-12-19T14:26:29Z,1,"Hi, I'm obscure what means failing to reject null hypothesis is the same thing that using two averages means ""overfitting"" in ML. Is that means we don't need to using two averages when estimate the whole of the average? As I know, the ""overfitting"" means that the model doesn't represent the population(not whole but only training set). Could you explain more clearly?",True

@wtrx,2020-08-29T06:57:57Z,1,If there are only 2 groups of data (A & B) and we reject the null hypothesis does that mean we accept the alternative hypothesis?,True
@bhang96,2020-08-25T09:08:20Z,0,"BAM - There are too many possibilities to test to know if we have accepted the correct one. And this is why we only **reject** or **fail to reject** the **null** or **primary hypothesis**.  Double BAM - When we only have two groups of data, the **Alternative Hypothesis** is super obvious because it is just the opposite of the **Null Hypothesis**. But when we have 3 or more groups we have options for the Alternative Hypothesis, and depending on which one we use on the statistical test, we can end up making a different decision about the **Null Hypothesis**",True
