From the video you mentioned in @7:42, can we say that the probability of a random dot on a random line is equal to the proportion of a line to the 2-D plain, which is the area of a line/area of a plain = 0/1? As we are interested in the probability of a random dot on a random line, it's actually the same as asking the chance of the dot on the line/the chance of the dot on the whole plain.

In the later, a gradual increase in correlation towards 1 is shown together with a gradual movement of the slope towards 1. Better way would be to fix the slope, and have the correlation vary, by ""diffusing"" the plotted measurements. That would complement the earlier part of the video I think, and make the point that the two properties (slope, correlation) vary independently of one another.  p.s. unsure if the above is due to the possibility of not being able to have a weak correlation with a slope of 1, as it seems you can't have ""no correlation"" without a slope of 0 or undefined.",True

As per my understanding from your p-value video, p-value is the sum of probability of  1. choosen rare event to occur 2. similar rare event to occur  3. Any other rare event to occur  If this is the case, p-value for correleated value shouldn't be high, because p-value will inform what is the probability of having this event to occur i.e event of higher correlation.

@andreibarbulescu7812,2020-07-04T16:46:28Z,0,"Very well explained! However, there is one thing that may be a bit confusing.  In your explanation of how correlation indicates the fit of the model, the better fit models (stronger correlation) also have a steeper slopes. I guess this is not necessarily the case. A linear model may have a steep slope (mean Y changes a lot with a 1 unit change in X) but the correlation between X and Y could still be weak if there is a lot of variability in Y around each of the [mean Y] predicted by the model, for fixed values of X. Basically a model with a large coefficient of X that has a bad fit to the data. In the case of the multivariate model, If X had a large coefficient (slope) relative to the other variables in the model, I guess this would indicate that X explains more of the variation in Y than the other variables in the model (i.e. Y will change most when changing X, according to the model), but still there could be a lot of variation in Y that is not explained by the model at all (not so good fit). Thus, the slope indicates the relative contribution of X to explaining variability in Y, but only variability that is explained by the model. The correlation coefficient (squared) indicates the proportion of total variability in Y that is explained by the model (containing only X in this case).",True

I think this may be misleading because it suggests that b smaller p values mean more accurate guesses.  I would rather say that smaller  p value means more confidence that we are accurately seeing the QUALITY of the guesses we can make (not the guess itself, which is indicated by the correlation value).

So even though a variable covaries with another, it does not necessarily mean there is a correlation between the two. I can't see this part being explained in this video, and to me, from the video, it seems like correlation is just easier to interpret a relationship than covariance, it does not make it an establishment of a cause and effect relationship.

For example, gene abundance of different bacteria in different soil samples derived from different regions. PCA can analyze the cluster of data, RDA could analyze how the environment factors influenced the abundance of bacterial cimmunity. but someone said mulltivariate linear regression could incorporate PCA and replace RDA?",True

@wlcha3932,2019-08-07T00:17:14Z,0,Thanks for your video that make me understand more about correlation but at 17:00 what does it mean by it's not obvious that the relationship with correlation = 0.9 is twice as good at making prediction as the relationship with correlation = 0.64? are there any relation between 0.9 and 0.64 which makes this claim? Thanks for your help,True

@msunardi,2019-08-06T05:58:19Z,0,"I think this sentence is difficult to grasp for me... the p-value = 0.03 means ""there is 3% chance that random data could produce a similarly strong relationship, or stronger"" Could you rephrase it? Can I say that: if our data was produced by truly random chance/process (i.e. ""random data""), there is only 3% chance (i.e. very rare) that it would exhibit the relationship (i.e. correlation) that we're seeing in the data we currently have?",True
