@buihung3704,2023-11-08T17:49:34Z,0,"Hmm the way you calculate Likelihood in this video is different from the Likelihood vs Probability video. - In Likelihood vs Probability video, you calculate the Likelihood of a distribution we are assumed to have 2 characteristics (mean + S.D), GIVEN that you measure some data from that distribution. The Likelihood is used to determined the assumption is correct or not (if correct, it's the Maximum Likelihood). So Likelihood is used to find the distribution, given the measures data. - In this video, you calculate the Likelihood of a continuous variable (Popcorn, Soda pop, Candy) occurs, GIVEN that the person is either Like Troll 2 or Don't Like Troll 2. In my opinion, the term Likelihood here is very similar to the term Probability that you use in Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier video, hence isn't same as Likelihood vs Probability video. Note that the distribution is fixed here.  Q1: So I guess your Likelihood = Probability in this case? Q2: May I ask if Likelihood applies to continuous variables like Popcorn, Soda pop and Candy... and Probability (interchangbly with Likelihood also) applies to discrete variables like the frequency of each word in a finite set of words from in an email like Dear, Friend, Money, ... ?",True

I read your older comments and found you use the dnorm function in R. I used the dnorm to calculate the soda pop probability, but changed from ml to liters and found an answer above 1, the conversion shouldn't change the outcome...surely. Is there an explanation I am missing? My guess is that the width of the dnorm should be scaled according to the size of the distribution ,i.e., mean of 500 shouldn't have the same dnorm with as a mean of 25.

The p(popcorn of 20 | troll 2) is a valid probability, it’s only a likelihood in the sense that we use that probability to evaluate which theta value (loves troll 1 or loves troll 2) is most likely.

@itsfloofles,2021-05-24T17:21:09Z,0,"Hey Josh! Thanks so much for this informal video. I'm currently working on something that needs exactly what you describe here. However there is one thing I cannot find an answer to however hard I try. I sadly can't translate my issue to the example you give in the video but I'll try to make it as basic as possible.  Let's say that we have a couple of boxes that contain a random bunch of items. Some boxes contain similar items to others and beforehand I make some observations on this. I then create some PDFs of for example P(coin | box1). Let's say that I observed coins in a couple of the boxes but some boxes never had a coin in them. If we have a total of 4 boxes our prior would be 0.25 for each box. I observe a coin in the box that I have in front of me and calculate the likelihoods for each box. What do I do if I do not have a PDF for a box then? Because in that case the final likelihood will be off right?  For example: Box 1: log(0.25) + log(L(coin=1|box1)) Box 2: log(0.25) + log(L(coin=1|box2)) Box 3: log(0.25) + log(there is no likelihood!) Box 4: log(0.25) + log(there is no likelihood!)  The log of 0 doesn't exist, but if I simply disregard that part of the sum than the loglikelihood for Box 3 & 4 would be the highest (while intuitively this doesn't make sense!). What do I do? If the probability of a coin in box 3 & 4 is 0 then what is the likelihood?",True

@adamkinsey3139,2021-05-06T21:48:46Z,0,"Error in Video (""Probably"")  Hey Josh, I think you should be saying ""Probability"" when you are saying Likelihood.  I know the distinction can be tough, but they are VERY different, so it is important to get right.  And I believe you explain it correctly in your other video, so I'm surprised to see it used incorrectly here.  When you already have a known distribution (not changing), and you calculate a value for an event based on that (known) distribution, that is a Probability.  ""Likelihood"" occurs when you have some real data, but you're not sure what the ""true"" distribution is that the data came from.  So you take a stab and pick one possible distribution, and then calculate the ""likelihood"" that the data came from that distribution that you guessed.  And seriously, I think that the difference between ""probability"" and ""likelihood"" is as big as consequential as the difference between differentiation and integration, so it's really important to clearly distinguish the two concepts.  Or am I wrong?",True

@hawkiyc,2020-11-25T04:10:19Z,0,"Dear Mr. Josh,  I have taken another course have the following equation for the probability of Naive Bayes,  P( Loves Troll 2 | new data ) = [ P( new data | Loves Troll 2 ) * P( Loves Troll 2 ) ] / P( new data) P( new data ) called marginal likelihood,  and P( new data | Loves Troll 2 ) called likelihood  And then, the way to calculate marginal likelihood and likelihood is to calculate the probability nearby the data at a certain distance, and the distance is adjustable while you are building the algorithm. For instance, there is a circle in which the center is new data and you can adjust the radius if your data is 2-D data.  After watching both courses, I am wondering how can these two equations be equivalent?  I deeply appreciate your time for answering my question.  Sincerely, Gavin",True
