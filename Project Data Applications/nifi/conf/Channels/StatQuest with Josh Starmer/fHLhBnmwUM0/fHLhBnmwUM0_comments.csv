@user-hv6ij5uy4o,2022-11-15T13:24:34Z,1,"GREAT video!!!!!!!!! just a tiny question: many text books and teachers ""ask"" or more precisely ""force"" students to plot normal distributed data using bar plots. but i think boxplots present data bettter no matter the data is normal distributed or not. how do you see? and which do you choose?",True

@matthewcory4733,2021-11-12T13:34:50Z,0,"Intelligence is normally distributed, so George is right. For a normal distribution, mean = median = mode. Godwin, Smith & Warne (2012): ""Like many human characteristics, intelligence is theorized to be normally distributed. However, a vocal minority of researchers and practitioners who study individuals with high intelligence have claimed that there are more people in the upper echelons of intelligence than would be expected if the normal curve accurately modeled the distribution of intelligence scores. To verify this claim we carefully searched articles form the journal Intelligence dated 1979 to 2012, completed an academic journal search and reviewed national data sets for samples that permit this claim to be tested. To be included samples must have been (a) representative of the population that the intelligence test used was normed on, (b) not be the test's norm sample, (c) have at least 1,000 subjects in the sample, and (d) examined subject intelligence using an intelligence test with norms that are no more than 15 years old. This search yielded one such sample. Two national data sets were also identified for use in this review, the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS). We reviewed the information provided from these sources and determined that intelligence is indeed normally distributed.""  https://works.bepress.com/rwarne/4/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median",True

@alecvan7143,2020-06-13T18:00:00Z,2,"This is really a great simple video to ensure students understand what they're analyzing.  Suggestion:  It may be worthwhile to discuss how the whiskers are actually calculated to help students understand that outliers are values that are ""potentially"" outliers and that their interpretation depends on the situation. That way, maybe they would be less tempted to just say ""oh they're outliers, I don't care about those"". In any case, thanks for another great video !",True

@HannesOberreiter,2019-12-08T09:24:59Z,35,"I'm atm. watching your Statistic Fundamental Playlist and loved it so far, but this one I think was not really good. Would loved to see more about how the whiskers are defined, mild and extreme outliners. How the boxplot could give you ideas about distribution and maybe about how the IQR can be used to compare categorical data etc.",True
