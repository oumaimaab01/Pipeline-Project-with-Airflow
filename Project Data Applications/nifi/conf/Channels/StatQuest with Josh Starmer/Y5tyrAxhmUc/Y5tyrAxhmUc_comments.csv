@Shionita,2021-03-19T03:26:38Z,1,"I'm writing a Python course right now, and I've applied most of your rules :o! It must be in my unconscious after watching all your videos :P (I've literally watched like 95% of them). Again, thanks for everything, and I'm 100% sharing this video with my colleagues. And here comes ""the little problem"" with the rule about not using other people's explanations. Back when I was teaching, I couldn't just put your videos in the lesson because, well, they're in english :/... (I'm from Chile, we speak spanish here). So, I just sort of ""translate your explanations"", and leave the original video in the slack channel of the class, like ""hey, this is the original stuff if you want to check... but is  in english"".... bwa bwah.. :(. That happens a lot, I often find good stuff but can't just give them to students ""because is not in spanish"". So, I've been thinking to add subs to some of your vids... When I have time, I hope soon :(... Everybody should be able to get the knowledge you give :).",True
@bogdanexit1,2021-03-18T22:25:09Z,0,"Why you do not explain in excel ? I see even neuronal network explained in excel beacuse de hidden layers etc ....With excell i can vizualize better .

@benlacar2109,2020-07-22T16:00:12Z,1,"Josh, thank you so much for doing this video and for dedicating yourself full time to StatQuest. As others have stated, you're helping a lot of people! This video is great in teaching us for how you convey information. But I'm very curious about the way YOU learn, especially when you see something difficult for the first time. For example, when seeing a complicated equation in ISL, how do you approach learning it until you ""get it""?",True
@PetStuBa,2020-07-22T12:47:03Z,0,"dear Josh ... thank you for your amazing videos already ... for all the hard work ... I have a question for you  it's about standard deviation , there is something I don't understand about it... we know how to calculate it, right?  but I was wondering ""why don't they calculate it the way I'm going to demonstrate you?"" example: 1,2,3,4,5  here the st dev = 1,58.... now comes my idea: we know 3 is the average, all the numbers equal to the average we exclude and then we do 2 calculations: we take the average of all the numbers at the LEFT side of number 3  1+2 = 3 / 2 = 1,5 (on average it's on the left side 1,5 away from average 3) we do the same for the RIGHT side 4+5=9/2=4,5 or 1,5 away from number 3 the average from 1,5 and 1,5 = 3/2 or 1,5 why would be 1,58 be more precise than my 1,5 ????  Do you know the answer or do you have an idea ?  thank you, have a nice day",True

@Erosis,2020-07-20T04:39:15Z,1,"My current projects rely on neural nets quite heavily because there aren't other statistical methods that perform well with audio data.
