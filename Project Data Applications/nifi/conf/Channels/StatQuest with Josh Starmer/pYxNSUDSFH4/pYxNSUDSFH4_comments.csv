@suivzmoi,2018-11-06T15:00:32Z,1392,"probability is the quantity most people are familiar with which deals with predicting new data given a known model (""what is the probability of getting heads six times in a row flipping this 50:50 coin?"") while likelihood deals with fitting models given some known data (""what is the likelihood that this coin is/isn't rigged given that I just flipped heads six times in a row?""). I wanted to add this perspective because using the example in this clip, a likelihood quantity such as 0.12 is not meaningful to the layman unless it is explained exactly what 0.12 means: a measure of the sample's support for the assumed model i.e. low values either mean rare data or incorrect model!",True

@ian-haggerty,2024-03-03T12:20:04Z,1,"I think it's worth mentioning that ""likelihood"" is otherwise described as ""probability density"". We call it a ""density"" as it is literally the probability per unit mass (in this context). This also means that the *unit* of likelihood is the reciprocal of the unit on the horizontal axis, in this case: probability per unit gram.  The choice of unit is arbitrary, and so the value of the likelihood is dependent on the unit of mass you care to choose. This also has a bearing on the numerical values for the mean and standard deviation.  Josh—I love your work! Just offering up my slice for constructive feedback/food for thought / follow-up ideas.",True

@CalledLissy,2024-01-29T15:52:47Z,0,"Now I'm a little confused. From my statistics class I remember: p-value (for example from significance test) is a likelihood and means probability of data given a hypothesis --> P(D|H). (And we learned that Bayes theorem gives the opposite: probability of a hypothesis given the data --> P(H|D)). But in the video it seemed that the likelihood means probability of a distribution given the data (the weighed mouse) --> P(distribution parameters | Data). I think there's no contradiction here, I'm just struggeling to find a general definition of likelihood and probability that's not dependent on examples or too specific terms (like hypothesis).

@siddharthghosh3963,2024-01-02T01:22:46Z,0,"Hi, So as stated in the video, while calculating likelihood, we change the shape of the distribution.

@debayankoley5844,2023-03-10T21:57:04Z,0,"I just want to point out one thing, which I've recently realised. The definition and interpretations of likelihood given in this video are confined within the Classical paradigm. Bayesian school also uses likelihood, and although the structure of likelihood is the same, their interpretations of likelihood are different. That’s largely because in Classical statistics, a parameter (In this case, location and scale of normal distribution) is a fixed quantity whereas data are random. Bayesians consider exactly the opposite. For them, parameters are random and observations are fixed. It can be seen in this way: in Classical statistics, likelihood is the probability that our observed set of data will yield the model parameter(s) whereas in Bayesian statistics, likelihood is the probability that the parameter(s) will generate the data we are observing.",True

I excuse myself with the fact that I'm just driving to the  next block to park my car, and given the fact that I normally use a belt, the probability for a fatal accident is so low. The police obviously claims; ""No, the probability for an accident is equally high all the time you drive your car"", and normally  the police wins the debate here. But.....  He may be right, under a special circumstance.   From my point of view, I will perhaps drive 100000 kilometers in my life, and if I drive ten of them without a belt, the probability for me having an accident ( in my total life span ) during those belt-less kilometers is very low. The police, on the other hand, is talking about the probability for an accident at a given moment. Every second I'm driving, there is a certain probability of a crash. Putting it another way; if I just drive 100 meters in my whole life, the likelihood for an accident is fairly low - even if I'm an inexperienced driver.  It's like the fact that we one day will die.  The likelihood to die young in a heart attack is very low. But as years adds up, it increases slowly, until it one day becomes so high that I'm actually dying.",True

@Julian-tf8nj,2020-10-27T04:56:55Z,0,"*THE* central point of why this distinction/confusion IS even an issue - ought to be addressed by this video: it's because it's a *CONTINUOUS* distribution! If you had a *DISCRETE* distribution, there'd be no such issue: the probability of a fair die landing on ""4"" is 1/6.  You can call it probability, likelihood, odds - _whatever you jolly well fancy!_  [insert British accent] But with a CONTINUOUS distribution, like in this video, ask yourself, *""what is the probability of a mouse weighing 32 grams?""* The answer is... drums rolling... (think about it...) ZERO! That's because you're asking about EXACTLY 32 grams, not an atom more or less!!  What are the odds of that, lol.  So, to have a PROBABILITY value that is actually useful in the _continuous_ case, you must specify a broader ""event"" in your sample space - i.e. a subset of the real numbers in this case, not a single point.  For example, if your scale gives you tenths of grams, and you cared about such minute variation, you could ask about Prob(32.0 <= weight <= 32.1)  LIKELIHOOD, on the other hand, is just the value of the _Probability Density Function_ (often called pdf) - that is the y-value on the curve in this example - at a particular point; if it were a discrete distribution, it'd simply give you the probability at that point (and it'd drop the ""density"" part from the name of the function.)  _Note that the ""likelihood"", unlike a probability, can be any number_ - it's NOT constrained to be between 0 and 1.  For example, imagine a rectangular bell-curve analog, always 0 except between 50.0 and 50.1 , where it takes a value of 10.  The total area under that curve is (50.1 - 50.0) * 10. = 1.0 as it should.  So the likelihood in that scenario is always 0, except when it is 10.",True

You need no random variable, no distribution to talk about a probability measure. On the other hand, given a random sample, likelihood for me is a function on the parameter space of the distribution which maps a parameter THETA of a distribution to the probability mass or density function (where the later exists) of obtaining that specific sample from the distribution with parameter THETA. So for me, likelihood is a function that takes values using probability mass or density. I'd not try to compare probability with likelihood, as the later clearly uses probability in its definition.

In the case of continuous random variables it cannot be the same as probability because pdf are not always restricted to the [0,1] interval (for example, the Chi-square distribution with 1 df). So, the 0.12 in the example shouldn't be interpreted as a ""probability"". What are the units of measurement of likelihood? It's hard to say. In the case of discrete random variables, likelihood and probability are ""the same"" but I am not sure if we can interpret the values of the likelihood function as a probability. Finally and curiously, in most applied examples the maximum loglikelihood is usually a negative number, which is consistent with a joint probability restricted to the interval [0,1], and this occurs in the case of discrete and continuous random variables.",True

The nice thing with this is that you don't need to differentiate between continuous and discrete PDFs. But since you are a mathematician you already know these things.) The term ""likelihood"" needs to be further specialized. The (log-)likelihood of the parameters, theta, is the function L(theta) = log p(x | theta, ""other stuff"").

According to your mathematical definition likelihood is mathematically just a special case of probability, where the weight range is zero, which makes it a meaningless concept in the real world. If you count the number of mice with a certain weight, you always need a weight range. With a weight range of zero there would always be just one mouse with the exact particular weight, so you would never get a distribution curve. In the real world we can only deal with areas under this curve, never with points on the curve. In order to count thr mice with the same weight, we would need a tolerance range for considering mice having the same weight. The distinction between probability and likelihood makes therefore no sense, since likelihood would not be an applicable concept in the real world.",True

But had to give up on that when I realized that I didn't have quite the ""Talent Level"" that my peers who were going in that direction had.  Paul Erdos I'm not.    A friend told me (please understand that this was in the mid 70s), ""You're going to need AT LEAST a Masters Degree before you can go out and beg for a job. And in all likelihood, not only will you will need to write a Thesis to get that Degree, but you're going to have to pick a topic VERY Soon after you start your Masters Studies AT THE LATEST or you will be light-years behind your classmates. Most of them will have chosen their Thesis Topic during their Undergraduate days."" The only topic I can recall having had Any interest in at that time was the Navier-Stokes Equations.  But, I have seen where so-called ""Authorities"" argue about whether this is a physics or a math Equation. So much for that. Also, tried to read background material on the Hodge Conjecture and it might as well have been written in Sanskrit.    Also, I was told, ""If you can't get a job as a Mathematician or a Statistician, you can always be a teacher."" Yeah right...  I can honestly say that I never had even ONE teacher that ""inspired"" me in any Method, Manner or Fashion. And the number of teachers I would have loved to hire the Columbine Boys to ""take care of"" is Easily in two digits. So I sure as heck wasn't going to become one of them.   Lastly, given my Life-long Hatred of school in general (me and Evariste Galois, among others), I saw that going into Accounting was a viable alternative, in that I was able to get a job with just the (then) four-year Bachelors Degree. The day I put all school in the rear-view mirror for Life, I remember saying, ""This is how prisoners who just got paroled must feel.""    All that aside, to this day Math and Statistics remain two of my favorite hobbies. Since I was Lucky and Blessed enough to have been able to retire five years ago at age 55, I have all day, every day, to do what I LIKE to do, rather than what I HAD to do to survive.

@suivzmoi,2018-11-06T15:00:32Z,1392,"probability is the quantity most people are familiar with which deals with predicting new data given a known model (""what is the probability of getting heads six times in a row flipping this 50:50 coin?"") while likelihood deals with fitting models given some known data (""what is the likelihood that this coin is/isn't rigged given that I just flipped heads six times in a row?""). I wanted to add this perspective because using the example in this clip, a likelihood quantity such as 0.12 is not meaningful to the layman unless it is explained exactly what 0.12 means: a measure of the sample's support for the assumed model i.e. low values either mean rare data or incorrect model!",True

@RabidMortal1,2018-11-04T18:24:18Z,5,"I am slightly confused. I have always been taught that the likelihood of a model is the probability of the data given the model, but the notation uses is always in the form of P(Data | Model).  this is the opposite of how the video is presenting it.",True

@budasfeet,2018-10-07T07:02:52Z,1,"I don’t think you are right “probability” can also be a single point, it’s not just the cdf. And likelihood depends on the context, it’s p(x|y) in p(x,y)=p(x|y)p(y) which reads posterior=likelihood times prior in Bayesian statistics.",True

@DmGrass,2018-08-26T17:57:13Z,23,"I am a little bit confused concerning the second examle because this is probability density function, not cumulative distribution function. Probability density function has probability density (not probability itself) on vertical axis. So why did you conclude that likelihood is 0,12? In my opinion, this is probability density. In order to see likelihood we have to swich to cumulative distribution function and look what Y-value correspondes to 34 grams.",True

@19HM98,2018-03-10T11:53:04Z,0,"Here's what I have understood from this, please correct any mistakes:  With likelihood we are asking how likely it is for a certain statistic to be a particular value, given a particular case.  For example, how likely is the mean to be xyz, given that our case has value abc.  For probability it is essentially the reverse. What is the probability of a case being abc, given that our mean is xyz.  Is that correct?",True
