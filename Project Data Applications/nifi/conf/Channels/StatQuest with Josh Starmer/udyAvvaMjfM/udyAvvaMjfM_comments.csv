@statquest,2020-01-31T11:23:31Z,28,"Correction: 4:15 I say getting 7 oranges and 1 blue is just as rare a getting 7 blues and 1 red. This is incorrect, since there are more blues and oranges in general than there are blues and red. However, the idea that we add up rarer events is correct.  Here's the R-code: data <- matrix(nrow=6, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,                 data=c(1, 5, # red                       0, 6, # yellow                       0, 8, # orange                       0, 9, # green                       0, 5, # brown                       7, 8)) # blue  fisher.test(data)  Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! https://statquest.org/statquest-store/",True

@jordan7386,2024-03-07T20:52:13Z,0,"This may be an obvious question, but how would Fisher's Exact test be applied to word frequencies in two datasets (i.e., corpora)? For example, let's say there are 5 instances of ""stats"" in Text #1, which has 100,000 words, but 75 instances in Text #2, which is 200,000. My field previously used chi-square and LL for this kind of test, but a researcher proposed Fisher's Exact test as a better alternative, and I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it.

@ocm6382,2023-08-10T16:43:09Z,0,"Hi Josh, I love your channel. I have a question for your interpretation of the bag.   Your p-value for your draw of M&Ms is 0.01, which is below the standard threshold for significance.   When evaluating the meaning of this value however, is it more accurate to say that your bag is special, or that your draw is special?  Best,      -OC",True

@arpaddanos9416,2023-06-17T01:18:43Z,1,"The histogram you show from the internet that has 8 blues etc, from the standard bag, is of course just the means I assume from a large sample of bags. (rounded to integers as well). But what if your handfull had been 10 blues and 1 red? then you cannot use the system you showed to calculate the probability right? Thanks for the great videos",True

My situation would be like M&Ms are in different colors, 40 colors. Then let say I pick up 8 M&Ms, and I get red as in the video (ignore another colors). I would like to know how rare that I randomly pick 8 M&Ms and get red.  So, I repeat the test for 100 times and out of 100 times, I get red M&M only 3 times. Then I want to know the P-value of getting 3/100 times red M&M. Is it possible to calculate?",True
