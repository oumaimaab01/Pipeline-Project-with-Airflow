I am currently making a statistical model analysis for a machine learning algorithm, but I am super confused with what should I consider as True negative and False Negative.  Because the algorithm makes only positive claims. Patient comes and has a disease A, but the System shows a Disease B. What's that?  A FN or a TN ? I am absolutely confused, and I'm taking a long shot here.",True

@henryhsu9517,2024-03-24T02:23:56Z,0,"Thank you Josh. This tutorial is amazing. I have a question about the number of parameters.  In the LSTMbyHand model, there are 12 parameters. Instead, there are 16 parameters in the LightningLSTM model. My understanding is that  [wlr1, wpr1, wp1, wo1] could be viewed as  lstm.weight_ih_l0, and, [wlr2, wpr2, wp2, wo2] could be viewed as  lstm.weight_hh_l0, and,  [blr1, bpr1, bp1, bo1] could be viewed as  lstm.bias_ih_10.  Is it correct?

For example, company A goes up from 0 to 1 in 4 steps. Why would a model expect it to come down to zero the next day? If I were to guess, I would expect the value to remain high for day 5, and even if it reduces maybe go to 0.5 from 1 since the previous jump down was from 0.5 to 0.25.",True

Wonderful experience. Josh is an excellent teacher. I have no previous experience with neural networks, but after watching these videos, I feel ready to experiment with NN.",True
@supermandrew88,2023-05-04T14:59:07Z,1,"Hi Josh!  Sorry for another question.  I've got a dataset that is slightly more complex than the stock example data you used here.  I'm trying to use LSTM to predict the result of a sales lead before it runs.  For each data point, I've got: the sales rep, the date of the lead, the product pitched, the zip code, and the result (sold or not sold).  I've already got my program set up to evaluate different encoding methods for each of those variables.  After watching this video, I'm trying to visualize how I would use my data in an LSTM.  You created two arrays of data: one for company A and one for company B, where each index in the array corresponded to a date in your dataset.  So for my dataset, I can create n arrays of data, where n is my number of sales reps.  My issue arises in the fact that I have an uneven amount of data points per date.  For instance, sales rep Bob was able to run 3 appointments on May 1 and 1 appointment on May 2.  Likewise, sales rep Alice ran 0 appointments on May 1 (I guess she's off on Mondays), and 4 appointments on May 2.  How would I preprocess this data for an LSTM?  I'm assuming each data point would be an array of encodings: [sales rep, product, ...], but if one rep ran 4 leads on a day and another ran 1 (or even 0), do I just ""pad"" my data with a value like -1?  So on day 2, Bob might be: [[encoded data point 1],-1,-1,-1], and Alice is: [[data point 1],[data point 2],...] ?  Finally, I noticed sequence length wasn't really included in this video.  Is that because our sequence length is 1 in this case?  Do we still capture temporal relationships with a sequence length equal to 1?  Sorry for the lengthy question.  I appreciate any insights!  P.S.  I hope you create a 2nd StatQuest book that includes topics like LSTMs, Transformers, etc. I'd love to buy it! ðŸ˜Š",True
@supermandrew88,2023-04-28T20:00:09Z,1,"Hi Josh!  In your introduction for the sample problem you mention that we're looking at stock prices for two different companies: A and B.  If A and B didn't share the same values for days 2, 3, and 4, would you still use one LSTM model for both stocks?  In other words, when would you instead choose to create a separate model for each stock?    I'm sort of looking at a similar example problem: sales reps performances over time.  Would you include all the reps performances in your dataset, or would you create a different model for each rep?  Thank you for your time!  Your book just arrived at my house a few days ago.ðŸ˜„",True
