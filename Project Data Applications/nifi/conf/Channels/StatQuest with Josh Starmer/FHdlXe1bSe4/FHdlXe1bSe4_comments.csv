@shamshersingh9680,2024-04-22T01:36:59Z,0,"Hi Josh, thanks again for allowing me to break the ice between me and Pytorch. Everytime I see your videos, I wonder if my instructor could have taught us like this probably our lives must have been much simpler and happier. I have a small doubt here. In the example you have shown gradient training of only final bias. But in reality, all the weights will have to be trained during backpropagation. So when I try to initialise the all weights with random values and then train the model, I do not get the final weights as shown in the video. The code is as follows :-   class BasicNN(nn.Module):      def __init__(self):         super().__init__()          self.w00 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)         self.b00 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)         self.w01 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)                  self.w10 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)         self.b10 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)         self.w11 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)                  self.b_final = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1), requires_grad = True)      def forward(self, input):                  input_top_relu = input * self.w00 + self.b00         input_bottom_relu = input * self.w10 + self.b10         output_top_relu = F.relu(input_top_relu) * self.w01         output_bottom_relu = F.relu(input_bottom_relu) * self.w11         input_final_relu = output_top_relu + output_bottom_relu + self.b_final         output = F.relu(input_final_relu)          return output  # Create an instance of the neural network model = BasicNN()  # Print parameters print('Parameters before training') for name, param in model.named_parameters():     print(name, param.data)      # Define inputs and corresponding labels inputs = torch.tensor([0., 0.5, 0.1]) labels = torch.tensor([0., 1.0, 0.])  # Define a loss function  criterion = nn.MSELoss()  # Define an optimizer  optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)  # Number of epochs for training epochs = 1000  # Training loop for epoch in range(epochs):      total_loss = 0          # Forward pass     output = model(inputs)      # Compute the loss     loss = criterion(output, labels)     total_loss += loss      # Backward pass     loss.backward()        # Compute gradients     optimizer.step()       # Update weights     optimizer.zero_grad()  # Clear previous gradients      # Print loss every 100 epochs     if (epoch + 1) % 100 == 0:         print(f""Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}"")      if (total_loss < 0.00001):         print(f'Epoch = {epoch}')         break  # Print final parameters print('Parameters after training') for name, param in model.named_parameters():     print(name, param.data)  # check the model performance input_doses = torch.linspace(start = 0, end = 1, steps = 11) output = model(input_doses)  sns.set(style = 'whitegrid') sns.lineplot(x = input_doses, y = output.detach(), color = 'green', linewidth = 2) plt.xlabel(""Input Doses"") plt.ylabel(""Effectiveness"") plt.show()  Request if you can help me with the code above.",True

@pauledam2174,2023-08-05T17:15:03Z,0,"Amazing job! I plan to donate to your patreon page. You were confused because we could use .backward on loss (or at least I was confused by this). I guess one explanation is that loss is defined in terms of output_i and output_i is an instance of the model class. So it may make sense that we can access the backward attribute of loss. But I was, for the same reason a bit surprised that we can subtract a scalar from output_i. One other question. Wouldn't it be better to take the average of total loss? Otherwise the condition that uses 0.0001 is dependent on the the number of examples in the training set.",True
@frankyang442,2023-07-09T09:39:03Z,0,Thanks for teaching in such a simple way !

@chriskovalik906,2023-06-30T16:46:23Z,0,"I think there is a bug / flaw in this program: I cannot get this code to backpropagate the entire neural network properly unless I move the optimizer.step() and optimizer.zero_grad() *inside* loop <for iteration in range(len(inputs)):>. As written, it is only inside the <for epoch in range(100): > loop.  (Note: With SGD it takes a ~500-1100 steps with a lr of 0.035 to consistently work with randomly generated weight values.)  With my fix and using Adam instead of SGD and a LR of 0.02 I can do it with fewer steps (150), but also sometimes much more (2500). Not sure why that is.",True

@aayushjariwala6256,2022-04-26T10:16:31Z,4,"It amazes me, when I see no NLP video on StatQuest! Josh your explanation are always higher than what one can expect and you have created so many series including maths and conceptual understanding. NLP has the same importance compared to computer vision and actually people are suffering to learn it by lack of content availability! I hope you would create a series or maybe a few videos on basic concepts which help people to get interested in NLP : ) Hope you are doing good in life Josh",True
