Please don't lose your pedagogical angle to your videos. My wish for a future video series would be one covering Bayesian Structural Time Series - I think these models are very underrated from the causal perspective (the best (and most entertaining) introduction I have been able to find is: https://youtu.be/SW_gbFg1F2w).

@HamidrezaFarhidzadeh,2020-01-07T21:06:19Z,0,"This is my understanding of data science. It is mainly data mining and working with structured data. Working on tables, let's say using pandas would fit in data science. One very little portion of data science is machine learning which is selection of classifier, not much effort to parameter tuning like we have on deep learning. Long story short, the focus is on structured data debugging. Being said that data scientist  and computer vision scientist wouldn't fall in same category.   The machine learning learning is about model debugging and model tuning. E.g what would be the best selection of cost and lambda for RBF-SVM? What would be the best cost function for my deep learning model in respect to data distribution? What would be the best cost function for my model? so on and so forth. Machine learning focuses on shallow models with one transition (hidden layer) to map input layer and output layer.   Deep learning is focusing on models with more than one hidden layer, in other words, stacked model.",True

@jaliu,2020-01-07T14:40:05Z,0,"TRIPLE BAM!!!  Josh, your videos accomplish everything you set out to do. I was pressured to enroll in a stats degree and really didn‚Äôt know what was I was getting into. I had forgotten everything related to statistics and math and found out that I would have to know what I originally only learned computationally on a deeper level in order to succeed. The instruction has been almost entirely mathematical and not only am I struggling but every time I go to class and read the lecture slides I start to hate the subject. I don‚Äôt understand the mathematical notations and formulas and there are no examples, no enthusiasm in any of the instruction. I‚Äôve thought about dropping out all the time because I‚Äôm miserable and can‚Äôt catch up. When I watch your videos I wonder why I‚Äôm struggling so much. It doesn‚Äôt seem difficult at all and is so cool!  So first, I want to thank you for everything you‚Äôve done. Second, your channel is quite new so it takes time for you to release new content. Time that I don‚Äôt have. Do you have any tips, suggestions for how I can learn up to the masters level what you haven‚Äôt covered? Are there any great resources you can recommend? Any advice will probably change my life, literally.   I didn‚Äôt know you were having a livestream, would have definitely tried to make it! Thanks again!",True

Can you please go with first time series then deep learning and neural network, Why I thought to tell you this because time series is more near to maths as compare to deep learning.
