According to the description in DESeq2, the p-value seems calculated from ""negative binomial GLM fitting for βi and Wald statistics"". I wondered is this the same concept in the video? Is negative binomial regression also a kind of general linear model, and the variance of the negative binomial  (μ+α μ^2) same with to the SS(Mean) and SS (fit)?  Also, is Wald test the same with the t-test in the video, except that n is large in Wald test? Sorry for asking so many questions, I'm so confused.",True
