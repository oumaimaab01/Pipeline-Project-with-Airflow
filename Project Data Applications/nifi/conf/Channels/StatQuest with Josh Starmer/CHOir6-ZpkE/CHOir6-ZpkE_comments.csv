@RockstarRacc00n,2022-09-04T22:15:27Z,1,"It's interesting that the video that brought me here was on Stoicism, and the second thing you said was like, ""when you read about someone who sounds crazy, remember, you can always learn something"", which made me think of Diogenes, ""the Dog of Athens"".  When you first read about Diogenes, who was the ""pop"" to the guys who invented Stoicism back in ancient Greece, he's this crazy guy living in a barrel, wandering the streets with a lantern in broad daylight, plucking the feathers from chickens and demanding Plato accept them to his school...  ...then you come to realize he was not only brilliant, he was LITERALLY THE GREATEST philosopher in all of Western philosophy, possibly the history of the human race: he and Socrates are the only two philosophers whose teachings are still relevant in the modern era.  His teachings were the backbone of Stoicism, his rebuttals of Plato and insistence that Plato was an idiot using the teachings of Socrates to look smart were so ahead of their time they're now just entry-level philosophy, and his way of life was this example that still reverberates to this day when we talk about ""what we really need to be happy.""  ...but he SOUNDS insane when you first hear about him, because he was just so far above everyone's level that he didn't care what people thought about him.  He'd found his answers, and he was living his best life.",True
