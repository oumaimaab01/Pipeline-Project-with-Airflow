@AG-cx1ug,2024-03-15T11:15:33Z,0,"Did we finally get the final equation as at 7:40?  Both are just area under the curve? Width wasn't being used before 11:00 - we were just using the specific outcome x, how did both width and specific outcome come in the final equation?",True
@AG-cx1ug,2024-03-15T11:11:24Z,0,At 11:13 why is there still an x value at x * L(X=x) * width? Wasn't the x the width?,True
@AG-cx1ug,2024-03-15T11:03:42Z,0,"For each rectangle shouldn't we be multiplying the likelihood value by 10 and not 20,30? Since the area is just between 10-20 or 20-30?",True
@AG-cx1ug,2024-03-15T10:25:12Z,0,What if the data is erratic and doesn't fit with any of the lambda values to make the curve?,True

@samieweee7468,2024-01-22T06:12:47Z,1,I am a bit confused is the value in y axis the likelihood of meeting a person after xth seconds or the number of people we meet after x th seconds cause during initial explanation the dots at each x were number of people we met after xth time.,True

@iroikoarakide8990,2024-01-15T14:23:51Z,2,Why do I have to attend college classes when you explain these concepts so thoroughly and in a third of the time? Great video as always man you are a Godsend,True
@megasun,2023-11-06T19:57:19Z,0,"Number is not right around 8:25, the rectangle area should be approximate 0.3894. I was very surprised that the given rectangle area of 0.4 is bigger than the given integrated result of 0.39, because the rectangle area looks slightly smaller than the area under the curve ... still I love these videos. And of course, for the purpose of this lecture, having more digits here is distracting and not helpful.",True
@alexandersmith6140,2023-10-20T20:28:48Z,1,"Hi Josh. What video(s) after this should I watch to get closer to understanding why we divide by (n – 1) when finding the sample variance and sample covariance? An intuitive explanation for this seems nowhere to be found across the entirety of the internet, and the StatQuest channel has thus far been a divine gift of comprehension.",True
@adampotter760,2023-09-08T12:25:34Z,1,What the next video to watch to find out the elusive reason for dividing by n-1!? Please reply!,True
@SunSan1989,2023-09-05T16:10:34Z,1,"I watched all the videos carefully, but why can't I find it? Why choose n-1 instead of N minus 2 or n-0.5?",True

I'm waching the full playlist ""statistics fundamentals"" and have to admit that since I understood all of the previous videos thanks to your great explanations I was lost on this one when you used integrals :/  I think it's the video that requires the more calculcus knowledge.",True
@tauqeeralitapya6447,2023-04-14T20:28:51Z,0,"at 9:39, why are we multiplying 20 with 0.2 and not 10 as the interval is still 10 between 10 and 20?",True

@homunculide8567,2023-01-04T21:38:03Z,0,"Thanks for that and another videos with all that useful explanations... I'll keep binge watching. Regarding your explanation at 10:06... The second term and all following appear wrong to me, because the intervals are 10s each and not 20s, 30s, 40s... this the area of the rectangle should be likelihood x 10(s) for all terms (discrete rectangle) You are the expert but I can't wrap my head around that.",True

@TJ-hs1qm,2022-02-27T21:43:43Z,0,ahh... how come that Likelyhood and Probability actually mean different things ? 🤷‍♂️,True
@user-ff5bi8ey1b,2022-01-12T20:47:11Z,1,1) Why cant we just take average of all waiting times to get how much on average we would wait? 2) How often in real life we can use some sort of formula like exponential to describe a distribution? I think in most of the cases we can use NN to fit the distribution,True
@tedchirvasiu,2021-12-19T07:57:45Z,3,"5 years later: if you watched this video hoping to learn exactly why we divide by n-1, you are one step closer to understanding this mystery, but not quite there yet.",True

@oraciopozzo8694,2021-11-27T18:44:45Z,0,"When you approximate  the expected value it is confusing that you add areas whose base is not the constant 10 interval. The areas of the  rectangles should be in your example variable height given by the formula times 10 and not 10, 20, … Otherwise the rectangles are meaningless.",True
