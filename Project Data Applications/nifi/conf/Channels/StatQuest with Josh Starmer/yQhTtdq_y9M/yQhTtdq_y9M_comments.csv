@Uynix1978,2017-11-01T16:07:08Z,125,"I have been a modeler for 11 years.  I really like your expression about ""model is a relationship"".  Just want to add a bit of my point of view.  To me, statistical model is a relationship derived from examining the data using statistical theories.  The relationships from these models usually can not derive from a physical law.  Whether or not the relationship is linear/nonlinear/exponential/log, they are all pure speculations based on data.  There are also physical models, such as modeling the speed of a car according to its weight. These are also models but the relationships are derived from the physical laws (in this case, Newton).  Also in engineering, there are lots of empirical models, where the relationships ranges from non-physical to semi-physical, such as Manning's equation.  Part of the model can be explained by physics, but part of it is not.   Just my two cents to share.",True
