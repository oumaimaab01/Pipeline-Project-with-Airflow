I did a master's in music in China. Now, I am preparing for a PhD in Economics and many think my background in music has ruined my career... Love passion for music and mathematics makes me happy :)",True

Thank you very much for sharing! Looking forward to more STAT videos(a life saver for me and my bioinformatic friends), new songs and cats!",True
