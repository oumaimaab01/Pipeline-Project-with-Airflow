@taotaotan5671,2022-10-07T01:32:10Z,0,"Hah, very interesting topic!  From a statistical perspective, the one hot encoding is doing something slightly different from a design matrix.  A Design matrix always set the first column to 1, used as the intercept/baseline.  Regardless, design matrix conversion and on-hot encoding produce a matrix with the same rank - so they are the same in some sense.",True
