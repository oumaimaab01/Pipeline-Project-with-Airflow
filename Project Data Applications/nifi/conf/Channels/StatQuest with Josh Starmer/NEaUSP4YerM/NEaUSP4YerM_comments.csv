@arenashawn772,2024-02-10T22:19:16Z,1,"t-SNE in concept is a little dense to me so I am watching this video multiple times to think about the nitty gritty of it‚Ä¶ I have three perhaps very naive questions so far: 1) with really high dimensional feature space for some data, how do t-SNE algorithms decide how many dimensions to use for the simplified data? In PCA it can be specified by inspecting the variance of data in each of the components to decide that new feature‚Äôs ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù in grouping/separating the datapoints, is there a similar measure that is used to decide how many dimensions are used in t-SNE? 2) Why is it only used as a visualization technique and not a true dimension-reduction method for data pre-processing in machine learning pipelines? 3) is it possible that the data do not converge in low dimensional space (i.e., you just could not move the second matrix so that it is similar enough to the first one)?  I dug out the original 2008 paper from SkLearn citation and  as usual was amazed by how you explained the fairly abstract idea in section 2 of the paper in a mere 20-minute long unhurried video, down to the analogy of the repelling and attraction of mapped data in the low dimensional space (the original paper interpreted the gradient decent method used to locate the low dimensional mapping of points as ‚Äúsprings between every point and all other points‚Äù)  ‚Äî no important detail is lost in your video yet they are organized in such a way that they follow a clear logic and do not overwhelm.

Similarity Score = Distances between points converted/related to Probabilities -> pdf of points on pdf curve = Unscaled Similarities  -> Scaled Similarities  = Similarities of data are normalised regardless of spread (variation)  STEP 2)  CREATE NEW ""PICTURES"" ON A NEW (REDUCED) DIMENSION  For each and all data points, position data against other such that the new similarities scores (i.e. the probability score) follow the original similarities score.  Objective: Find the new values for each data points (in the new dimensions) such that the difference between the resulting new probability distribution and the original probability distribution is minimised.  The origin original distribution is (assumed?) Normal.

@JamesSCavenaugh,2020-03-06T07:48:20Z,0,"At 9:15 or so you say that it doesn't really make sense for a point to be similar to itself, so t-SNE defines this as 0.  Huh?  It makes perfect sense to say that a point is 100% similar to itself.  To convert an arbitrary (Euclidean, Manhattan, whatever) distance to a similarity, where the distance d is 0 <= d < +Inf and the similarity s is 0 < s <= 1, the formula is s = 1/(d + 1).  So a distance that is 0 units from itself is 100% similar to itself.   Also, your explanation for why a t-distribution is used is to prevent the clusters from clumping up together.  Wouldn't any unimodal univariate distribution work?  What's special about t instead of Gaussian, Laplace, ...?",True

Based on my understanding of the concept, the blue cluster then should have density ""twice"" as the purple cluster such that the normal curve of a blue target point is ""half"" as wide as the normal curve of a purple point.

@janiobachmann5029,2018-04-06T23:59:03Z,0,"Thank you Joshua for this amazing video! I just want to make sure I understand, so basically t-SNE determines the clusters in the high dimensional data then  takes it ""randomly"" to the lower dimensional data and it tries to follow the patterns made in the high dimensional data. The only thing I was a bit confused at the end is what does the algorithm do at each step that it moves the point closer to the other clusters? (where you show the two matrix) The matrix to the left was all mixed up and the one to the right was organized due to the scaling scores we previously did. So how does the matrix to the left (lower dimension(1-D)) learns from the matrix to the right (higher dimension (2-D))? I hope you understood me but anyways Joshua best video on t-SNE in youtube.
