@statquest,2020-11-11T18:25:26Z,295,"Correction: 4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

@yeqingw5508,2022-02-14T19:38:09Z,0,"Hi Sir, great video again, but I have some confusion when I think of where the bias and variance come. I read other people's definition, some will say bias is the simplifying assumptions a model make to learn target function more easily and variance is the amount of change that estimate of target function by different training data. These definitions look quite different from yours. They come from the view of making a target function, but yours, variance talks about changes of the consequence, the predictions a model made, the bias is the consequence of how far model with true relationship. I just got confused, and try to find the connection.......",True

Now I realize ""bias"" and ""variance"" are properties of models wrt future data:  When a model overfit on the training data,  its performance on a random test data is unpredictable,  so it has a high variance.  On the other hand, when a model underfit on the training data. its performance on a random test data would not change a lot (probably equally bad, so we say bias is large), so it has a  low variance.",True

@KristoferPettersson,2020-12-08T18:38:02Z,0,"At 2:23 you say that the inability to capture the /true/ relationship is called bias, but  then in 2:51 you say that the squiggly line which is hug at fitting the data points has little bias. The data points are not on the line and the squiggly line does not match the /true/ relationship of your light blue arc. This is a bit confusing. I suppose that if you fit your data points in the training set you have high bias for that subset of the data set because mean errors are low? But if you use the same model on the test set you will have high variance for that subset of the dataset because the mean test scores are high. Also, I wonder, most of the time we'll never know what the true relationship when we do ML, so is there any point in anchoring the definition of bias and variance to this unknown rather than to just the available observations?",True

@statquest,2020-11-11T18:25:26Z,295,"Correction: 4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

@Dekike2,2020-09-10T18:56:27Z,0,"Hi Josh!! First, thanks for your videos. By the way, I bought one of your t-shirts, they are cool :).  Can I ask you something in line with the concept ""bias""? I don't know if this video might be a solution to my problem. I am doing my PhD and one of the things I want to do is to discuss about if a method of obtaining data is biased. Let me explain with a simplified example: I have measured the activity of an animal in continuous over 1 day at time windows of 60 seconds, so then, I have 1440 activity values of my individual. This was done using ""Technology A"". Then, using another technology (""Technology B""), I got random samples for those same 60 s time windows and for the same day. Let say I got 200 samples. My ""big"" question is,  is the method ""B"" biased in the way it obtains activity data? Method ""B"" used acoustic signals to send data, and I suspects that my animals' behaviour influences the type of activity data I obtain through the method ""B"", because when my animal is hidden the acoustic signal is not received by the receiver (satellite, etc.). In my case, the activity data distribution is sharply non-linear for both sources (A and B techniques), with the majority of the values close to 0 and then, the further from 0, less frequency of values. What did I do? What I did so far was to run a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon Test) to check if A and B activity values belong to the same population, and if not, then I run a ""greatest Wilcoxon Test"" to test if B > A. I think that the Wilcoxon Test accepts unbalanced samples. However, my colleague says that he is not sure that we can talk about bias here. Given your expertise in statistics, Could you tell me if I can talk about bias in my case? Or, is there a way to do the analysis to be able to talk about bias in the method B? I would really appreciate your advice a lot... I am desperate!.",True

So the original problem was to find a classification point to find drug usage limits that cures or doesnt cure the disease. When we increased the value of 2, you mentioned it introduced a second dimension. I understood, how squaring the value helped to find a better Marginal classifier line, but ideally there is no meaning to the y axis here right, because the case still remains the same. We are just finding if the drug usage had a positive or negative impact. we could still use the y axis to determine its efficity, but if we increase the value to 3, what would Z axis represent here.

@sudeshnadutta5702,2020-02-02T10:35:50Z,0,Hi Josh. Great Video. Just one question - let me know if my understanding is correct or not. Bias basically occurs in the training data set when we compare the sum of squares for the train data. and when we compare that with the sum of squares on test data we understand variance. So what I am trying to figure out is for bias how do we mathematically calculate. like you mentioned we calculate sum of squares for figuring out variance. so what do we calculate exactly for bias?,True

@marijkhan435,2019-03-19T10:52:00Z,0,"Great video. One question. You said the sum is squared so negative distances don't cancel out, but doesn't the distance formula already account for that? The distance would never be negative, regardless of whether it's above or below the line, due to the formula:  d=((x2‚àíx1)^2+(y2‚àíy1)^2)^0.5 Please let me know if I missed something.

@ausrace,2018-09-18T13:43:03Z,1,Minor point but you are not fitting a squiggly *line* to the training data. More like a curve or maybe I'd call it a function? I realise this is preparation for a bigger topic and you are just getting the idea across.,True

@StephenRoseDuo,2018-09-17T21:37:38Z,1,Another great video (and song)! but the only thing I would like to nitpick is that the residuals aren't squared in the objective function to ensure the negative values don't cancel out it is so the estimated value at a given value X is the mean. (If you wanted me to sound fancy I would say MSE lets you get the conditional mean of y given x or expected value of y even x),True
