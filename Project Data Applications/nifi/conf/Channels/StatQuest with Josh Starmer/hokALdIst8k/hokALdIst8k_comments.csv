How do we quantify the cost (eg. increased error, reduced R-sq, some other more interpretable business metric) of not using weight? Because I believe practically, people don't make decisions based on p-values alone but there must be some translation to more practical factors along the way.  For the 1st two metrics (error and R-sq), must we re-run the model by redefining the RHS of lm() each time we want to test a different predictor combination, or we can say something about the results of other predictor combinations from the summary() of 1 experiment alone. (Seems like both are true, which is contradictory). What would you say about the 3rd metric? (translating p-values to practical considerations) I'm also not sure if using tail alone definitely leads to a worse/equal result (as measured by error, or some other metric) than tail + weight?

@anthonysun2193,2020-08-15T23:43:10Z,1,Hi Josh - Thank you for your video tutorial.  I used your data sample and ran a simple regression (size ~ tail) and got a  marginal slightly higher Adjusted RSQ (0.808 vs 0.800) and a much lower P-Value for the tail slope (0.0006 vs 0.0219) compare to the multiple regression (size ~ weight + tail).  Does that make sense?  Does that mean we can just use a simple regression instead?

Well, I would like to propose you this:  we are given these woooowww Bioinformatics books, you know, data mining for Bioinformaticians, Introduction to Bioinformatics, introduction to Genomics and Proteomics... and well, I will be honest as for my sensation: I think that their writing style fails to get the reader to the point. We spend the whole day on half the chapter and at the end of the day we have acquired no knowledge and we just got tired without any particular reason. I mean, their stat approaches are qualitative (for example, there is no k-means algorithm or the way it is explained makes no sense) and since an bioinformatician has usually no background in ... Biology or Medicine, we cannot understand what stat method should be used when. Things became really hard in Biomarkers discovery and it seems that 'incomprehensible' stat methods outcrop (something like Rambo, who would suddenly appear from inside mad, imagine something like that). I mean, from a qualitative perspective, all angelic. But not sure about the whole stat procedure.  Would it be as a fatigue for you to make some videos on ""When we (should) use what?"" ?

@patelprateekramesh2442,2019-07-25T06:43:49Z,2,"Could you please answer one question?   I did the SLR for Tail and the p-value was very small (0.0006) against 0.003 for MLR. The variance in R2 was also minimal (0.83 for SLR and 0.85 for MLR). In such case using only tail to predict mouse size seems better and it matches your inference.   Now I believe the comparison method shown in the MLR video would also apply to two MLR (one with lesser variables). In such case is it better to carry out the the comparison technique you showed  (the one where we compared SLR and MLR to find comparative R2 and p-value)? Or surmising the same from the p-values of each variable of the MLR summary would suffice? Here i believe we can get the p-value but still need to check R2 and would need to carry out another MLR with reduced variables anyway.   If so, is there way to carry out the comparative method in R?",True
@sumitdangat8159,2019-06-19T18:53:58Z,1,Hello Josh please help me to understand below points:  1. If we are considering p value to identify whether variable is significant or not then why don't we remove weight from final model.  2. After adding weight and tail in model our p value is significantly improved what is the reason behind that? 3. If combinations of weight and tail improve model then weight also needs be significant why it is not?  Thanks in Advance,True
@chickenpax1,2019-05-31T15:04:05Z,1,"Hi Josh, thanks for your videos, they are very helpful.  I am a bit confused.   Isn't the explanation at 6:30 backwards? When you have the red square on weight, isn't that line saying you are seeing the effect of weight on the size adjusting for tail? If this is the case, then the formula below should be the following: we are comparing the complex model where ""size=y-intercept + slope1 *  weight + slope2 * tail"" to the simple model ""size=y-intercept + slope2*weight"", not tail.  Wouldn't this be right?     And likewise, at 6:55, that's telling you the effect of tail on size controlling for weight.    I am a graduate student and I am preparing for a talk where I have to talk about my data, and I use linear regression to model effect of genotype and treatment on certain behavior scores. In case they attack me on my analysis, I'd like to be able to interpret just about every line that R puts out, which this is part of.

@joerich10,2018-05-25T23:43:26Z,3,"Hi Josh -  I'm confused. In other video on linear regression you mentioned that when fitting a 'plane' in multiple regression, if adding a second variable doesn't reduce the SSE (i.e. explain more variation in y) then the coefficient of var2 would be set to '0' and the equation essentially ignores it.  But this video seems to say something slightly different - that is, if an additional variable doesn't add more explanatory power, then OLS will still assign a coefficient value, but the p value of that coefficient will be high signifying that the variable isn't significant.  One way to try bridge the difference, is that the second variable still reduces the SSE (i.e. line fit is better using the plane vs simple line), but that if we plot the second variable alone on a line, the residuals (errors) would be so large that we're not sure if the pattern we're seeing (desribed by the coefficient) is due to pure random chance. Have I got this right?",True

What makes me think is that since weight  and tail length are highly correlated, I would think using either one of them in the model is fine and these two predictors are interchangeable.   But the results showed otherwise.  I am wondering what might have made the difference?   According to the previous lecture, I am guessing it is because that the sum of squares of the weight-only model is significantly bigger than the sum of squares of the tail-only model?  Also, I remember there is a terminology about multicollinearity that if one predictor is highly correlated with the other, in multi-regression the matrix inverse will fail.  I wonder if there is any indicator in the output about multicollinearity here.",True
