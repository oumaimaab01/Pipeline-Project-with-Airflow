@dihancheng952,2023-03-27T15:13:37Z,0,"This is a summary of the video, generated by OpenAI Whisper API, for those who don't have time to watch the entire video.  In the past week, we've seen a lot of activity in the AI business world. Google has invested 300 million dollars in anthropic, a company that develops large language models. Microsoft has introduced Bing Chat, a chatbot that can have conversations with users and provide up-to-date references. Google's chatbot has been criticized for getting a factually incorrect answer, which caused the company's stock to drop. Microsoft, on the other hand, is perceived well despite its chatbot's weird interactions.,The text discusses the potential benefits of Google investing in anthropic technology, in light of the recent problems Microsoft has had with its chatbot. It is suggested that Google may be better equipped to deal with the issue of aligning their models, due to their experience with artificial intelligence.,The text discusses how Google's AI technology is lagging behind in comparison to other companies. Google is trying to catch up, but it is difficult because they have to meet high expectations. The author suggests that it may be helpful for Google to spin off their AI technology into a separate, independent startup.,The text discusses the idea that large language models can be used to learn algorithmic reasoning, and that once this logic is learned, it can be applied to solve problems that are not related to language. The author notes that there are many small startups that are using the open AI API to build their models, and that this is likely to multiply in the future.,The text discusses how businesses can leverage existing data and tools to create new, innovative products and services. One way to do this is by fine-tuning existing models to better fit their domain, or by prompting the model with specific domain-related questions. Another way is to reach out to external sources of information, like APIs, to get the data and knowledge they need.,The text discusses the three different ways that AI can be used to generate knowledge. The first is prompting, which involves taking the output of an AI and aligning it to a specific field. The second is training the AI on a small set of domain-specific data. The third is training the AI from scratch, which requires a large data set.,The text discusses how a proof of concept is more important than a perfect model for a startup, and how investors will be excited by a product that is flexible and allows users to be creative. The author also mentions that the cost of entry for AI startups is low, and that the biggest challenge is finding the right market for the product.,The text discusses the changing landscape of the coding industry, and how the barrier to entry for creating innovative products is lowered by the relatively easy ability to prompt models to do hard things. It encourages people to play with these models and see what they can do with them, as they have the potential to change the dynamics of the world as we know it.",True
