I see it as ""find the number of features that show clearly the classification of the data"". It's like assuming hidden features but without taking them into account. It's pretty weird but feels beautiful, am I on a good direction or totally wrong on the interpretation ?  A problem I see though with that I said is that kernels operate as there is a correlation or causation between the features, but if we think of your example a hidden variable could be the age. And age is not caused by drug dosage. Or maybe we can interpret it as the relation between the age and the drug dosage on a patient with regards to effectiveness ? It makes sense again now but i'm not sure, there might be uncorrelated variables explaining variation in a third variable, would SVM work in this case ?",True

@AG2009to2013,2021-08-10T20:03:08Z,1,"Hello Josh! Thanks for this StatQuest!  Could you please clarify several things: 1)  In case of perfectly separable 1-dimensional data, how can we exactly determine criterion which we use in order to determine the point of Maximal Margin Classifier?  Is it correct to say that the point of MMC is the point for which the smallest of (1) and (2), where  (1) is the distance between rightmost red point and MMC (2) is the distance between leftmost green point and MMC is maximised?  2) In case of perfectly separable 2-dimensional data, we can not only move but also rotate the separating line. And for different a and b coefficients (where a and b are coefficients from the line equation) the observations closest to the line can be different. However, in any case we try to find such a line (such a and b coefficients) for which the smallest of (1) and (2) will be maximised where  (1) is the distance between closest observation of Class 1 and MMC line (2) is the distance between closest observation of Class 2 and MMC line is it correct?  3) In case of not perfectly separable 1-dimensional data, when we need to use soft margin, how does cross-validation exactly works? It seems that what we need to do is to take all the possible combinations of two observations (one from Class 1 and another from Class 2), calculate the midpoint for each combination and check how good all other observations are classified. But how this process works with K-fold Cross Validation? I have no idea how to combine the process I described and the process of CV :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((",True

@WechselWissen,2020-10-01T09:18:53Z,0,"Hello,  first of all, thank you for your great videos! Your outstanding way of presenting the content really does the trick for better understanding and remembering.  I've got a remark / question to this specific video. At 19:22, you say that the kernel trick *avoids* the transformation, and only calculates the high-dimensional relations.  Maybe I'm wrong, but as far as I understand the concept, this is an inaccurate description of what is happening. In my opinion, the benefit of the kernel trick is simply, that it does not execute all transformations at once and then stores them in the computers memory. Instead, it only calculates the transformation pair-wise, which is definitely needed in order to calculate the high-dimensional relations. So the transformations actually do get executed, but way less memory expensive, enabling the method of support vector machines to be used on large datasets. The amount of computation per se is not lowered.  Looking forward to your answer :)  Greetings from Germany!",True

But, without seeing the test data, how does the SVC decide the appropriate number of misclassifications to allow? 1? 5? 100? Is it another hyperparameter that we tune or via cross-validation? And finally, what is the guarantee that variance will reduce in this case (I can understand the case of linear-vs-squiggly function in your YouTube video on the same topic but here, it's all straight lines, right)?  And like always, thank you for doing what you do. Bam. Hope you are safe and sound, wherever you are. Double bam.",True

If the two points are of the same class, you replace both points with a point which is exactly in between them. This procedure eliminates outliers very well and you remove redundancy from your dataset which leads to a smaller dataset. By doing so, you can actually use nearest neighbour classification with pretty good results and controllable processing load.

A couple algorithmic questions:  1) I know the support vector classifier only requires the dot product between each pair of points in order to be fit: how exactly is this used to fit the support vector classifier (i.e. what is the algorithm used) ?   2) I get that the soft margin allows misclassification, but how does this actually improve training? How are training point support vectors scored? e.g. If a support vector point has class 0 but is labeled during training as class 1, is this just not treated as a misclassification?",True

@grimslade0,2019-11-09T16:23:50Z,5,"I was sitting there desperately trying to revise and cram in all content before my postgrad Statistical Machine Learning exam. I then heard a scratch on my window, I was in disbelief upon realising it was Josh! In my awe-struck state I fiddled about and managed to open the window, Josh climbed through. ""How did you get to Australia so quickly?"" I shakenly asked. ""Non-linear models"" Josh answered, of course it was non-linear models, how could I forget such a sim- ""Don't be embarrassed, we're all noble adventures on the Quest of Stat"" Josh kindly said. I was nervous at this point, I didn't really know what to do, but I felt Josh's presence to be a benevolent one. Josh then approached and whispered in my ear ""double bam"", and we were then immediately sent to the astral-hyperplane in which we skipped around in checking out representations of models in 4d, 5d and even -3d realms.. I cannot describe such a place, it was beyond human comprehension. I still question whether or not I was meant to see such a realm, but regardless I have faith in Josh. After what felt like an eternity, Josh told me it was time to return to the 3d, regular plane realm, well he reminded me that it's still a hyperplane but because it's ordinary to not worry about that.. but that's not the point. I asked if I would pass my exam and Josh said that he classifies it with a high likely-hood. I also asked if anyone would believe my story and Josh said ""no bam"". I then woke up at my desk, and 5 minutes had passed since Josh supposedly arrived at my window. I guess I need more sleep.  By the way, great video. You're a legend Josh!",True

By that I mean, isn't the value d preset to n + 1? (where, n indicates the dimension of our initial data). For example, if our data were 2D, the kernel function would have to compute (using Cross Validation) the relations between each 2 obs of our data in the (2 + 1)D = 3D and, then accordingly to those computations, create the hyperplane? (I feel sorry in advance, in case that I did not grasp this part of the video well enough before posting this question)  2. Bonus Question  Do SVMs *only* create the (n + 1) supplementary dimension, or they create more of them, according to our initial data?  P.S.

@Aklidien,2019-10-05T06:05:08Z,2,"Hi Josh - I would like to say a huge ""Thank You"" for what you do. These videos take an amazing amount of work and expertise, and I really can't think of any other medium that comes close. Even when the math is above my level, I can follow ""small bam"" / ""Bam"" / ""BAM!"" and pick up the nuances from there. So in short - thank you for what you do, your material could cover 4 years of college 5-times over, and I appreciate the monumental effort you put into these videos. THANK YOU!",True

@junaidbutt3000,2019-10-01T23:13:43Z,0,"Fantastic video as always Josh. You‚Äôve made a tricky concept super easy to understand. I particularly loved your explanation of the kernel trick - the fact it doesn‚Äôt do the transformation of the data but computes pairwise distance as if the data were transformed.  I wanted to ask about the support vector classifier. When we have data that is mapped to a higher dimensional and a support vector classifier is fit, don‚Äôt we have a problem in that the classifier is not fit to the original data but a higher dimensional form? I don‚Äôt see how you can scale the classifier down to the lower dimensional case to classify new points?  My impression is that when new data points are added, they too are transformed to the higher space via the kernel trick, checked against the support vector classifier, classified in the appropriate class according to the high dimensional case? Could you please clarify if the classifier gets mapped back to lower dimensions and if so how or does the classifier stay in higher dimensions and the data gets mapped to higher dimensions?",True

I have a recommend, can you do a video of how to learn a package in R. I mean, the way we can deeply understand about one package. Because when watching people practicing in R I just follow them but hard to know how they can know about those codes. And can you introduce the method to update the latest knowledge in statistic and machine learning world?",True

@alexanderscoutov,2019-10-01T01:59:12Z,1,Thank you for the intro to SVM. I always forget the maths behind SVM such as Lagran'ge duality and KKT conditions which I get asked about at job interviews. I have no idea why interviewers ask for the equations rather than knowing the concepts and where to retrieve information in 1 minute. Maybe I'm just too bad at this stuff and should memorize more.,True

If all it does is raise the data to some n-th power, I just picture increasingly steep curves, but no way to draw a line that would put all the islands together like at 19:53. Am I wrong?
