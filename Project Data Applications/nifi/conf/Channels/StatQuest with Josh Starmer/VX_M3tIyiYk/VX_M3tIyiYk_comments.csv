P-values are the threshold for false positives, to be able to say ""we have a 5% tolerance for getting the wrong result"" - that's already pretty meta. Then FDR and the BH-method look at ""distributions of p-values"" to sub-divide the true positives from the false positives. Double-meta. Now on top of that we are doing a ""power analysis"" to get an 80% chance of trusting our p-values? Triple meta? We already set our tolerance of 0.05, saying ""we know we'll get it wrong 5% of the time"" so why do we then care about if those 5% are true/false or ""close enough"".

@Zombiezzz101,2022-10-26T05:00:09Z,0,"So just to be clear. At the end of the video it's shown that we need a sample size of 9. If we go over the sample size of 9, we may run into p-hacking. If we go under 9, we will be less confident in our results thus our power decreases. So my question is what is worse, obtaining a lower sample size or obtaining a higher sample size than what is recommended? I've always assumed that obtaining the largest sample size possible is the way to go since it will give you a closer estimate of the true population mean. Is this not the case? Is there always some ""goldilocks"" sample size number that should always be computed before running a hypothesis test? Thanks",True

In an A/B testing scenario, we don't know the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of the treatment group before hand. We do know the mean and the standard deviation of the prior distribution. If I want to estimate sample size required for different effect sizes, holding the chosen p-value threshold constant at 0.05 and power at 0.8, how would we do that given that we don't have s2 or standard deviation of the second group?   2. Also since we don't know the mean of the treatment group's distribution, how would we calculate the estimated difference in means to plug it into the formula for effect size?  3.

@Happy.Traveller,2021-06-19T06:27:02Z,0,"I don't understand the overlap part. You look at the line plotted (one dimensional) by the normal distribution, not the area (two dimensional) under the curve. Overlap should be then where the LINES overlap, no? Because a point is made of 2 parts in a coordinate, the X value and Y value. Say the X axis is number of people and the Y axis is the number of days to recover, then at any given X value, when you go up vertically to see the Y value of either green or pink graph, it will give you 1 and only 1 unique Y value, except at the point where the 2 lines intersect. In other words, you are not looking at anything in the shaded region, you are looking at the points along the curve of the distribution. Please explain.  As always, I hate statistics and it never makes any sense.",True

@mikaelfiil3733,2021-06-11T12:01:01Z,0,"Nice videos Josh. One thing concerning p-values that I think should be mentioned is, that they are a continues value, so 0.05 is somewhat arbitrary. In terms of p-hacking and the notion of correlation vs. causality, taking 0.05 too seriously as evidence can be troublesome. You may actually miss out on some good science, just because the p-value was > 0.05 and of course, you may be too optimistic in the other direction.  Maybe you already mentioned this, and I just missed it :-)",True

We can easily choose alpha and power, but what about effect size? It seems to be the thing that you are able to calculate after the test finishes, you can't set it up beforehand. Or maybe you meant something like 'minimal effect size that is enough', e.g. from business perspective?",True

One criticism here, however, is that the final computation of the necessary sample size to achieve the desired power could have been covered rather than telling a student to find an app on some university’s web site.

@shikoot,2020-09-25T12:12:47Z,0,"Dear Dr. Starmer.  Imagine I run a pilot test with 5 subjects in each group to get an estimate of the estimated mean and standard deviation from each group, so that I can compute a power analysis. The result of the power analysis suggest that I should run the test with at least 15 subjects on each group. Question: Do I need to measure 15 new subjects for each group or can I reuse the data that I already have (5 listeners on each group) from the pilot test? Is this statistically fine or it is considered p-hacking? And it is an strict no-go or it is not recommended but it is ok? In some research fields, getting data from few subjects is very time consuming and expensive, therefore discarding it must be well justified. Could you share your thoughts about this?
