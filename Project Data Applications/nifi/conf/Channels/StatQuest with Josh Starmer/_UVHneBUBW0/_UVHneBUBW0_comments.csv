I can see hope for the finish line of my Ph.D.! God bless youuuuuu Josh! So in my case, I am using bulk cell (RNA seq). So, instead of it being ""cell"" I'm looking at, it would be patient, for each gene? The summation of all the patients trancript reads for that gene for a average amount, and thus a plot.

The last little bit got me thinking ‚Äî eigenvector is the term to denote a vector that is unchanged (except by a scalar factor) under a transformation in some coordinate space (often expressed as a matrix multiplication) in math, and usually it is specifically called the eigenvector of that matrix. I am wondering (since these names in different fields that math applied to are never chosen without referring to the underlying math principles) what (transformation) matrix these eigenvectors are referring to?‚Ä¶ Maybe it is a pointless hair split and I am just spinning my head on something irrelevant, in which case please feel free to ignore this question.

@TheDVMster,2021-10-25T04:25:14Z,0,"Thank you .  This has gotten me farther in understanding PCA than ever, but I'm still hung up on one thing.  Hope this is not a dumb question - but if it is, I still don't understand it, so...   So PC1 is basically the variation in read count for n genes in one cell, and PC2 is the same for cell 2 (put in order 1,2 by which one has the greater variation).  Cell #200 would be PC200, right?   So what I'm not getting is when you place the final point in the PC1 v PC2 in that scatter graph of cell groups, what are you plotting for for cell 10 or cell 200?  PC1 (x) v PC2 (y) is not making sense to me, because those came from the first two cells.  How do you calculate a PC1 and PC2 score for cell 200? (since it is PC200). Do you do a cell wise comparison for each individual cell?  And, if so, what other cell do you compare it with.  Am I just missing something obvious?",True

Edit: 8:40 Dimensions = Cells. So that means cells are the variables, whereas the genes are sample of data subject?  Q2) For non cell-gene example, the variables can be different things (e.g. age, heights, travel distance etc.), to plot the cell-vs-cell 2D graph, I would have to first normalise all the variables to the same scale.

@veronikaberezhnaia248,2021-10-01T09:10:09Z,0,"I have a question about eigenvector in the end: isn't it more like in a way that every number of this weight or influence in an eigenvalue ? And the eigen vectors are (EV1, 0, 0, 0...), (0, EV2, 0, 0, ...) and these are kinda coordinate vectors in new, ""rotated"" space after PCA?

For those who have the same confusion like me:   I tried to consider Cell columns are features of a Gene, but actually it's just in the opposite manner.   I guess it would be helpful if the table was drawn with Cells as indexes and Genes as columns so that we know Genes are features(components) of any Cell. A data point is a cell with Genes as its vector.  Here is my understanding regrading PCA in general:  Intuitively, we plot a PCA to research correlations by comparing significance sum(influence) of all the components of a datapoint to other datapoints.",True

@wesNeill,2020-03-03T20:45:48Z,0,"So what are the random variables here? I'm used to thinking about matrix rows as representing the variables at play, while the columns are individual samples/realizations of those variables...

@junchen4606,2020-02-24T00:53:13Z,0,"Hi, thanks for the video. Correct me if I am wrong, the dimensions that needs to be decreased in this problem should be genes instead of cells. So basically x, y, z axes should represent, say, gene A, B and C. And each point in the 3-D plot will represent a specific data point, which is an actual cell here. There is no meaning cutting dimensions for cell numbers, since it is just the number of your sample size. The essential idea for PCA is to reduce the number of independent variables, not sample size.

It would result in also an easier conversion from the initial plot to the final plot;  We got all our cells plotted and now we plot them on the PC1 (if we want to keep 1Dimension) and then just classify the groups via a clustering method....  Also it doesn't make sens that the maximum variance between gene1 and gene2 is relavent, because gene1 might stand for something as cell thickness, and gene2 for something as cell reproductiviness, this is comparing apples and pears...",True

Hence my question is if  you go back and compare the genes in the cell (eg take the cells in yellow area and compare the significant effect) or just tell by some other way. Thank you.,True

But if you add another cell, don't you gain another dimension and another principal component? how can you plot it in a 2D graph when with another cells you get another axis? Is it because PC1 and PC2 usually covers most of the total variation? (we willingly ignore PC3 because it covers a small portion of variation?)",True

In the slide at 17:53, you say ""Genes with the largest variation between cells will have the most influence on the principal components."" But earlier, at 9:12 or so, it looks like the genes at each end of PC 1 actually are fairly similar between cells (i.e., the ones in the lower left are low in both cell 1 and cell 2, and the ones in the upper right are high in both cell 1 and cell 2). Wouldn't we want to find genes that are high in some cells and low in others? Can you give me a better intuition for this? (Is it just an artifact of the simplified visualization?) In interpreting the loadings of PC1, is it safe to say that variables with high absolute loading values are the ones that vary most between observations (cells in this case)?",True

@jreimer3462,2017-06-12T21:13:02Z,0,"Hi, Joshua! I have a question just to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. If PC1 and PC2 are always the dimensions with the most and second most variation, respectively, how can similarity be determined? Different groups would have different PC1s. Is that where loadings come in - adjusting for loadings causes samples with similar principal components to cluster together? For example, if there are 200 cells with genes a-f, and the PC1 for 50 cells primarily lies along the axis for gene a, and the PC1 for another 50 cells is primarily along the axis for gene b, would these two cell groups cluster in separate areas of the graph? If, say, Cell 200's PC1 was primarily along the gene f axis, would it be an outlier from the two groups, assuming no other cells had similar PCs?  Sorry if the question is way off. I'm just trying to understand how if there are 200 cells with n genes, where any combination could be PC1 in 200*n dimensions, how each of these principal component combinations is separated from others that are in an entirely different dimension in the final 2D graph. I hope I articulated my question well - please let me know if there's something fundamental that I'm missing that makes my question make no sense at all. It's hard to think in more than four dimensions haha",True
@stevenvandersyppe,2017-06-09T12:00:25Z,0,"at 10:46 As the PC2 is the smallest possible arrow you can plot. Doesn't that make it the axis with the least variation instead of the 2nd most variation?

You obtain the PC1 and PC2 (axes) by plotting cell 1 and cell 2 and then rotating it to get a clear image of the variation. However, it seems here that PC1 depicts the most variation in read count in cells 1 and 2.  In addition, assuming that PC1 does not only depict the varation in cells 1 and 2, wouldn't adding cell 3 change the influence/loadings of the genes in PC1?  Thank you!",True

I have a question regarding something that you did that maybe helped understanding this matter:¬†why are the reads of a gene plotted on a ""cell coordinate system"" instead of the cells plotted on a gene read system? is there an advantage in starting in that representation for the data and then ending in the ""principal component axis"" plotting cells as points? sorry if¬† for bad gramar, english not my first lenguaje.

Dear, Joshua, I just have little question, related regarding it interpretation: if we have third cell (on time 17h35 of the video)  with PC1 = 8 and PC2 = 3, these cell #3 will be closer to cell 1 (red), because it is closer on the PC1 axis (suggesting that PC1 equal 60% and PC2=30% of data variation). Am i right ? But in these case, is there any form of visual data visualisation, which can confirm that ? ( Because visually cell 3 would be look very similarly close to cell2 and either to cell 1).
