@mccdiego9275,2022-09-29T18:11:39Z,0,"Hi Josh, thanks so much for the helpful videos. They are great! Two quick clarification questions if you don't mind. At 3:54 when you say that this process repeats until the clusters no longer change, the thing that is ""repeating"" is picking three new starting points, correct? Pick three points, perform the clustering, find the means, cluster around the means, stop when clustering around the mean doesn't change the original clusters. If the clusters DO change when clustering around the mean, the part that is being repeated is going back and selecting three new starting points...correct? My second question is about the elbow plot. Why wouldn't we select K=4 if we just previously said that using K=4 gave lower total variance within the clusters compared to K=3? I understand picking the elbow of the plot, but I guess am confused on why the sharper decrease wouldn't be observed at K=4 if we just said that K=4 has lower variances within the clusters than K=3. Or is the point of the elbow plot just to show you roughly where adding more clusters stops being as beneficial? Thanks so much!",True

In few other tutorials they calculate mean whenever a new data point is added to a cluster.

@ScottMain,2021-06-11T17:56:23Z,0,"Almost nailed it. I had a hard time figuring out what you mean by ""best clustering so far."" You never seem to explain how it decides the best. It has to do with the ""total variance,"" but you don't say exactly how. After rewinding to various points and then staring at the illustration at 4:20, it seems the best clustering is the one that, when you add up the distances between points within a cluster (variance within a cluster), and then add all cluster variance together, that total number is the smallest among all clustering attempts. I only got to this because your illustration showed the ""best"" clustering was the smallest (horizontally). So great work on all the illustrations and animations. :)",True

@andylee4000,2021-05-14T12:28:56Z,0,"Thanks for your excellent videos.  I do have conceptual question.  K-mean is a classification technique where we applied statistics rigor to data/factors.  However, conceptually, is it any different than if we were doing the classification via applying weighting factor?  Let‚Äôs say, we have 10k array or people in the sample and each array has 100 factors.  We can do a K-mean cluster to classify/group the sample.  We can also assign weight (eg 1% for each factor or any permutations as long as it adds up 100%) to each and every 100 factor to group the sample.  Sure the math and outcome will be different between the 2 approaches.  However, why cluster is more appropriate than the straight forward weighting approach?  The only answer that I can come up with is that cluster is letting the data sample to determine the grouping but weighting approach is the human have to pre-determine the weight first.  Is this the only difference?  I am trying to explain to my colleagues the difference between cluster classification vs weighting approach.  We get the how part and we are wondering the why part.

I have one question about the elbow point at 5:51    Is there a formula that determines that the elbow point is at k=3, or does one just have to eyeball it?   Maybe one can find the difference in the slopes of the line segments on either side of each kink (each k value). It looks like k = 3 would win at that game. Thus k=3 is the elbow point. Is that what one should do?   Thanks again for everything! You're videos are teaching me stats and data science like no one else can!",True
