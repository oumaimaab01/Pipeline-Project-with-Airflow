As the slope here is parallel to the x-axis, it can be easily seen that the value is 0.  To be honest, my ideas and intuitions in calculus are very low and maybe I'm wrong.

A better way to explain it is that if we use absolute, we won't be able to tell how well the data is spread from the mean than using the square. The reason is coming from the case A when data has even space from the mean and the case B when some data has very large space from the mean but the rest has small space from the mean. If both case A and B give same result variance value from absolute formula , then we won't be able to tell accurately how well data is spread out . However , by using square, case B will give bigger variance than case A. That's why square is preferred.

@vasily2780,2021-07-01T12:36:09Z,0,"I'm having trouble understanding the concept here. Is it to say: ""no matter what sample we take, there will generally be a bias towards a smaller variance than the true population variance, thus this is arbitrarily compensated by dividing the estimated variance by a smaller denominator""  The sample variance could be both smaller or larger than the population variance based on how the sample is taken, which would give a certain sample distribution (of many possible SDs). So I don't see the logic of comparing distances between sample points and sample mean vs sample points and population mean. (we can look at variance as a squared ""distance"" from a selected point such as the sample mean).  Edit: So basically what i'm trying to say is: What is presented in this video simply states that the minimal sum of distances from any sample to a point would be the sample mean which is logical.

It just explains why we should subtract some value to begin with, but why 1? if you got 10 million data points, subtracting by 1 doesn't change the sample mean very much. Whereas if you only got 5 data points, it means a great deal. So why not make the value you subtract proportional with n? Like subtracting 10%, or 15%? I understand the more data points you have, the estimated mean is going to become increasingly closer to the population mean, but there's no way subtracting the convenient value of 1 from n is what gets you the closest to the population mean in the majority of cases.",True

You argued that the right hand side is greater so that we need to make the left hand side larger by dividing n-1.    However, the right hand side is not the actual population variance. The actual population variance should be using a much larger n to calculate.   What we are doing here is to estimate the population variance but not the right hand side.  Thinking to this point, all the linkage seems broken. How can I relate the right hand side to the population variance?  It is true that the inequality holds.

@cl3826,2019-07-25T03:37:18Z,0,Wait... didn‚Äôt you only show that xbar minimizes var? You didn‚Äôt show why we need n-1 for the population var,True
@libertarianPinoy,2019-07-24T19:45:23Z,10,Kids today are so lucky they can review their stats online like this with great teachers.,True
@anujlahoty8022,2019-07-24T10:53:34Z,7,Awesome and the best video with most simplified explaination.,True
@pablogarciaseminara6560,2019-07-24T02:41:20Z,1,BAM!!!,True
@eddy147Tennis,2019-07-21T21:23:50Z,1,"Question: why is it that the differences between the data and the sample mean is less than the differences between the data and the population mean? If I take the most extreme data points for the sample mean won‚Äôt I have a bigger variance for the sample data? P.S. I agree you need to get some award, videos are fun, educational and clear.",True
@did8446,2019-07-20T08:44:15Z,1,But how to show that sample mean is smaller than population mean?,True
@paulpaschert6215,2019-07-18T08:11:50Z,272,is there some sort of award we can give this guy? please?!,True

@andersonbessa9044,2019-07-17T14:12:51Z,1,Your videos are so helpful,True
@fernandoaloisiohm,2019-07-16T22:52:28Z,1,"You gave an amazing explanation about why dividing by n underestimates the population variance. Your videos are awesome, i love them. I just don't get why n-1 to find the unbiased estimator. Is that because of degrees of freedom thing? Sorry about my english, and regards from Brazil.",True
@jhfoleiss,2019-07-16T13:27:57Z,0,"Hi Josh! First of all, thanks for the excellent explanation. I have a question when n is a large number. This is often the case in Machine Learning. For practical purposes, does it still matter if I divide by n or n-1? Usually we normalize data with z-score, that relies on the average and standard deviation... Thanks!",True
@haugstve,2019-07-16T06:43:26Z,3,"Nice! PS. Small typo at 8:42, you say -1 but write x-1.",True
@redangrybird7564,2019-07-16T01:49:51Z,1,I am no statistician but it's very interesting. Thanks.         ‚úåüòÅüëç,True
@keysky_1622,2019-07-16T01:28:18Z,6,wow that n-1 has something to do with E(X)? Im waiting for it!,True
@apoorvshrivastava3544,2019-07-16T00:50:52Z,0,"please update your new video in your website ,it become messy to watch video in sequential order",True
@mahboobalam5689,2019-07-16T00:23:01Z,1,Great as always! Thanks Prof.,True
@arbanafal,2019-07-15T22:56:34Z,18,"I have nothing but admiration; this is the clearest explanation that I've seen so far that does not shy away from the underlying math, yet still keeping it understandable for those with minimal math background. I feel like a bit of a fool when I see the contrast between my own attempts to explain this correction factor and your explanation.",True
@rodrigohaasbueno8290,2019-07-15T21:27:48Z,2,I think i love you.,True
@vkvkvkvk,2019-07-15T19:04:15Z,38,baaammm! subscribed.,True
@GbUnLimiteD,2019-07-15T18:46:33Z,13,Yes! I had already feared that the n-? question won't be explained. Glad to hear that you will explain this unsolved mystery in the next video!,True
@Drugio24,2019-07-15T18:42:53Z,4,this is literally what I was trying to get a clear understanding on in the last few days? what are the chances? no seriously what are the chances?,True
