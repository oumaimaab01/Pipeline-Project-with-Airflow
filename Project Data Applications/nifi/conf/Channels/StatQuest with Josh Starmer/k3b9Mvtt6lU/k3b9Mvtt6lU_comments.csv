@petersq5532,2023-12-30T01:38:28Z,0,I just wonder if you ask the algorithm to write something for you how does it became your creation? how do someone dare to say: it is my song....  people replace their own creativity with algorithm. yeah if you dont have mich.... but the long term problem is that creativity is a trait needing practice and training. if you dont use it you lose it. iv you replace your mindwork with AI than you lose in a long run,True

@dihancheng952,2023-03-27T15:10:43Z,0,"This is a summary of the video, generated by OpenAI Whisper API, for those who don't have time to watch the entire video.  Luca and Josh discuss the potential of GPT-3 to help people with creative tasks like writing songs or brainstorming ideas for a book. Luca shares how he used GPT-3 to write lyrics for a song, and Josh talks about how GPT-3 could be used to generate names for a show.,The text discusses how the chatbot Chachi PT works. Chachi PT is a GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) that has been conditioned to chat. GPT is a model that is not easy to understand, but it can be written in 300 lines of python. The model is trained on a massive amount of data, and then it is fine-tuned to interact with people. The model is ranked by another model, which is trained to rank the output of the big model. This ranking is done by humans, who say which output is better than another. The ranking is then used to improve the parameters of the larger model.,The text discusses how large language models can be used to generate text, and how they are capable of learning algorithms to do so. It also notes that these models are becoming more common and that they are getting better as people learn how to use them more effectively.,The text discusses the development of quantum computing, and how it has made it possible to understand code and create algorithms that can be executed at inference time. The author also talks about the importance of diffusion in this process, and how it has led to the development of sound generation.,The text discusses the use of attention mechanisms in neural networks, and how they can be used to improve image generation. It also notes that these attention mechanisms can be expressed in a few lines, which makes them easier to understand and work with.,The text describes the Transformer architecture, which is a way of learning non-linear relationships between input and output sequences. The Transformer is efficient at learning these relationships, and this makes it a powerful tool for tasks like image recognition and text classification.,The text discusses how Arabic numerals are more efficient than Roman numerals, and how this efficiency can be used to improve neural networks and AI. It also argues that products which remove the need for conceptual boilerplate will improve people's lives.,The text discusses the idea that it is often only when we see the full context of a situation that we are able to understand it fully. This is compared to the process of translating a sentence, where it is only when we see the full sentence that we can get an accurate translation. The author suggests that the same principle can be applied to notes, and that it is only when we are done adding to them that the structure becomes apparent.",True

@IvanGarcia-cx5jm,2023-02-22T22:47:24Z,1,I found it very ridiculous that in the BBC Humans series an engineer was surprised that the humanoid was only made with 15k files or lines of code. I found that silly. It smelled like a rule/heuristic based system to me.  Here Luca mentions that a small version of GPT has around 300 lines of code. Make sense on how DL/RL work.,True
@Larzsolice,2023-01-25T17:28:39Z,0,"Sometimes it is easier to think of neural networks as neurons that light up (rather than being a line or plane drawn on a graph representing the intensity of each neuron).  So when a neuron lights up, it represents some sort of abstract cluster of the data. The sum of the neurons (output) is like the weighted sum of abstract components (the sum of the intensities of the neurons).  This paradigm comes from visual processing using neural networks, which has the fascinating side effect that visualising the neural network in the case of digit recognition allows you to intuitively see what is going on.",True

@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2023-01-11T21:51:17Z,22,"These models aren't going to put people out of business. They will make the people good at their jobs much better than people who are average. The more your skill level, the more you can specify the prompt and fine-tune the final result. I will do a more thorough breakdown of it soon, but an analogy that you might  appreciate is the publishing of the sklearn library. That library lets anyone write ML models easily. In that way, you could argue that it theoretically lets my grandma replace me. However, the reality is reversed. Because the implementation headache of writing the models is handled for me, I can spend time working on the actual problem at hand. More domain knowledge and technical skill will actually allow me to do much more, than someone blindly using ChatGPT w/o the underlying foundations.",True
