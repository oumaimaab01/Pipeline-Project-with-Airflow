@a.lex.,2024-05-15T13:49:10Z,0,"Hi StatQuest, you said that by scaling the inputs between 0 and 1 it makes the math easier, but what would change if the inputs were not scaled. Also great series of videos :))",True

@iReaperYo,2024-04-29T18:40:48Z,0,"Hi StatQuest, something I don't understand is why you put examples through the neural network to 'fit' the curve to the training set. Wouldn't applying a neural network with initialised weights inherently fit the training set? is this just for illustrative purposes to show that the curves can be formed through putting examples in to our function and getting an output /prediction back?  is this essentially the simpler way to explain neural nets without explicitly showing us the equations that each activation would represent? or are you essentially plugging in the examples one would use to compare to the ground truth values in the test set?  You're essentially showing us visually what curve the *current* parameters approximate /estimate to match the underlying function. But you're doing this step by step? are these curves you're getting fits of the test set?",True

For example when i train using model.fit with equal loss weights, the output is good for heatmap, but binary mask output is wrong and gives pixels 1 for the regions similar to heatmaps. And when i train using gradtape loop, the output is good for segmentation mask, but heatmaps are wrong and looks like masks.  how can i solve this, please give me your suggestion.  thank you",True
@andersk,2022-02-14T15:23:56Z,1,"Hi Josh, thanks again for an awesome video. At 8:13 you mention that these values for width are obviously scaled, so you would do the same with a validation set or a prediction set - is there no potential issue with the scaled new observation being a minus number? Really shooting in the dark here, but I'm thinking maybe somewhere in the neural network there could be a situation where taking away a very small width would be a number close to zero, but if you now have scaled negative values, the two minus signs would go to a plus and maybe incorrectly classify this flower with smaller petals than any in the training set as one with bigger ones because it went past the training limits?",True

Do the outputs refer to probability values? for eg, at 13:07 does the output value of 0.86 mean there's a 86% chance of the flower being a Versicolor, given this particular sepal and petal width? If so, is there a special case (distribution?) where the output probabilities sum to 1?   2) Does the number of inputs play a critical role in choice of any key component in the architecture - like which loss function to use? or which activation function to use?, etc.  3) At what point in an n-dimensional crinkled hyperspace does the universe go n-BAM?! just kidding. not a real question :D",True
