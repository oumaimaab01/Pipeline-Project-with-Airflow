@ezequielpulicari6734,2024-02-27T13:40:22Z,0,"Hiii. I would be glad to read a paper about this. Yesterday I was searching and I didn't find any paper talking about biological vs technical replicates in RNA-seq. If I have to make a decision, I would do it based on a paper",True
@hossainadamzad5907,2023-07-11T12:28:06Z,0,Thanks. you mean that the biological variation cancels out the technical variation?? and that is why we should have biological variation???? did i get it right??,True
@liuliu2292,2022-11-12T17:27:55Z,0,"Hi Josh! Love your songðŸ¥². If I passage the cells grow in one dish into 3 dishes, Let them grow or give them the same type of treatment. Harvest each RNA from one dish as one sample.  Send that 3 RNA samples to seq. Is these biological sample or technical samples? Thank you !",True
@muffinman1,2021-07-22T11:28:17Z,1,"great explanation, something RNA-seq world needs to come into terms with.",True
@daniellau9777,2020-09-29T00:22:27Z,0,What about pooling several technical replicates from one biological replicate together?,True
@Pongant,2020-07-13T06:25:04Z,4,"As a master student I have to thank you for your videos. Without them, getting into the analysis of RNAseq-data would be a major chore. Thank you and stay healthy!",True
@MolYT,2020-02-10T14:11:30Z,0,"Hi, I have a doubt about this video.  It is clear that biological replications are necessary, but I think that the technical replications are also essential. Imagine that you have the number of counts of the gene NANOG of mice 1 and it is 30, and you believe that because you don't have nothing to compare. Nevertheless, if you use 3 technical replications, and two of them have 120 and 113, and the third one is 30, you can expect that that 30 is more probable to be wrong. I think it is also important because it measure you also the external factors and batch effect, things very important in RNA-seq.   Â¿What do you think about? Thank you for all the videos :)",True
@dbiezons,2019-10-30T20:20:55Z,0,What's an example of a biological replicate? What does that even mean?,True
@laurencemason964,2019-05-16T22:18:49Z,7,pretty sure this just saved my phd- triple bam!,True
@amnahah,2019-01-26T06:55:15Z,1,Please add explanatory video about stranded rna seq and their protocols in illumina because I could never understand the rna seq clustering and amplification step for that. Also about paired end reads using examples of sequences because its hard to understand the reverse complement and complement reads trhings.,True
@kalikiter1,2017-08-02T01:26:59Z,2,"I don't understand... Technical replicates should be nested in each biological replicate. Say you have technical replicated in triplicate or duplicate, the values should be fairly consistent between them, which is kind of the point of technical replicates, to control for stuff like pipetting error etc.. It seems dishonest NOT to do technical replicates, because who knows if what you're observing isn't just due to pipette error or undergraduate slave labor.",True
@maxfeng4532,2016-02-29T06:32:53Z,2,would you please make more videos? you are such a great educator and a master !! I highly recommend your video to my classmates in bioinformatics.,True
@maxfeng4532,2016-02-29T06:28:55Z,0,best video I have seen !! save me from struggle of seq data ! I am confused : should not the variation be the summed (difference)^2 ?  do we assume the variations ~normal distribution ?,True
@Tiago211287,2016-02-07T18:33:19Z,0,Your videos are the best Joshua.,True
@zerosiii,2016-01-19T15:51:40Z,1,"Hey man, your videos about different RNA-seq topics and problems are more than awesome, I (and probably others) really appreciate this. Keep up the good work with this and your other StatQuest videos!",True
