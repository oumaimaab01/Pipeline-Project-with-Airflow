The stiffness index of the lunar Achilles in each woman was obtained. The mean stiffness index for the ankle fracture group was 76.4 with a standard deviation of 5.83. In the control group, the mean was 82.3 with a standard deviation of 6.34. Assume that both samples are drawn from normal populations.  (i) Test at 5% level of significance, whether the variances of the stiffness  indices for the two groups are equal.  (ii) Using p-value approach, examine whether these data provide sufficient  evidence to conclude that, in general, the mean stiffness index is higher  in healthy postmenopausal women than in postmenopausal women  with ankle fractures? Take a=0.05  (iii) Obtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference of two population  mean stiffness indices. Does this interval confirm the conclusion derived  in part (ii).",True
