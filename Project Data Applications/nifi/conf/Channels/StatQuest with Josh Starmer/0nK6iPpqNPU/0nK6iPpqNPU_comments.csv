@27Merkaba,2020-12-27T07:42:33Z,1,"Hi Josh Starmer! I was curious if you would you be interested in making a video about a controversial statistics topic that has been going on right now? it involves a particular large youtuber that has been shown to have cheated his speedruns in minecraft. it was shown through overwhelming evidence in a paper published by the moderator team of minecraft that goes over the statistics.  you can find the original 29 page statistics paper in the video details of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MYw9LcLCb4  you can find the paper that dream commissioned from an astrophysicist who has an understanding of statistics who challenged the findings in the original paper (MST report) in the details of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iqpSrNVjYQ  there has been a lot of evidence to show that the response paper had fundamental flaws in the paper that can be found on r/statistics on reddit. the issue currently is there isn't any good video evidence showing why the response paper is wrong (or right if that's your finding). A lot of people now feel uncertain about the findings of either paper because the argument currently is that there isn't qualified individuals in the field of statistics to make a formulated opinion or lack the understanding to know if the first paper was correct or if the second was.   If you make a video, please do post your video to r/speedrun on reddit and I can guarantee your video will see a very large amount of views.  You could honestly make a whole series to dissect the many different statistical aspects which i have no doubt increase the amount of subscribers to your channel by a significant amount. A lot of people would like to understand the statistics behind this problem and we just don't have the expertise from someone like yourself to educate people on the topic.  if you need any more information on the topic please don't hesitate to ask for information on r/speedrun on reddit if you need to more information about how the drop rate chance in the game operates    Thank you for consideration !",True
