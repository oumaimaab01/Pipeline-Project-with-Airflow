@speedtent,2024-02-18T16:21:58Z,0,"thanks for a great video! i am trying to apply k-fold target encoding on my train and test data. i target encoded my train data using k-fold target encoding just like the video, but how should i encode my test data ? If the feature is BLUE, should i get the mean of BLUE (target encoded) in the train data and use it for test data? OR should i just use the whole train data to get new target encoding values for the test data?",True

@nitinsiwach1989,2023-11-11T08:00:16Z,0,Hi Josh. You rock. Can you help me understand how the k-fold target encoding results are used on the test data that appears months after the model is trained and is in deployment?,True
@lakshmanbharath,2023-09-17T12:16:15Z,1,"Hi Josh, a heartfull Thank you for sharing these encoding techniques  I have one doubt; it may look stupid, but I just want to clarify it with you. On 13:40, the encoding of green colour with target value 1 is 0.42, and below that, green colour with target value 1 is 0.67. So when encoding transforms the new data, will system change the green colour to 0.42 or 0.67?",True
@samore11,2023-09-07T07:46:33Z,0,"The methodology is very clear here. But one thing that bothers me is how a categorical feature can now have different numeric values - like Blue being .22 and .50. Let's say that all people who liked Blue also like Troll 2, and nobody else liked it. It seems that relationship would be easily recognized in a model if Blue was kept as is, or was given the same numeric value, but now it could be masked with the encoding techniques giving Blue different values. Am I missing something?",True
@michaelbohnen636,2023-09-06T12:09:03Z,0,"Hi Josh. How can you apply these methods in regression models? One Hot Encoding seems self-explainatory, but the weighted mean or the catboost methods seem, like they need additional steps...",True

@heteromodal,2023-06-17T11:12:52Z,0,"hey Josh and thank you as always for an amazing tutorial! :)  when we perform k-fold target encoding - it applies on all the data, and then you split to train-test sets? and then - we you have new data that you feed to the trained model and want to get predictions about - what would be the values you assign to the categorical features? the ones you'd get by just performing target encoding on all the initial data you had (train + test)?  thank you!",True

@Monkey_uho,2023-06-06T19:31:40Z,0,"Hey! I have a question regarding K-Fold target encoding. While I grasp the concept and the reason behind obtaining multiple values for the same category, I am uncertain about how to encode new data. Specifically, if I train a machine learning model using K-Fold target encoding and subsequently wish to test the model with new data, for which I do not have the target value, how should I go about encoding this data?  Should I take for instance the mean of all values corresponding to ""red"" ?",True

@tompease95,2023-04-01T11:56:40Z,1,"This is the first Statquest I've ever watched which I've actually found quite confusing - two things it leaves unanswered: a) It's quite a leap to go from encoding categorical features in a way that each category always has the same numerical representation (e.g. blue is always 1), to a way that doesn't, and there is no explanation of why that works. I'm thinking - ""How does the model know that 0.22 and 0.5 are referring to the same thing - isn't that an issue?"". b) With k-fold TE, how do you encode the test data?",True
@simoneparvizi775,2023-03-22T08:34:20Z,0,"If anybody can help me understand the ONLY thing that's not clear to me:  - In K-Fold target encoding, based on what do you choose the value of the weight? - Moreover, when I try it, I have results slightly above 1 (like 1.04,1.07, etc). It shouldn't be right? But I can't get why tho",True

Thank you people, stay smart and keep learning",True
@eoinwhelan4783,2023-03-15T00:54:48Z,0,"Great video! One question - in using kfold target encoding it seems like you're being counter productive in producing encodings that is useful to a model. For example a node of an XGBoost tree will look at 'colour' and split based on the value of the encodings, treating it as a continous variable. But what if by kfold encoding maybe 'Blue' has values between [0.3, 0.5] and 'Red' has values between [0.2, 0.5 ] - now you've disrupted the models ability to effectively split on this node! Appreciate any thoughts on this you might have",True

@khaikit1232,2023-02-13T10:19:07Z,0,"Hi  Thank you for the video but I just have some questions and hope I get clarifications from you: 1) Could you explain why you were concerned about data leakage when doing the k-fold target encoding?  The data leakage I know is when some test set information is incorporated into the model training. Is the dataset shown in the video supposed to be the full dataset or is it just the training/testing data for a machine learning model?   2) Target encoding feels very different from one-hot encoding and feels like we are replacing the original column with a derived column.  Hence I was wondering, what is the intuition and reason behind target encoding? In what situation would I use it over one-hot encoding?",True
