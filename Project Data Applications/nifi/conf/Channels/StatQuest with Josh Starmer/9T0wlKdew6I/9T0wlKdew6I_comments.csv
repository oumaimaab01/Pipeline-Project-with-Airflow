@bfod,2022-12-23T02:12:28Z,0,"Hi Josh, amazing videos. You are a godsend for visual learners and showing the concepts behind the math. I am a little confused about why we calculate the p-value for the R^2 the way we do.   We have:     Null Deviance ~ ChiSq(df = num params sat - null)    Residual Deviance ~ ChiSq(df = num params sat - prop) and we use these distributions to calculate the p-values for the null and residual deviance.  We also have:    LL R^2 = (LL_null - LL_prop) / (LL_null - LL_sat) but we calculate the p-value via:    null deviance - residual deviance ~ ChiSq(df = num param prop - null model)  Can it be shown that    (LL_null - LL_prop) / (LL_null - LL_sat) = null deviance - residual deviance and therefore     R^2 ~ ChiSq(df = num param prop - null model) or am I missing something?",True

@potatopancake5259,2022-01-20T16:03:04Z,0,"Hey Josh, thanks for this video on saturated models and deviances! I'm wondering whether I'm missing some point in your video or whether there may be some slight confusion. On the slide at 14:22 it says that the p-value computed on the slide before for the difference between NullDeviance and ResidualDeviance (NullDev - ResDev) gives a p-value for the R-squared (R2). I can follow the argument up to the point that NullDev - ResDev has a chi-square distribution, since it is in fact a classical likelihood ratio, namely the same as 2*(LL(Prop model) - LL(Null model)). However, if we want to express the R2 in terms of deviances, R2 would be (NullDev - ResDev)/NullDev, i.e. we divide by NullDev. The distribution of this is not chi-square anymore and we would get a different p-value. Would you be able to clarify this?",True
@mahadmohamed2748,2021-11-25T17:21:22Z,1,15:26 Why does multiplying the log likelihood's by 2 give a chi-sqaured distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters of the proposed model and the null model.,True

@Han-ve8uh,2020-10-17T09:28:10Z,0,"This video talks a lot about using chi-sq distribution, I have a general question about how distributions come about, because it seems people can design infinitely many different experiments to generate infinitely many distributions. Is chi-sq invented to measure p-value of R2 of logistic regression? If no, is it pure coincidence that this p-value can be seen from chi-sq, or the inventors of the 2(null dev-res dev) formula saw some useful properties of chi-sq and decided to use chi-sq, and invented the null dev - res dev formula? Is this formula tied to chi-sq only, or we can put the 21.34 value at 12:40 on the x axis of another dist that is not chi-sq too? Similarly, how/why was F distribution chosen to provide p-value of R2 for linear regression models?",True

I've always thought of R^2 as a measure of how much better our model is at predicting the value of dependent variable given the values of features, but adding a saturated model to the equation makes it less intuitive for me.  Of course, when we have the same amount of observations as dependent variables, we will maximize R^2, just because that's how math works (as they're in the same dimension you'll always be able to fit a geometric figure to all of them) but overfitting obviously is a malpractice.    I don't get why we measure our proposed model's predictive ability by kinda comparing it to a saturated one (which is pretty useless).",True

@margotalalicenciatura1376,2019-04-18T00:50:34Z,4,"Hey Josh! Again, thanks for your awesome work as always! In this specific case, I got into more questions than answers, but after trying to find answers on my own I assume it's a conscious decision to not overly complicate things.  Namely, you say that we ""-2"" in the log likelihood ratio is what makes it be chi-squared distributed. The origin of this seems to be the fairly complicate derivation in Wilks (1937), so I assume there is no quick intuitive way to answer why is this chi-squared distributed (i.e. in 13:42, which is the standard normal variable that's being squared?).  In the same line, about why are we working with the log of the likelihoods, is it because the saturated likelihood is obtained by maximization and thus it is easier to work with the logs? If that's the case, I'm not clear on what dictates which densities are used for the likelihood computation. As you say, you used normal distribution here for illustration purposes, but with regards to the actual computation of the likelihoods, what distributions are used by the glm function for example? In logistic regression I would first say that it's a binomial but that's only conditional on the x_is and would demand one parameter per observation.  And last but not least, the most simple question: why are Deviances and Likelihoods required in GLM in contrast to straight Sum of Squares and Residuals?  Again, thanks a lot for your time!",True
