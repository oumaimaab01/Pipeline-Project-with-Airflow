@Doctorpopets,2021-09-17T00:03:57Z,0,"So, are these regressions used for better trend visualization only, or there are any other reasons?",True
@navaneethansanthanam7970,2021-08-05T09:24:09Z,0,"Hi Josh, thanks for the video. Does LOWESS allow us to use set of external values to help with smoothing? Let's say I want to smooth some time-series data for one individual in a population. I'd like to do this while keeping in mind the overall population - so, when I smooth this individual, I'm doing it ""along with"" the population's mean time-series. Is something like this possible with LOWESS? Could I use the population's mean as a some kind of weight?",True
@RealMcDudu,2021-07-12T10:42:02Z,1,"Note that I think what you show is Robust LOESS (which also accounts for outliers, and gives the extra weight function for distance between y's and predicted y's). I think the LOWESS function in R  does it by default, but the LOESS function (it's successor) doesn't do it by default. You have to set family=""symmetric"" in the LOESS to get it. Specifically these two models do the same:   fit = loess(y~x, span=0.25, degree=1) fit2 = lowess(x, y, f=0.25, iter=0)  And so does these:  fit = loess(y~x, span=0.25, degree=1, family=""symmetric"") fit2 = lowess(x, y, f=0.25)",True

What about them vs. neural network? Essentially, all of them are function approximators. Thank you very much!",True

@cyrilbaudrillart9690,2020-09-10T16:47:30Z,0,"I am becoming a big StatQuest fan! Congrat for this great video. Just one question... According to what I understand the last points can be misleading because as we get more data, they will change. First we calculate last value of the curve, let's say corresponding to last point X(10), from points on the left, so X(5) to X(10). But as we get new points, let's say X(11), X(12), the value of the curve corresponding to X(10) will change because we now use points X(8) to X(12) in calculation. Am I correct? I hope this is clear... Thanks",True

@stefank4286,2020-05-08T11:48:13Z,1,"This was very helpful, but how do I get the actual regression function? Say I wanted to compute the approximated value for a x which is not a  data point?

@razzlfraz,2020-01-22T21:41:21Z,0,"Hey Josh great video!  Any idea why loess (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) and lowess (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing), are called a local regression ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression ) instead of a local autoregression?",True
