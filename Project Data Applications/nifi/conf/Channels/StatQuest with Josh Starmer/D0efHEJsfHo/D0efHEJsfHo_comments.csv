In the comments, you said that in order to find alpha, you need to do a complete search of them, adding 1 to the alpha value until it becomes large enough to make sense to prune, but this is a fundamentally incorrect statement.  Alphas from cost_complexity_pruning_path are found using weakest link pruning and this is done as follows: for all subtrees in the tree, alpha is calculated as the difference between the weighted impurity of the root node of the subtree and its total weighted impurity in the leaves. The node/subtree with the smallest alpha is deleted and falls into the cost_complexity_pruning_path array, and then this procedure is repeated from the bottom to the root node in the tree. After the selection of the best alpha from cost_complexit _pruning_path is carried out on a test set or using cross-validation.",True

Also for each training test set iteration will you get the same tree structures each time? Or do you have to use the training data for each iteration to get the base tree which could be different from the previous iteration's base tree structure. Even though the base trees and pruned tree outcomes may be different for each iteration as long as you use the same alpha values and the subsequent pruned tree has less RSS you can compile the RSS values for each alpha value no matter the tress structure and can still take the average RSS value for each alpha for comparison? For me, these steps weren't 100% clear or am I totally off base? Obviously the cross-validation iteration I guess is not clear to me. Thanks Rob",True

Not the initial full tree? And then cross validation will also be performed with the pre-pruned tree, not the initial full tree, to determine the final optimal alpha score?  And on a separate note, should only those alpha obtained from the tree trained on all the data be used when cross validating, and why? Is there no chance that some other, random alpha, might result in better performance? Considering that cross validation is done on several different test/train splits, and there will be those that do better with one alpha, and those that do better with other alphas, doesn't it make sense to try all possible alphas (from 0 to infinity) in the cross validation, not only those that give the best tree scores for the full tree?

@abdulsami5843,2022-08-06T01:18:14Z,0,the  average alpha value since is averaged across 10 folds won't be the exact same as any number of discrete values so in the end we will pick the discrete value that is closest to our averaged value right ? or is there like a distinct counter for each value and a score kept as to which one kept least SSR most times and on that note are these alpha values continuous or discrete across which we are making the pruned trees ?  apologies lots of question thrown there,True

@stedev2256,2022-07-19T11:35:42Z,0,"Hello, first of all thanks for the great material you produced and shared, certainly among the clearest and effective I've come across.  My questions are about the cross-validation trees to determine the right alpha values.  As a premise, if I understood correctly, we first determine candidate alpha values by : a) create a ""full"" tree from the full training+testing datasets b) produce the corresponding family of ""pruned"" versions (and I guess asses their SSRs in preparation for the next step) based on the morphology of the ""full"" tree (meaning, all possible pruned trees are considered - is that correct?) c) identify the candidate alpha values as those by which the ""full"" tree's score becomes higher than one of the pruned versions.  Assuming the above is correct, when we move on to cross-validate in order to ultimately determine the right alpha, I understand that we resample a training set (and a corresponding test set) for a number of times. Each time, we build a new tree from the training set, and its associated set of pruned versions (let me call these tress a ""cross-validation family of trees"" (CVFTs)), and assess their SSRs based on the test set for the current round in order to contribute to ultimately calculate the actual alpha to use.  First question: how come every CVFTs in your slides has a number of members that equals the number of candidate values for alpha? couldn't  a resampled training set might give rise to trees with more or even fewer leaves - and corresponding pruned versions - than the tree that was used to identify the candidate alpha values? And in that case,  the candidate alpha values might be in larger or smaller number than the possible number of trees in the CVFTs at hand. I imagine that a possible answer is that the number of members in a CVFTs can actually be different than the number of candidate alphas, and that the pruned tress in a CVFTs are actually identified through their Tree Scores when each of the alpha candidate values is applied -- and if so I guess the issue is that perhaps this mechanism does not stand out 100% from the presentation...   Second question: if we assess the trees in each CVFTs only by their SSRs, wouldn't always the tree with more leaves (therefore alpha=0) win?  Thanks much",True

Although I have one question: How do you build a decision tree using a particular value of alpha using the training data (during cross fold validation)??  How does alpha help?   I am working on classification decision tree, here's what I do: 1. Use all data to build full tree, get all subtrees and for every subtree get a value of alpha.

What role does alpha play here? I can grow a tree and then get subtrees without alpha - calculate test error (1-accuracy) for each subtree.  - select subtree, represented by alpha having the lowest test error.  3. selected alpha = avg alpha across all folds   4.

@karannchew2534,2021-06-28T05:54:37Z,1,"Hi Josh,  I don't get this part: 12:10 ""increase alpha until pruning leave give a lower tree score""  What does ""lower tree score mean""? Lower than the the score from the previous round?  The first (full) tree use alpha of zero. The second tree, pruned, will have a higher SSE, hence higher Tree Score. A non-zero alpha will only increase the Tree Score further.  So, how is it getting a ""lower tree score""?  Thanks, Kar Ann  ---  Notes for my own future reference:   *WHY PRUNING* To avoid over fitting, a less full tree is needed. Pruning procedure uses tree score that balance between classification error and number of leaves.    *OVERALL STEPS* 1. Create a set of Prune Trees.  Use Tree Score to decide how much to prune. The trees should have comparable ""quality"" in terms of error and number of node.   Tree Score = SSR + αT 2. Then, apply different subset of data (cross-validationally) to all Prune Trees.The Pruned Tree that give lowest SSR (with testing data set) is the winner.    *DETAILED STEPS*  Tree Score, TS = SSR + alpha* T   (T=no. of leaves)   TS is used to decide how much to prune, and to create different trees.  *1. Create a set of Prune Trees, which have comparable quality, in terms of error and number of leaves*  Create the 1st trial tree.  The fullest tree.  Tree1.   α1=0.  Get TS1.    Create the 2nd trial tree.  A new tree.  A pruned version of Tree1.  Tree2.  α2=a new value bigger than 0.     Compare the Tree Score between the old (full) and new trees (of smaller size i.e. pruned).      Even though the newer (pruned) tree has a bigger SSR, it has a lower T.      At α2 = 0, the newer tree has a higher TS than the old tree.      But the new tree TS increases slower than the old TS, because the old TS has a higher T.    Eventually, with a certain α2 value, the newer tree has a higher TS. Get TS2, using the new α2.  Create the 3rd tree.  A pruned version of Tree2.   Get TS3, using the new α3.  Repeat and create more prune trees.  Each with a α values.  Now, there are many set of tree. First tree is a fill tree.  Last tree is only one leaf. All tree comparable quality, based on fine balance between classification errors and number of leaves.   *2. Apply different set of data, cross-validationally, to all trees.  The Prune Tree that give lowest average SSR  is the winner*  .Create different values of alpha from the above eg. α1 - α5 .Use different set of training and test data i.e. 10 folds cross validation .From the 10 folds training and testing data, get SSR, with α1 - α4 .Get the SSR of each α, averaged over 10 sets of training and testing data .Pick the tree, and its associated α, that gives the lowest SSR   The fullest tree, though gives the lowest SSR with the training data, it doesn't give the lowest SSR with test data due to over fitting.  Cross validation also helps to minimise impact of over fitting.",True

My understanding is lower than tree score of the full sized tree at that specific alpha value, in this example, at alpha=10000, because we have already established the tree score of the full sized tree at alpha = 0 has the smallest tree score.

You said we obtain these values as soon as pruning leaves gives us a lower tree score. So the pruning is done first and then the alpha is increased till the tree score is lower than for the unpruned tree. Are we then using these discrete alpha values in the cross-validation procedure?

We use pruning to figure out the optimal number of leaves for the tree we build using the original training data. The purpose of the original validation/ testing data was to validate the performance of this tree, as we did not use that data in the creation of said tree. Now in the pruning process, the original testing/ validation data is used in conjunction with the original training data to determine alpha. This means, that the original validation data had a large impact on the tree we created from the orinal training data and is therefore no longer independant from it.

@user-xn7qt3zl4m,2020-01-08T05:14:13Z,2,The Best! The Best! The Best! video I've ever seen about Tree Pruning.  Thanks a lot. Now I got the concepts. BAMM!,True
@toja240,2020-01-07T20:17:01Z,0,"Hey, I have a question: if I have leaves in different branches on the same level, should I prune all leaves on this level or just in one branch I'm currently looking at?",True
@Bennilenny,2020-01-03T09:52:56Z,13,Your intros make me smile :),True
@dfragoulis,2020-01-02T18:56:34Z,1,"Potentially stupid question: Will we still need an additional (outside of the ""full data"") testing set to test the final (pruned) tree?",True
@Monia77777,2020-01-01T17:01:35Z,2,Friends reference - cherry on top! :),True
@Rectalium,2019-12-31T10:12:40Z,2,Your channel is amazing man. Great job,True
@monishaathikesavanpremalat7587,2019-12-17T13:20:06Z,0,Can you plz explain how to prune classification tree @Josh Starmer,True
@dhananjaysawai5087,2019-12-14T04:39:23Z,1,Best  Explanation  Dam !!!,True
@skumarr53,2019-12-11T12:59:21Z,1,"Just a random thought, what if we prune the tree directly based on ssr computed on validation set instead of adding penalty. Anyway the tree that works well on validation set is selected. Why are adding penalty?. Does it helps controlling fluctuations in the number of leafs selected across cross validation folds during Hypertuning .",True
@egorepishin1134,2019-12-04T20:00:12Z,0,But where is much anticipated xgboost???,True
@abhishekkaranath2119,2019-11-28T13:00:26Z,2,Subbed only for the intros,True
@aop2182,2019-11-27T04:37:02Z,11,This is awesome. I remember I was a bit confused when I was reading tree based methods in An Introduction to Statistical Learning. This really helps me understand it much easier when I can visualize it other than read some formulas.  Thank you!,True
@andyjiang8988,2019-11-26T20:45:36Z,192,The channel with the lowest Gini score of likes vs. dislikes,True
@rrrprogram4704,2019-11-26T17:48:22Z,1,we love you DOSS.. hope me too will surely one day be a patreon member,True
@mathematicalninja2756,2019-11-26T17:29:55Z,3,This channel is gold mine i am telling ya :D   can you cover box cox theorem (power transformations),True
@InsightsWithAkshay,2019-11-26T04:06:20Z,2,"In the video, you selected 4 values of alpha i.e. 0, 10k, 15k and 22k. How did you come up with exact alpha values? In the real-world, the dimensions of data will be huge so how to decide value alpha?",True
@mohamedhanifansari9224,2019-11-26T02:33:33Z,1,"Thank Josh, for your lucid explanation. We are longing for the XGBoost Videos. Any updates on that ?",True
@yulinliu850,2019-11-25T23:50:40Z,1,Thanks Josh!,True
@charlottel9534,2019-11-25T22:46:56Z,1,Thank you so much for posting this!,True
@jcatlantis,2019-11-25T20:10:49Z,0,"What about order of removing leaves? If we have a huge tree, do we need to generate all possible combinations of subtrees and alpha values?",True
@jcatlantis,2019-11-25T19:14:38Z,2,How new trees are build by imposing previous alpha values? Maybe it is not possible to find new continuously smaller trees of reduced Tree Scores for fixed alphas. Before alpha was a parameter and during cross validation is a constraint :(,True
@jerzysomkowski827,2019-11-25T17:09:25Z,1,I thought it would be  XGBoost video :(,True
