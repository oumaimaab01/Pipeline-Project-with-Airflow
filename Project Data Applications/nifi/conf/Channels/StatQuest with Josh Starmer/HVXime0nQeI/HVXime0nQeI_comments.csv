@hianjana,2019-06-13T10:28:00Z,5,"Your video is amazing as always... It would be great if you can include how to choose the value for 'k' and evaluation metrics for kNN. Also, if I understand it right, there is no actual ""training"" happening in kNN. It is about arranging the points on the cartesian plane and when a new data point comes, it will again be placed on the same plane and depending on the value of ""k"", it will be classified. Correct me if I'm wrong.",True
