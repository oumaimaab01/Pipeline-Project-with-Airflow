@statquest,2019-11-19T18:05:55Z,132,"NOTE: When I first made this video, I was thinking about how R-squared relates to Linear Regression, which will not fit a line worse than the mean of the y-axis values. This is because if the values along the x-axis are truly useless in terms of predicting y-axis values, then the slope of the line used to make predictions will be 0, and the intercept will equal the mean. However, it is possible to simply draw a line that fits the data worse than the mean and get a negative R^2.

@ghopuram,2024-05-13T13:58:28Z,0,"Hi Josh, quick question on the % interpretation of the r- squared. How can I interpret the percent in comparison to the whole, i.e. 100%? If I try n number of variables to explain y values and their individual r-squared sum up to 100% then can I interpret that these n variables together FULLY explain the variation in y? Why or why not?

Variation around the mean contributes higher percentage to the total variation in the data which is 81 % that has been reduced by considering variation around the mean.

@TheBjjninja,2019-08-26T12:01:52Z,0,Suggestion:  video would be much better if you use examples that people can relate to in their everyday lives.  The probability of someone that cares about mouse weights is just so small.,True
@SteveSolun,2019-08-24T15:55:38Z,1,Why squerring r correlation value will give me R^2? Please share some computation.,True
@sudhitiwaridwivedi3096,2019-08-20T15:51:09Z,2,Undoubtedly d best and to the point explanation. Thanks a lot,True
@sanketbadhe3572,2019-08-17T23:50:15Z,6,I read a lot on R square from different books and articles but this was the really different and very intuitive approach. Visualization is the best way to understand statistics and I think most books lack there.,True
@DK-rl1sf,2019-08-16T00:44:19Z,0,I was caught a bit off guard with this lesson on R Square. Was learning through the previous lessons in the basic play list sequentially and didn't come across R. Was there a lesson on R itself? And congrats on the Silver!,True
@TheKimhansu,2019-07-28T20:45:38Z,0,Would it be correct to say that the size/weight relationship accounts for 81% of the variation 'from the mean'?,True

@tanyoung_kim,2019-07-06T05:28:41Z,1,"It‚Äôs my first time to learn R and R^2. I‚Äôm not quite sure why R2 is easier and more intuitive than R. I understand the case of your example that R=0.7 and R=0.5. But what about when R=0.5 and R=0.25, R2s become not easier to compare. Should I see other videos first to understand this? Thanks a lot!",True
@shinhyelee3169,2019-06-19T08:40:35Z,4,Ah! this is the best video explaining R squared! Thank a lot!,True
@yasinzamani9467,2019-05-28T21:44:30Z,4,Thank you for this easy to understand video :-) I have two suggestion! - Time 0:50   -- instead of `strongly related` it is better to say `strongly linear related`!  We know that `R` can't explain nonlinear relationships (e.x. Y = X^2)!  - Time 10:00 -- instead of `0.7^2 = 0.5` it is better to say `0.7^2 \approx (is approximately equal to) 0.5` ;-),True
@beenasfarastodecidetouseve6733,2019-05-22T08:51:02Z,2,Mr StatQuest I love you,True
@LockyLawPhD,2019-05-02T08:32:10Z,0,Excellent video. Then how is f square different from R square?,True
@KARAB1NAS,2019-04-26T08:30:27Z,0,Nice explanation. To the point.,True
@tarun8122,2019-04-25T19:23:22Z,1,What if we get R = 0.75 .... We can't square it? Please answer,True
@akshaypatil3081,2019-04-03T07:40:14Z,0,Someone explain me the point at 7:17 where it says there is only 6% less variation around the line than the mean,True
@ramprakash7872,2019-03-21T18:53:45Z,12,"You have explained the concept so neatly,clearly ( most importantly in an easier manner ) so that one could get deeper understanding of the concept, a fact that lot many text books / videos / articles failed to do. Keep making such videos !",True
@robhuntington8504,2019-03-04T17:01:31Z,4,Why do most textbooks suck so bad at explaining statistics?? This was very helpful.,True
@xiaochengjin6478,2019-01-26T11:48:21Z,1,love your videos!,True
@ricardoagnelo2995,2018-12-20T18:51:44Z,5,Good explanation and your videos really are funny... good job,True
@emmanuelskywalker1581,2018-12-16T19:33:19Z,1,AWESOME! thanks for the explanation.,True
@AmosFolarin,2018-11-24T21:59:10Z,12,Beautiful explanation :),True
@benphua,2018-11-12T05:01:59Z,1,"The follow up on this video gives more examples on R^2 that really helped my understanding of the concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo, see around 8:03 of that video",True
@benphua,2018-11-12T04:42:03Z,2,"Another great vid, and for those who don't know there's a stat quiz  too which really helped me wrap my head more around the material, you can see which stat quests have quizzes at: https://statquest.org/video-index/",True
@DD-hh4tz,2018-10-12T15:54:07Z,7,"Your videos are so easy to understand, and also explains the intuition behind. I really love the way you start the video, unlike other bouring lectures.",True
@kowsergazi,2018-08-23T11:56:28Z,1,No one could make me understand R Squared in such easy way. Watched many videos. All made it complicated. Thanks.,True
@amiralessigue9075,2018-08-12T17:55:34Z,1,the best explanation as usual,True
@aamuz1cool,2018-07-18T12:14:58Z,9,"Adding to my previous comment , R2 value can be negative when the variance explained by the line is lesser than the variance explained by mean.  For example var(mean) = 30 and var(line) = 40  Then R2 = -0.3  There exists such models , perhaps that could be worst models.",True
@aamuz1cool,2018-07-18T12:09:53Z,2,Explanation of R squared was perfect and thanks for that. Plain old R is just a square root of R squared. I believe you don't mean pearson correlation coefficient(r) as plain old R.,True
@behroidinfo5819,2018-04-20T19:36:51Z,0,I'm sorry. I knew this concept that you tell in watching when inside the university. But our professor in econometric studies said he could get a negative number and this definition is not just everywhere.,True
@sanjaykrish8719,2017-12-30T06:24:46Z,8,Very beautifully explained. Many thanks to the folks of Genetics Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.,True
@vanya.antonov,2017-07-06T10:25:41Z,1,"Hello, great video as always! A quick remark -- am I understanding correctly that the ""plain old R"" means the ""Pearson correlation coefficient""?",True
@lilmoesk899,2017-06-25T13:46:18Z,0,"Super useful as always. Please continue with the videos (for example, prediction interval vs. confidence interval or maybe p-values vs. randomization tests or logistic regression...)! I liked your explanation because it never occurred to me that R^2 was basically the same as calculating percent change (diff/original)x100.",True
