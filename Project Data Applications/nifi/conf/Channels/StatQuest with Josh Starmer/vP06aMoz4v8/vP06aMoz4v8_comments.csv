What would be my positive class and negative class in that case? Question 2 - Can we have a video on precision and recall ? I find it very confusing so as which Precision and Recall should I be computing when working with imbalanced classification problems. Should I compute Precision and Recall for Majority Class (accepted transactions) or should I compute these metrics for Minority Class(rejected transactions).

@badoiuecristian,2020-05-19T15:41:35Z,0,I am a bit confused between the pairs (Sensitivity - Specificity)  and (Precision - Recall).

They help me understand the statistics and maths side of machine learning :) I have a question based on your example for the heart disease prediction; is it not possible to just use both models for predicting those 2 separate things? for example using the Random Forest for predicting heart disease and Logistic Regression for predicting free of heart disease?

@ChituOkoli,2020-02-04T06:55:30Z,0,"I just discovered your videos yesterday and I subscribed immediately. Thanks a lot! Could you please make a video on precision and recall? Actually, what I would really like to see, more than just the calculations, is help understanding when sensitivity vs. specificity is more useful than precision vs. recall and vice versa. I imagine that a purely calculations video on precision and recall would be very similar to this one on sensitivity and specificity, but knowing when each statistic is more useful in real life applications would be more helpful to me. You touched on that very briefly in this video when you mentioned which is preferred (random forest for higher sensitivity in detecting heart disease versus logisitic regression for higher specificity in confirming that people don't have heart disease), but it would be helpful if you spend more time on those--to me, it is that kind of application that really brings statistics to life.",True

@ivanpushin9362,2019-12-11T09:11:30Z,1,"Hi Josh, Thank you so much for a crystal clear visualisation of how Sensitivity and Specificity  are calculated. I wonder why in case of Troll 2 Sensitivity we calculate TN as the sum of 23, 77, 92, 17 instead of 23+17, because for me True (Negative) values seems to be the green ones since the predicted and actual values correspond to each other. But I see you include 77 and 99 which are marked as red/False to the True section. I tend to take your words as ground truth, but I don't understand where I'm wrong in calculating TN as the sum of 23 and 17. Could you explain it to me, please?",True
