@zchasez,2021-02-19T20:31:49Z,0,"Hi Josh, Can we also use Gaussian Naive Bayes for the spam/not-spam message example you did in the Naive Bayes video? For example, plot out a Gaussian distribution curve for each word's frequency ("" dear "" , "" friends"", etc...)",True
@redouaneabegar5490,2020-12-10T13:53:16Z,0,"Hello Josh. Thank you for the video!  I wanna ask you a question: Don't you think the probability of getting ""dear friend"" in a normal message should equal to: p(n)* [ p(dear/n)+p(friend/n)] The reason is : normally when we get dear, it is followed by friend so the independence rule of these two could be broken. Ain't it?",True

@pdkovacs,2020-08-09T12:26:09Z,1,"Regarding ""Bias and variance"", I find these cross references in your videos really useful. The most difficult thing (to me) with these ""small, very focused units with a limited scope"" methodology (which you explained in a recent video so well...and, frankly, I cannot even imagine how teaching could be done meaningfully in any other way over this parcticular medium [perhaps the study guides are meant to compensate for this]) is that the connection between the small units easily gets lost and the big picture easily missed. Thank you for these shameless self-promotions! :-) And thank you for all the excellent content you create!",True

@MohanSharma-gu8ow,2020-05-04T08:01:10Z,0,"Hello Josh!!! Thank you for those wonderful series of explanations on Machine Learning, your channel explains in a way that any naive person can understand them. Josh can you please share your thoughts through a wonderful video on different types of Regressors and Classifiers and when to use which by stating their differences in real world business problems. E.g. when to use Logistic vs SVM vs Naive Bayes vs KNN vs Decision Tree vs Random Forest?",True
@Kingstanding23,2020-05-03T22:22:26Z,0,"Wrangling your own data is definitely the hardest part of machine learning. You watch a few videos and can recreate them, but when it comes to feeding in your own data, you suddenly realise, you don‚Äôt actually know anything. You can‚Äôt shape your data correctly, nor do you know if your new favourite ML algorithm is even applicable. What is needed, is to see someone faced with a completely new/unseen problem and dataset, and watch them go through the thought process and explain their rationale for choosing specific algorithms, how they go about shaping their data, and how they solve problems they face. This could be done using Kaggle on a live stream.",True
