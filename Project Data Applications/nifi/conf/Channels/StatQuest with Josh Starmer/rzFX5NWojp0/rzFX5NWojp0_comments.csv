@szpwski4809,2020-12-13T14:17:30Z,0,"Hi Josh,  I have question about tests for normal distribution. Let's assume we have a data and we need to fit distribution to it. For that we do Shapiro-Wilk (SW), Kolmogorov-Smirnow (KS), Cramer-von-Mises (CvM) and Anderson-Darling (AD) tests. We take threshold as 0.05. Here are the results, p-value > 0.05 only for CvM tests, for the rest it is less than that. Should we try find another distribution? What if we did, and comparing ie. Weibull, Lognormal and Gamma distributions with Normal in Loglikelihood and AIC test we got the best values for Normal distribution. Is it the right moment to say that our data fits the normal distribution?   I asked this question in the comment section rather than sending you email because someone else may gain benefits from it. :)  Best wishes! :)",True
