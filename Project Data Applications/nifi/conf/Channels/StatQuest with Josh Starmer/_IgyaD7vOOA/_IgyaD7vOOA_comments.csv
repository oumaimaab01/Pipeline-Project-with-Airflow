@statquest,2021-07-21T12:01:48Z,74,"NOTE: Conditional probabilities can be written two ways: a ""long"" version and a ""short"" version. In this video I use the long version (because it's easier for me to read)... P(A and B | B) = P(A and B)/P(B) ...however, the short version is commonly used... P(A | B) = P(A and B)/P(B) Both mean the same thing, in other words: P(A and B | B) = P(A | B). The short version implies the ""and B"" part.

@tyt03538,2021-07-21T13:50:35Z,1,This is the best video explaining conditional probability. Hands down.,True
@statquest,2021-07-21T12:01:48Z,74,"NOTE: Conditional probabilities can be written two ways: a ""long"" version and a ""short"" version. In this video I use the long version (because it's easier for me to read)... P(A and B | B) = P(A and B)/P(B) ...however, the short version is commonly used... P(A | B) = P(A and B)/P(B) Both mean the same thing, in other words: P(A and B | B) = P(A | B). The short version implies the ""and B"" part.

@Oliver-cn5xx,2021-07-21T12:01:09Z,4,"Hi Josh, I am a long time fan of your channel and all of the shameless self-promotion has guilted me into buying one of your study guides (LDA). They seem great, a nice supplement to your videos. Though I think you would benefit greatly from stripping down the ordering process, I mean for online purchases almost noone asks for complete addresses, phone numbers and names anymore. I fought very hard with myself to finish it and parting with that information, and I succeeded simply because of being so grateful for the videos you provide. You'd probably sell a lot more of these if you just ask for an email. Like most. Cheers",True

@LukaszWiklendt,2021-07-21T06:59:15Z,3,It's interesting notation that you keep the superfluous condition on the left side of the pipe. I.e. using p(c=0 and s=1 | s=1) instead of p(c=0 | s=1). Do you find students understand it better this way?,True

@lakshman587,2021-07-21T04:22:42Z,2,If we take  Event A:Not loves candy Event B:Loves soda Then general formula is  P(A‚à©B|B)=P(A‚à©B)/P(B)  Is the above formula same as P(A|B)=P(A‚à©B)/P(B) (This is the formula I was taught),True
@EngRiadAlmadani,2021-07-21T04:10:47Z,2,BAMMM!!!! Great work Can you make video about bayesian classifier because it's depending on conditional probability,True
@pkmath12345,2021-07-21T04:02:22Z,56,Very nice video for sure. Conditional prob is one of the topics students feel the most difficulty when they start studying for stat! Great job!,True
