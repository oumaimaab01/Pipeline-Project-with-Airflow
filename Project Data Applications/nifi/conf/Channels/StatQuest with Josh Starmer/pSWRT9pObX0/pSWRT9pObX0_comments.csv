@deadlightsawesomepants7156,2021-02-20T23:33:48Z,1,(Timothy Oliphant + Macaulay Culkin )= stat quest guy.... I say this in all good fun  - Kudos to your videos - actually helped a lot!,True
@ricardofranco-duarte346,2020-07-07T16:16:05Z,1,"Hi Josh. One quick question, regarding ""your favorite machine learning algorithm"".  When you have a new dataset, you always test all/several machine learning algorithms and compare them in terms of performance, or you just go along with your favorite ones. Thanks in advance.",True
@Chocapic_13,2020-05-08T12:24:34Z,0,"Hey josh, I love your videos, but is there any reason why you prefer random forests over gradient boosting applied to decision trees? They're both very easy to analyse, but gradient boosting has better results for prediction, if not the best across all algorithms for structured data. For example the CatBoost library has a ton of built-in functions to analyze your data after fitting a model.",True

I have heard people say that it is the bible for Data Scientists.How important is it for a good Data Scientist to be thorough with all the concepts in the book?",True
@livingwithlinlin3122,2020-01-26T04:59:32Z,1,"Professor, Thank you so much for spending so much time making the video to share your knowledge with us. I was extremely moved after watching the answer for comment#3. The most recent video I watched from your channel is gradient descent step by step. In fact I only watched 50% of it and got stuck on ""derivative"". I learned calculus over 25 years ago, in Chinese, and never get to use calculus after that. I was so clueless about the word ""derivative"" and did not consider it as a term in math at the beginning. lol. After googling and relearning through Khan Academy, I finally start understanding it and made my daughter who learned AP Calculus AB watch your video and confirm on my understanding.  It feels good when stuff started connecting to each other. :-)  Hopefully I can catch your next live streaming.",True

@AmitKumar-si5ev,2020-01-24T05:46:00Z,1,You are such a wonderful person: Josh Starmer. It was a  wonderful Live Stream as well. Your videos are very helpful in understanding the real thing behind any algorithm. You take care of even the smallest thing. So much information is there in a single video. Sometimes I need to revise a video many times So that all the concepts remain in my mind. And Lots of such videos are there. I appreciate your hard and smart work. Please keep it up. Thank you a lot from deep down to my heart. One Indian Fan of Yours.,True

@vadimlazovskiy7442,2020-01-21T14:58:03Z,3,"Great stream, thank you.  I've been thinking about your Data Leakage example.  If in case of train-test we impute data after the split, how should we act if we doing cross-validation?  The only option i could think of is creating auto-impute function and calling  it on each fold.  Or it is not a good idea to use cross - validation with largely imputed datasets?  Than you!",True
