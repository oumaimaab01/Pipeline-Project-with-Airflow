@statquest,2020-01-15T12:45:58Z,511,"NOTE: Unfortunately I was a little sloppy with my terminology and that the word ""samples"" can mean different things, so let me try to rephrase it. If we collect 20 measurements and calculate the mean, and then do that a bunch of times (collect 20 measurements and calculate a mean), a histogram of those means will be a normal distribution. This suggests that an individual mean, calculated from 20 measurements, is, in and of itself, normally distributed. For example, if we had a uniform distribution and we collected 20 values from it and calculated the mean, then that mean would be normally distributed. We know this because if we repeated the process (collected another 20 values, calculated the mean, and then did that a bunch of times) the histogram of all the means we calculated would be a normal distribution.

If you make the experiment 10000 times, with sample size 20, the histogram in the end is the distribution of the sample with size 20, which does not have normal distribution.  When you take this 20 and increase it to infinity, thats when you have convergence to the normal.  For example: number of heads when tossing a fair coin. If you have sample size 2, the only possible values for the sample mean are 0 (2 tails), 1(two heads)and 0.5 (1 head and 1 tail).  The distribution of the sample mean X is   P(X=0)=0.25 P(X=1)=0.25 P(X=0.5)=0.5  This is not normal at all.",True

However, after I spent a few hours reading about the CLT in multiple books (such as the Princeton Companion to Mathematics, etc.), I slowly started to realise that the definition of the theorem itself doesn't really make a statement about ""taking multiple samples, calculating their average, then obtaining the distribution of the means which will be normal"" (I simplified here). In fact, I ended up on (in)famous Wikipedia because they also show the different versions of the CLT. Following what seems to be the most elementary or commonly accepted version of the CLT (paragraph 4 or the classical version in this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem#cite_note-2), the interpretation given in this video (as well as in my courses) is just a practical interpretation and application of the CLT rather than a direct statement from the theorem itself.

The thing which the Cauchy distribution teaches us instead is BEWARE OUTLIERS. A Cauchy would show up be giving us extraordinarily high or low values for our means in a sample. These of course would be created if we got a random sample all from the tails of the distribution that was Cauchy which has rather large tails which is why it does not have a mean.

It describes, for example, the distribution of light frequencies that are emitted by an element in spectroscopy; or the distributions of energy/mass of daughter particles in a nuclear/particle decay.  Probably less important in Biostatistics, I imagine.  I should mention that a Cauchy distribution DOES have a mean, but it does not have a VARIANCE (it's infinite) so physicists use the ""Full-Width-Half-Max"" as a useful variable.

Well and good, but I personally have found that if you can write a program which SIMULATES what you want to investigate, that's an even better pedagogic tool. As a subroutine in my work on other simulations I found it necessary to have a means of generating normally distributed numbers.  If we use ' n ' pseudo-random numbers having equal probability in a chosen range, drawing them from a built in generator [ available in most higher programming languages ] and ADD these numbers these packets can be used as input for a normal distribution. Depending on the choice of ' n ' we can generate a platykurtic distribution or its opposite a leptokurtic one.  In the physical world we could do the same thing by dropping spheres which fall through a regular lattice of bars, noting how far off the centre each trial ends. As an interesting aside doing the same thing with the pseudo-random generator's output, except this time. MULTIPLYING the separate n numbers, will yield packets which are skewed and simulate a ' log normal ' distribution.

I do want to point out that the Central Limit Theorem is why statisticians celebrate the Normal Distribution at all, because let's be honest, the normal density function is supremely ugly to look at and near impossible to fuss with. The CLT is one of those ""too good to be true"" laws of the universe, and it is actually more miraculous than this video presents itself.   The most generalized form claims that the sum (not just the mean, which is just the sum divided by a constant) of any random variables will be roughly normally distributed. These random variables don't even need to come from the same distribution. You can sample from a uniform, a beta, a lognormal, an inverse gaussian, and the sum of those 4 values will be normally distributed. (fine print, the variances and means need to be in comparable range otherwise one sample will dominate).   It's also the reason why waiting time starts to become normally distributed, because it is the sum of exponential (which is a gamma distribution, which converges to normal very fast). It is also the reason why most variables in life are normally distributed, because you can usually break them down into sums of smaller categories of unknown distributions.",True

@statquest,2020-01-15T12:45:58Z,511,"NOTE: Unfortunately I was a little sloppy with my terminology and that the word ""samples"" can mean different things, so let me try to rephrase it. If we collect 20 measurements and calculate the mean, and then do that a bunch of times (collect 20 measurements and calculate a mean), a histogram of those means will be a normal distribution. This suggests that an individual mean, calculated from 20 measurements, is, in and of itself, normally distributed. For example, if we had a uniform distribution and we collected 20 values from it and calculated the mean, then that mean would be normally distributed. We know this because if we repeated the process (collected another 20 values, calculated the mean, and then did that a bunch of times) the histogram of all the means we calculated would be a normal distribution.

The CLT does rely on having a finite *population mean*, but that's not the important part of the fine print anyways! The part about the sample size is far more important.

@cantkeepitin,2019-01-30T21:44:32Z,0,"I think from strict math view point there are several clear mistakes in the video. There are e.g. many distributions having no mean! E.g. all alpha-stable distributions with alpha<2. And even for a Cauchy distribution, each sample data from the Cauchy will have a mean. It will just not converge as usual, as in  most other cases with the typical SqrtN law. The trap is like this: if we sum up e.g. 1/i for i=1 to any number N, it will be finite, but it will not converge in the limit N approaching infinity. For CLT it is also the other way round, i.e. the approx. is usually only perfect if we would average infinite times.",True

The labels on Y axis are throwing me off.  For example,  on the uniform distribution how can all values have a probability of 1.0?  My first thought was ""1 means 100% probability of that value occurring""  But they can't all have a 100% probability of occurring.

With a view of calculating the mean(mu) of this, calculate the sample mean that is Yn(bar). Now as n-->infinity,                              (Yn(bar) - Mu) / (sigma/root of n)  approaches a normal distribution.

@abalter,2018-11-16T03:54:48Z,26,"Josh--you are an inspiring teacher. Tidbit about distributions that don't follow the CLT. I believe the condition for the CLT to hold is that at least the first and second moments of the distribution are finite. There are many phenomena in nature that are, more or less, modeled by power law distributions (Pareto, Zipf, etc.) or ones with power law tails (Levy). Any distribution with a tail that decays slower than x^(-3) (i.e. x^-a where a<3) will have an infinite variance. If a<2, then the mean is infinite as well. These distributions can't truly model anything physical, but sometimes apply for a meaningful range of values. Therefore one would want to apply the CLT carefully for these cases.",True
