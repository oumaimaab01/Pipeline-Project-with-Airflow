@RonaldCutler,2024-04-25T19:03:39Z,0,"Now you should make a video of why you can’t use these to compare genes between samples and only to compare genes to each other within a sample.

@ivantsers9445,2019-03-10T10:55:35Z,37,"thank you very much for explanation! But one thing I should notice: the ORDER of division (i.e. order of steps) doesn't matter. It matters, by WHAT are you dividing for  - in TPM it's not just library size (i.e. raw amount of all reads), but all counts of reads, normalized by length (i.e. summary RPK across all genes). This is the root of differences between RPKM and TPM",True
@MrDeking10,2019-03-06T08:54:00Z,0,"What are some typical TPM values? I got a lot of zeros in my dataset. However there is a lot of values between 1 and 2, and some as high as 13. Thanks",True
@TheBloodyBeat,2018-11-27T11:38:13Z,1,"Thanks for the awesome video ! If I understood well, none of these metrics takes into account the amount of unmapped reads. So does comparing TPM across samples that aren't replicates (e.g. a few environmental metagenomes) make any sense ?",True

@fmetaller,2018-09-18T15:39:31Z,1,First I want to thank you for this great explanation. There is a point I'm missing. All these normalization techniques assume that each type of cell analyzed is producing the same amount of RNA and all the difference we see are due to some variability in the depth of the sequencing. But is this true? Shouldn't be a better idea to normalize the count only on some housekeeping genes like we do with qPCR?,True

@johnswenson6699,2017-04-26T22:17:47Z,0,"Hey Joshua,  Thanks so much for this video. I've a follow-up question: suppose I want to compare relative expression levels of gene A between two samples, but the tissue samples vary in size ... do these normalization methods take into account the fact that some samples will have more genes present than others?   As a hypothetical (but easy to visualize) example, suppose I cut off a hand, ground it up, and sequenced the RNA. This is sample 1. For sample 2, I cut off a different hand AND the attached arm, ground them all up, and sequenced the RNA. If I expected gene A expression only in the fingertips, would I be able to compare the two samples to uncover which sample had more expression of gene A, even though sample 2 had more (and more diverse) input tissue than sample 1?   In short, is a there a normalization method that accounts for the fact that there may simply be a greater variety of genes being expressed in one sample relative to another?  Thanks again for this video. You explained these concepts better than any other source I've found!",True
