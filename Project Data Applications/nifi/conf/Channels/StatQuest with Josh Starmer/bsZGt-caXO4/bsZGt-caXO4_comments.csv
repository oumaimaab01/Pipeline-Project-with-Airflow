@nathannguyen2041,2024-02-03T04:24:52Z,0,"Hi Josh. Why not report both?  Also another question. Are you saying that it is only considered p-hacking if I decide to perform a one-tailed test after receiving the data and then taking a look at it. Suppose I planned on a one-tailed test before collecting data. That wouldn't be considered p-hacking?   Suppose they're both the same dataset.. one person planned on a one-tailed test before looking at the data while someone decided to do a post-hoc one tailed test after doing some exploratory data analysis. Is one p-hacking while the other isn't?  Looking forward to an answer, and thanks for all your work.",True
@karthica5251,2024-01-16T02:29:56Z,0,"Wonderful as always, one question though: In the starting example, when we perform a t-test, in order to determine the p-value we would calculate the f-value then randomly generate data (I assume within the max and min values) repeatedly and determine the f-values and plot them in histogram to get the f-distribution and use the original f-value to determine the p-value. In this context, what does it mean to have a 1-sided vs 2-sided test? Confused due to the shape of the f-distribution. Thanks : )",True

@pushkarwagh9974,2023-04-29T20:09:46Z,0,does a two tailed t-test tell mean of distribution A is greater than mean of distribution B? or it just tells me that they are different?,True
@meeravinod2027,2021-11-12T20:28:29Z,0,"Hello Josh, can you mention an example of a test where it only makes sense to do a 1 tailed test?",True
@flowereye3720,2021-10-22T16:52:33Z,1,Thank you very much Josh,True
@mangning1107,2021-10-10T13:24:37Z,1,hope this statistics series will be more complete and systematic,True
@hq9248,2021-07-11T20:41:10Z,0,"Hi, Josh. Thanks for the great video! One minor problem at 3:45, it's a probability density function, so y-axis doesn't mean the probability..",True
@hepcat93,2021-05-16T08:24:27Z,0,"Could someone explain me, why we have more or less equal amount of tests in each p-value ""basket"" (4:50 in the video)? Since p-value is related to the probability itself, shouldn't we have more tests with bigger p-values? Sorry for (probably) a silly question.",True
@dengzhonghan5125,2021-02-20T03:51:09Z,0,"Hello Josh, do we have some videos for statistical tests or t-test?",True
@jiayiwu4101,2021-01-16T22:01:26Z,0,I am confused.....So why the two tests have contradict results?,True
@yogeshbharadwaj6200,2020-10-12T03:08:07Z,0,"Tks for the video sir, So the learning from this video is, when we do 1 tailed test the chances of reporting 'false positive' is more than 2 tailed test,  Hence it's always recommended to go with 2 tailed test whenever possible. Correct understanding ?Also in this video we didn't conclude whether new treatment is better than standard one, it was just an example to start with, correct ? just got confused whether conclusion was drawn or not.....pls help to clarify...Tks in advance.",True
@alifahsanilsatria2532,2020-09-09T08:42:33Z,0,"Hi Josh. Thank you for your amazing explanations.  I have one question. Let say I want to know whether treatment A is better than treatment B. First, I test it using two-tailed test with null hypothesis ""treatment A is not significantly different than treatment B"" and then (let say) from the result I reject the null hypothesis. Second, because i reject the null hypothesis from the first result, the possibilities are either ""treatment A is better than treatment B"" or ""treatment B is better than treatment A"". I test it again using one-tailed test with null hypothesis ""treatment A is no worse than treatment B"" and then (let say) from the result I failed to reject the null hypothesis. So, based on these two results, I conclude that ""treatment A is better than treatment B""  is that the right way? if not, what is the better way to know whether treatment A is better than treatment B?  Thank you",True

@benitshetty8492,2020-04-07T06:29:25Z,0,please provide videos on the hypothesis testing with examples!,True
@rubenpinnata4626,2020-03-31T09:10:54Z,0,"what I'm understanding is that when you use 1-tailed, the Zscore must be above 1.64 while if you use 2-tail, the Zscore must be above 1.96 and in this sense, two tailed is more skeptic to h1 so its good. but how can the same data result in 2 p values while the X, mean, sd and n have the same values?",True
@Patrick881199,2020-03-17T00:32:15Z,1,"The one tailed p-value test here tests the null hypothesis that the new measurement is better, and we get a p value of 0.03 which is smaller than 0.05, that means the null hypothesis is likely to be wrong. Am I understanding it right?  P is low, null must go! Right?",True
@snakewayne9112,2020-01-10T15:42:04Z,2,After watching the P value vedio I watched this one.I can't find vedios introducing t test on your list . Am I missing something?,True
@TheEbbemonster,2019-08-05T12:35:40Z,0,"If your hypothesis beforehand is that your medicine will improve the condition, and you state beforehand that you are going to use a one-sided t-test, I do not see the problem.",True
@changyongli1332,2019-06-23T00:37:03Z,4,good to know about the p hacking,True
@dmitryoshkalo789,2018-07-26T14:34:20Z,3,Thanks for the video! I can't get the point of the experiment with a normal distribution. Why do you call non-overlapping samples a false-positive and why it has a probability of 5%?,True

@fmetaller,2018-07-07T07:36:53Z,3,Could you tell me an experiment in witch it's correct to chose 1 tailed t test a priori?,True
