@arthurw1099,2020-04-08T19:00:57Z,0,"Amazing video! I can see how much efforts you committed to this series. I just have one naive question: when we estimate each conditional probability for ""Dear"" from the training set, shall we count the frequency of ""Dear"" words among all words in spam or ham message? Or just look at each message, count 1 if it contains ""Dear"" (no matter how many ""Dears"" in it), and then summarize the frequency for either class? I feel that it matters when we calculate the posterior. The former might be more accurate for predicting a group of messages but may not be good for a single message. Thx!!",True
