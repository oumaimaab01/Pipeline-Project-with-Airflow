I have a question about the intuition behind all this:  Intutively it really doesnt make sense to me, why we need to include the error of the virginica and versicolor, when we are trying to optimize a value that only affects setosa? Would a correct intuition be: It is because they ""indirectly"" indicate how well the Setosa predictions are? In other words, because of Soft Plus, we will always get a probability of Setosa no matter what input we use?

@pedrojulianmirsky1153,2022-05-02T23:48:13Z,1,"Thank you for all your videos, you are the best! I have one question though. Lets suppose you have the worst possible fit for your model, where it predicts pSetosa = 0 for instances labeled Setosa, and pSetosa = 1 for those labeled either Virginica or Versicolor.  Then, for each Setosa labeled instance,  you would get dCESetosa/db3 = pSetosa - 1 = -1, and for each nonSetosa labeled instance dCEVersiOrVirg/db3 = pSetosa = +1. In summary, the total dCE/db3 would be accumulating either +1 for each Setosa instance and -1 for each non Setosa. So, if you have for example a dataset with 5 Setosa, 2 Versicolor and 3 Virginca:  dCE(total)/db3  = (1+1+1+1+1) + (-1 -1) +(-1 -1 -1) = 5-2-3 = 0. The total dCE/db3 would be 0, as if the model had the best fit for b3. Because of this compensation between the opposite signs (+) and (-), the weight (b3) wouldn´t be adjusted by gradient descent, even though the model classifies badly. Or maybe I missunderstood something haha. Anyways, I got into ML and DL mainly because of your videos, can't thank you enough!!!!!!!",True

@ferdinandwehle2165,2022-03-11T10:02:47Z,0,"Hello Josh, your videos inspired me so much that I am trying to replicate the classification of the iris dataset. For my understanding, are the following statements true:  1) The weights between the blue/orange nodes and the three categorization outputs are calculated in the same fashion as the biases (B3, B4, B5) in the video, as there is only one chain rule “path”.  2) For weights and biases before the nodes there are multiple chain rule differentiation “paths” to the output: e.g. W1 can be linked to the output Setosa via the blue node, but could also be linked to the output Versicolour via the orange node; the path is irrelevant as long as the correct derivatives are used (especially concerning the SoftMax function). 3) Hence, this chain rule path is correct given a Setosa input: dCEsetosa/dW1 = (dCEsetosa/d”Psetosa”) x (d”Psetosa”/dRAWsetosa) x (dRAWsetosa/dY1) x (dY1/dX1) x (dX1/dW1) Thank you very much for your assistance and the more than helpful video.

@harshchoudhary2817,2022-02-13T10:15:50Z,0,What I see from here is that the gradient descent optimizes on the basis of total cross entropy and tries to minimize it Suppose for some data the actual o/p is setosa but the neural net predicts versicolor with a very high probability say close to 1 so the loss would still be minimized and the gradient desent won't optimize it. So we will get a wrong o/p with very high probability. Is it so or am i missing something here?,True
@andredahlinger6943,2022-01-30T22:07:24Z,1,"Hey Josh, awesome videos <3 What I don't get here is why we optimize for the predicted ""probabilities"". My understanding of the predicted probabilities was that they are mainly a transformation of the raw output values because the predicted probabilities are more handy to interpret. But if it's ""just"" a transformation of the raw output, why would we optimize it's ""prediction"" error (1-predicted ""probability"") after we applied this principle already in the back propagation process to get the raw values, where we also optimized the ""prediction"" error (i.e. the SSR)? This seems like optimizing after we already optimized. Is this necessary, cause we have to adjust the weights and biases to the new output ""scale""?",True

@tulikashrivastava2905,2021-03-31T13:01:47Z,0,Thanks for posting the NN video series. It was just in time when I needed it 😊 You have the knack to split complex topics into logical parts explain them like a breeze😀😀 Can I request you to share some videos on Gradient Descent Optimisation and Regularization ?,True
@erniec.2088,2021-03-15T09:24:07Z,1,Bam!,True
@iZapz98,2021-03-13T16:07:30Z,13,"all your videos have helped me tremendously studying for my ML - exam, thank you",True
@RubenMartinezCuella,2021-03-09T09:16:21Z,24,"Even though there are many other youtube channels that also explain NN, your videos are unique in the sense that you break down every single process into small operations easy to understand by anyone. Keep up the great work Josh, everyone here appreciates so much your effort!! :D",True
@dr.osamahabdullah1390,2021-03-08T00:49:41Z,0,Is there any chance to talk about deep leaning or compressive sensing plz; your videos are so awesome,True
@bigbangdata,2021-03-07T16:49:12Z,105,"Your talent for explaining these difficult concepts and organizing the topics in didactic, bite-sized, and visually compelling videos is astounding. Your channel is a great resource for beginners and advanced practitioners who need a refresher on a particular concept. Thank you for all that you do!",True
@osamahabdullah3715,2021-03-07T11:37:39Z,1,"I really can't give enough from your videos, what an amazing way of explanation , thanks for sharing your knowlege with us, when is gonna be your next videos plz ?",True
@pietrucc1,2021-03-05T11:01:30Z,1,"I started using the techniques of the machine learning from a little less than a month, I found this site and it helped me a lot, thank you very much !!",True
@rhn122,2021-03-05T03:08:48Z,0,"Hey cool video, though I actually haven't fully watched your neural network playlists, just want to keep things simple with traditional statistics for now hehe! But I want to ask you about all these steps and formulas, do you actually always have in mind all of these methods and calculations, or only keep the essential parts and their ups & downs when actually solving practical problems?  Because I love statistics, but can never fully commit myself to be in one with the calculation steps. I watched your videos to understand the under the hood process, but only keep the essential parts like why it works and its pitfalls, and leaving behind all the calculation tricks.",True
@l.prasathpresss8288,2021-03-04T14:51:44Z,0,Bro I had no idea how to code this softmax backpropagation . Please put video bro 🙏,True
@environmentalchemist1812,2021-03-04T03:10:27Z,0,"Some topic suggestions: Could you go over the distinction between PCA and Factor Analysis, and describe the different factor rotations (orthogonal vs oblique, varimax, quartimax, equimax, oblimin, etc)?",True
@charliemcgowan598,2021-03-04T01:54:47Z,2,"Thank you so much for all your videos, they're actually amazing!",True
@justinwhite2725,2021-03-03T16:50:39Z,0,I think I need a derivatives 101.  I've followed every gradient descent/neural net video and you jumped straight to derivitaves like we already knew what they were. It's a huge 'black box' to me and when I try to do exactly what you say I can't get a handle on it because my exact scenario is different and I don't know how to figure out the derivatives (or even what a derivitive actually is),True
@lokeshbansal2726,2021-03-03T10:26:32Z,0,Thank you so much! You are making some amazing content. Can you please suggest some good book for Neural Networks in which mathematics of algorithms is explained or can you please tell from where you are learning about machine learning and neural networks. Again thankyou for these precious videos.,True
@nonalcoho,2021-03-03T09:02:33Z,1,"It is really easy to understand even I am not good at calculus.  And I got the answer that I asked you what's the meaning of the derivative of softmax in the last video. I am really so happy! Btw, will you make more programming lessons like you made before~? Thank you very much!",True
@shubhamtalks9718,2021-03-02T02:22:10Z,1,BAM! Clearly explained.,True
@MADaniel717,2021-03-02T01:30:10Z,1,"If I want to find biases of other nodes, I just do the derivative with respect to them? What about the weights? Just became a member, you convinced me with these videos lol, congrats and thanks",True
@Anujkumar-my1wi,2021-03-01T17:44:29Z,0,Can you tell me why we don't use polynomials as activation function?,True
@Meditator80,2021-03-01T08:30:40Z,1,Thank you so much! It is so clear for explaining the calculation of Cross Entropy Derivative and how to use it in BP,True
@yuewang3962,2021-03-01T07:10:52Z,2,Caught a fresh one,True
@mrglootie101,2021-03-01T06:35:22Z,1,Finally 🎉,True
@shreeshdhavle25,2021-03-01T05:16:41Z,1,Finally was waiting for new video so long...,True
@JainmiahSk,2021-03-01T05:15:29Z,1,Love ❤️❤️❤️ it,True
