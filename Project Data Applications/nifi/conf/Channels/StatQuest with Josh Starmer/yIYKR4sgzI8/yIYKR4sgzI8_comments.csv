@wahco80,2023-10-10T18:12:50Z,0,"üéØ Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  Logistic regression predicts whether something is true or false, not continuous values like linear regression. It uses an S-shaped logistic function to determine the probability of an event (e.g., mouse obesity) based on input variables (e.g., weight). Logistic regression is commonly used for classification tasks where a probability threshold (e.g., 50%) is used to classify samples. It can work with both continuous data (e.g., weight and age) and discrete data (e.g., genotype and astrological sign). Unlike linear regression, logistic regression uses maximum likelihood instead of least squares to fit the line to the data. Variables' significance in logistic regression is determined by testing if their effect on the prediction is significantly different from zero using Wald's tests.  Made with HARPA AI",True

@billb3324,2022-01-27T13:55:23Z,0,"Thanks for these awesome videos Josh! I'm watching through many of them today. This one is really good, though I think you made a mistake when you chose ""obesity"" as your categorical variable. It's confusing because it is not really a categorical variable, it's a somewhat arbitrary split of the continuous data (weight). Then you are using weight as a predictor variable in your model, which adds to the confusion. Maybe a traditional ""having X disease or not"" would be a better categorical variable.   I also think that you should connect the dots more for students in terms of why we are running this model - the inferential part of inferential statistics. We don't really care that much about these particular mice, they are the ones that help us create the model. The model is for understanding a new mouse that was not in the model - we may not be able to directly measure if it has the disease or not, but we can make an educated guess about that by taking some measurements of things that we can easily observe, the predictors in your model.   Again these are very well done videos, love them!",True

@jeffnador9594,2021-04-26T18:54:30Z,1,"Worth saying that you can compare models in logistic regression, just not with the same approach as linear regression. One simple way, for instance is using the Akaike Information Criterion (or AIC); it's calculated by taking the natural log of the likelihood function, and subtracting it from the number of predictors in the model, then doubling that difference: 2[k - ln(likelihood function)]. Once you've calculated it for each model, the one with the *lowest* AIC is the most parsimonious. That is, it does the best job of fitting the data with the fewest predictors.  You can do something similar to get Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and if you take the quotient of two BICs, you've got a Bayes factor that you can use to compare the evidence for or against either model.",True

I already bought one of your t-shirts to express my thanks to your nice videos related to machine learning. However I have a question to the part ""fitting a line"". Instead of using maximum likelihood as one approach to optimize the parameters that fit the line, isn't it possible to use the cost function which might be the negative logarithm in that case? Also could you provide a video that visualizes the decision boundary not as a straight line, like a more advanced version of logistic regression explanation? Best regards!",True

@vijayendrasdm,2018-08-20T09:50:01Z,0,"Hi Josh  I have a small confusion,  From 3.3 minutes on wards you say that,  the y axis is probability between 0 to 1, but on x axis you consider just the feature  i.e weight_of_mouse. I am confused here, I expected the x-axis must be  z not just weight_of_mouse. where z =  w1*weight_of_mouse+ b     or              z =  w1*weight_of_mouse ,         if we ignore b.   Because, if you are interpreting the outcome as probability, then you are taking the sigmoid of z.  And z = w1*x1+w2+x2+......  Correct me if I am missing anything here.
