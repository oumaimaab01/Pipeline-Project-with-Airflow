@raygivler,2019-12-15T16:26:34Z,4,"There is research data to back up Josh's preferences. My rule of thumb is that I basically only use pie charts for a binary dimension (ie, it can only have 2 possible values like Passed/Failed, Living/Dead) and include a measure of % of whole. I use the same guidelines for donut charts, which are worse that pie charts because they exclude the central angle of the pie, which is your primary means of visual measure, and people are terrible at that anyway. I also like donuts to wind around clockwise (for whatever the positive value is) because people have a lot of experience watching a clock and can interpret the % of rotation pretty easily.",True
