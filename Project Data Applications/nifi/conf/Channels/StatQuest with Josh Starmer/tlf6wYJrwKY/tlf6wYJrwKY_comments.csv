@linuxgirl_,2024-04-15T05:30:31Z,1,"Well, the plus sign is just there to separate the sequence from the Phred scores. You have to have some defined character to separate them so you can programmatically convert from FASTQ to FASTA (you have to write a script or a fancy program to find the plus sign and everything that comes after it on the next line and delete it). A plus is fitting, since the sequence and the quality scores are concatenated to each other. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",True

@reflections86,2023-03-24T06:55:21Z,1,"Hey JOSH‚Ä¶First thanks for making such great videos over the years. I see that you even left your job as a professor and have devoted full time to make this stuff since 2017. Appreciate it as it is difficult to break your comfort zone.   One thing I would say after reading books on mastery is that all elite masters have this skill to explain a tough concept in 2 minutes and they can drag the same concept for hours and hours. From thousands of comments on your videos, majority says you make things extremely simple which is a validation of mastery. The second aspect of elite masters are after working for about a decade and mastering a field then they bring innovation or a new thing (a new concept, theory, a formula, anything that was never explained). I‚Äôm sure this would be that phase and stat quest is part of that, and I hope many things would come along with your creativity which you have exploited to make this elite content.   There are masters but very few have this skill to make things simpler. Many people might comment that you have mastery or talent in statistics or in music but I can say without any doubt that your talent lies is making complex things easier (the medium could either be through a video or through a book don‚Äôt matter), but that‚Äôs your core talent which you have used. So I wish you keep using this rare talent and bring more contribution to all the humans.  I will certainly support statquest by purchasing the guides and encourage all who have benefited from this content. Thanks again and lastly is there any email if I could send you a message or share something of value. Will appreciate it.",True

I just have some questions about how the sequence being broken up into fragments bit and wonder how the reads are counted. If they break the sequence into small fragments, is there a chance that these fragments might match fragments of more than one ""reference"" sequence? Also, is there a chance that fragments of one sequenced read actually match a ""reference"" sequence but because the ""reference"" sequence was broken up in a different way so they ended up not matching each other?  for example, the ‚Äúreference‚Äù (ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG) is broken up to fragments (ATCGATCGAT and CGATCGATCG) and the fragment of the read is from the same sequence but is just broken into a sequence ‚ÄúTCGATCGATC‚Äù? I am also wondering, how do they count the number of reads? If they break them into fragments, this means that these fragments actually all originate from the same ‚Äúreference‚Äù sequence, so how do they know which fragments were from the same sequence and only count once?",True

I meant, if I have the RNA read ‚ÄúA‚Äù isolated, then ‚ÄúA‚Äù is converted to cDNA in which the adapters are linked ( RNA read ‚ÄúA‚Äù is degraded, I suppose! ), then into the PCR amplification process ‚ÄúB‚Äù is generated as the complement for ‚ÄúA‚Äù cDNA.

@gabrielerosso9612,2018-04-13T13:33:14Z,0,"Hello congratulations for the video. Very clear and well explained. Thank you! I'd like to have some clarifications: 1) minute 9:14 when you say ""the genome fragments that matched the reads fragments will determine a location (chromosome and position) in the genome"" basically means that for reads aligned/mapped we know their position with respect to the reference genome, or are you referring to something else? 2) minute 9:29 - I don't understand why breaking read sequences into small fragments. In the example (9:45) you say that the first fragment will not match beacuse of the A mismatch, but also with some mismatches reads can map on the reference genome. So why make fragments is a better choice. Moreover fragments too small improve multimapping, not good for gene expression profiling. Could you clarify my misunderstanding? 3) Finally i ask you with what program have you created these images.  Thanks!",True

For example, if one sample is brain and the other is muscle,  can we still use edgeR or DeSeq2? My friend found ~7000 genes differentially expressed in RNA sample from two different organs with p < 0.05, which is a lot. He decided to reduce the p-value to really low and get ~2000 genes. I don't think that a valid approach, is it?  Second question is that it appears to me that DeSeq2 and EdgeR only deals with paired data e.g. Drug vs. Control or WT vs. KO. If so, is there tool available to compare differentially expressed from multiple samples/conditions (e.g. 10 fibroblast samples from different parts of human body). Thanks!",True

@shuaishigao6356,2017-12-07T14:08:45Z,0,"Thanks for this amazing video Joshua! I'm a newbie in RNA-seq, and really got stuck in analyzing the cancer data from TCGA. There are more than 20k genes and 1k samples in the dataset, I wanna do a differential analysis and find the key genes in different cancer subtypes (5 in total). Could you please give me a hint of how to do this? Many thanks!!",True

@MrErPeeeG,2017-10-23T20:07:53Z,34,"According to the ""+"" in fastQ, I have heard once, that in this line it used to be a repeat of the sequence name without ""@"" at the begining, to ensure that quality regards to the sequence above, but to lower file weight it has been switched to the ""+"". That's what I have heard, but it would be worth to approve somehow this information, I have no sources to do that.",True

@Lowzenza4,2017-10-13T19:16:05Z,0,"I don't understand why low diversity is a problem at the start of the process. If the machine is trying to determine where the sequences are, why does that affect the colour in terms of diversity? I don't get it. It seems like two separate problems.",True
