@statquest,2020-11-19T00:21:09Z,42,"NOTE: People in different disciplines mean different bases when they write log(x). In Statistics and Machine Learning and most programming languages, the default base is log base 'e'. In other fields, like earthquakes, they use log base 10. Other people use log base 2. So it is important to know what base is being used in the discipline you are working in.

@someonespadre,2023-01-07T04:35:37Z,0,"My book of logarithmic trig functions are the often negative log+10. For example, to multiply sine times distance, add log.sine(+10 as given) to log.distance then subtract 10 and look up the answer. To divide distance by sine, log.distance + 10 minus log.sine then look up the answer. No negative numbers needed.  Both of my logarithm books are base 10. The log of numbers runs from 1 to 100,000 (7 place tables) and can reliably provide 7 significant figures, the 8th is uncertain. The logarithmic sine, cosine, tangents and cotangents are also 7 places, given to 1‚Äù of arc. I found these when we moved the office so I‚Äôve been using them, book, pencil and paper.",True
