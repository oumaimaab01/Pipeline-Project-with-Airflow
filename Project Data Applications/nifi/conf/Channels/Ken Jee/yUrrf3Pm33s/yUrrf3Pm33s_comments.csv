@rabago85,2020-12-06T05:48:30Z,1,How afraid should we be about choosing projects that end up failing?  Sometimes I get caught in this idea that I need to find the perfect projects that I know would be successful before I even start exploring the data.,True

@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2020-11-11T20:42:13Z,1,"WHAT?!! Good projects cannot be found in your closet, laundry, desk drawers etc ... WHY AM I ALWAYS THE LAST TO KNOW?!!!! More seriously, right now, it's not so much ideas that I have problems with at the moment, it's finding enough data to run them ... yep, that time is closing faster than I thought where I will have to learn to scrape data for myself! Especially since many of the ideas I have are around using specific type of pictures (loads of them fantasy, science fiction .... also had an idea which will requires 'solar punk' pictures, all of that in the name of ART and by using ML :o) ).   But, more likely, it will be about scrapping for text, especially released scripts from some of my favorite series ... or old books!! ( I wonder if I can do a 'whosdunnit' NLP thingy :o) ) ... so many choices, but doesn't choice imply renouncing some of said choices ? ;o)",True
@mattRRgraham1996,2020-11-09T00:43:30Z,1,"You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them,  and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact.   I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content. This channel has been immensely helpful and inspiring to me. Keep up the good work! Hopefully this large comment adds valuable data to your corpus you're building. Sorry for the special characters you'll have to get rid of when you tokenize and clean the data lol.",True
@larigiba,2020-11-08T20:46:01Z,5,"Spending a bit of time to find a good idea definitely is worth it! Once you find something you are truly passionate about, the motivation can sometimes be limitless. In my opinion, one great project is worth more than a few okay ones, because the passion can really shine through.  (Also, awesome intro :D)",True

@ogawasan5581,2020-11-07T08:30:14Z,1,"Thank you so much! i have a question that's been bothering me, if someone worked on your insightful jobs salary project, like , started it from scratch and made changes ( different eda/including ann model..) through out the project and learned a lot from it, could they include it in their resume ? if yes, i think we must reference the owner of the idea ? or is it just better to not include it ? your project inspired me a lot and made me love data science more, thank you so much and hope you will answer my question :)",True

@MrZola1234,2020-11-06T22:41:15Z,1,"Good info as always, definitely liked the analogy to coming up with new business ideas and being more specific. Question, in the sports analytics industry how much of your time is spent on various activities?  Maintaining and updating the current data analytics?  Answering new questions that are brought up by your internal customers?  Answering your own questions or coming up with new data analytics aproaches to add value?",True

@lisameyer2336,2020-11-06T19:20:17Z,3,"My first ever comment on YT (you are that good :) ) : thank you for these techniques. For total newbies like I am, that are not looking (yet) for originality but just build / practice basic skills (and self confidence in data science) few concrete common projects would help a lot. I get that it might not be super exciting for experts but your walk through Titanic was great. Maybe few more like these?

@user-ci1oj3xo6h,2020-11-06T16:12:31Z,1,"In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project. The only interesting idea I came up with (apart fromobvious linear regression) is to analyze, whether mileage is real or not based on the price, number of owners etc. It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data, than others",True

@DataProfessor,2020-11-06T15:48:06Z,8,"Wow, the video editing is amazing Ken! Lot's of nicely placed puns and humor. I totally agree with your advice that coming up with project ideas is a great skill to have. In academia, one of the most important skills to be acquired during graduate study is essentially this skill of coming up with project ideas (finding solutions for solving biological data problems). Thanks for breaking down this important topic in a compact and entertaining video üòÜüëç",True

@Ujamama,2020-11-06T14:39:11Z,1,Hi Kenji. Is there a trade-off between projects that are personally interesting vs portfoilo-worthy projects? Do your projects have to be directly tailored to whatever industry you're trying to get into or is there such a thing as a general data science portfolio? Thanks for your videos.,True
