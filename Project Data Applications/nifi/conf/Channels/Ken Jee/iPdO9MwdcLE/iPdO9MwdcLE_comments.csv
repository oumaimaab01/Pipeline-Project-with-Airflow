@miguelalba2106,2022-02-23T22:31:51Z,12,"If you want a role where you want to work only with AI and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job, if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ML and analyze data go for a data scientist job.   Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code (so it's more SE from one side), you use python for model development and c++/java for production (the role is building AI products, so you are all day reviewing, extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models, evaluate them and match required KPIs)  In the other hand, data scientists positions offer what is described in the video: statistics and data preparation (engineering) and classic ML, there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages, and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have  For example, In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve, in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change. Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes  I have been in both, my background is in statistics and I have been working as ML engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years. Personally, I can say ML engineering is more fun, even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy AI methods",True
