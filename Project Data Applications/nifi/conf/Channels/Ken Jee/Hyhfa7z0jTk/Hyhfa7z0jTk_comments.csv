@jekyl-gaming,2023-11-30T12:47:25Z,5,"If you want to actually learn about IQ I would recommend talking to a psychologist instead of researching consumer web-based IQ products.  When a psychologist tests for intelligence they use the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale version 4. This test is administered in person, and ChatGPT couldn't do it because you need to have a physical body to take the test.  If we research the embodied nature of cognition (see Metaphors we Live By - Lakoff) we learn that human cognition separated from the body is impossible - which makes us wonder what we would be measuring with the intelligence of a bot",True
@codingcrashkurse6429,2023-11-30T12:13:30Z,1,"Interesting. I did a quite extensive IQ Test too and it scored 65, which was honestly quite underwhelming. I used GPT-4-Vision and German language and it did 0/10 tasks correct in the math category.",True
