@TheMerchantOfTruth,2024-04-04T22:06:09Z,0,"He did all this in HK at the time There were only 2 tracks , now there are 3 All horses at the time and possibly still now ? ,  were domestic to HK as in no horse travelled in or out , much easier having the exact same horses running on the same 2 tracks  once/ twice a week ,Data wise .He also threw stupid money at every race trying to hit a trifecta of trifectas  ,as in the correct position of 123 horses in 3 separate races .My point  is you could not replicate this anywhere else ,HK has a small pool of horses and no horses in or out of the country like say the UK . If I must take the shine off it , it pretty much had nothing to do with the actual horses IMO it was the combination of numbers and the sheer volume of tickets that got him his wins . Just like me Playing max entries in a DFS contest week in week out your chances increase the more you play .",True

In pari-mutuel wagering, the payoffs are calculated by how much money is wagered on each horse (or combination).  What he meant is ""how much can you wager into a pool before your own bets reduce the payoffs to a point of no longer being 'value' bets"".",True

@2011blueman,2022-08-16T01:22:41Z,4,"At least in the US, data availability isn't that great unless you're willing to spend significant amounts of money. Also, most of the race tracks in the US not only don't ban the computer model betters, they actually make rakeback deals with them to give them a big advantage over the everyday better.",True
@jamesrav,2022-06-02T09:34:58Z,4,"one very important aspect that he acknowledges at the outset is that Happy Valley is a 'closed system' , meaning horses arrive on the island and stayed for the whole season (which was not that long, and they did not have races every night).  This certainly would have allowed him to better establish an accurate hierarchy (ie horse A has placed higher than horse B every time)  compared to the typical scenario of horses coming in, racing, and then off to another track (as happens in the US and UK).  Regarding suitability to today, you forget that the UK has Exchanges which operate differently than the Tote system Benter had to bet under.  The HK Jockey Club took out 18% off the top, and Benter still overcame that 'hole' and walked away a rich man.  The UK exchanges take out 1% plus a commission of 3-5% depending on who you bet with.  A much shallower hole to deal with.",True

@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-01-27T06:13:20Z,6,"A quick note on Correlated/Colinear Features. These can be a huge pain for applications such as Sports Betting, where we are weighing certain factors relative to other factors. Concepts such as introducing dropout, random noise, and using clustering to engineer/select features might be helpful. Doing that would reduce the costs of running a model, improving ROIs even if drops absolute performance",True
