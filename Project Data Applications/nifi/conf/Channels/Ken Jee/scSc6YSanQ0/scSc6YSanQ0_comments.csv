@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2021-12-10T14:13:26Z,3,"This case also put in persceptive what it is called ""the survivor bias"", in this case taking surviving plane first as the basis for reinforcement. And as said in that video, looking at downed planes was better to look where to make them better.   The survivor bias is unfortunately a wrong argument used to defend wrong positions all the times, especially by guru wanting to sell ""miraculous cure"" and taking their only survivor as an example of why their ""therapy"" ""works"".  It's the same when using super succesfull billionaires as a path to success ... while ignoring the many upon many who fail while using the exact same techniques. ( People rarely want to recognize external influences as a factor in their success especially chance !)",True
