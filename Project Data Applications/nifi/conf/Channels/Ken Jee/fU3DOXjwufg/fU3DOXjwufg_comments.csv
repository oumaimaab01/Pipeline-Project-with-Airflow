@akhilsoni729,2021-02-27T18:06:41Z,1,"Hey Ken! I  have been learning data science for the last year. and I have one problem which I often face and can't find the answer to. which learning an algorithm, we get the logic behind it. we learn the intuition behind the algorithm. but while doing a project, and actually applying those algorithms, we see a lot of parameters, literally 20-50 parameters. and I personally don't get the intuition behind all those parameters. looking at those parameters makes it more complex. when I search on the internet, it says that ""usually we use this value for this parameters "". but can't find the reason. Also, while learning deep learning, it's too difficult to find an answer to my doubt. I hope you got what my problem is... let me know your view on it.  Also, I love your content. :D",True
