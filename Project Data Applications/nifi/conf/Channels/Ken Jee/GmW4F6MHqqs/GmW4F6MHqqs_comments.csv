@prashansagupta1596,2021-03-06T15:44:03Z,4,"Hello Ken, Thanks for uploading this helpful series. It is really helping me understand the basics very well! :)     I had a question about data collection. Is data collection supposed to be a one-time process or does it have to be repeated over when the data in the source has changed? Taking the example of glassdoor, the data around salary will change over time, so how do we decide how often we should re-collect the data? And what if the website structure changes so often and hinders the scraping process? For example, this data scrapper code we referenced doesn't work very well if I run it now as many locators have changed, so I would also have to keep up with the changes in the glassdoor web structure. How to mitigate this problem?",True
@mattmovesmountains1443,2021-02-26T13:44:23Z,2,"This is huge; exactly what I was hoping to find because I couldn't visualize what a data science project really even means, where to start, etc - I'm learning on my own. I greatly appreciate the unedited process for tweaking the scraper. That stuff could be passed off as a bullet point ""collect data"", but we all know that even folks that do this daily spend some time going through what you went though in this video.   If anyone else is working on a raspberry pi or Linux system, and has issues with selenium.. let me know. I went down a rabbit hole figuring out how to set it up.",True
