I'm interested in data science and  data engineering. I'm debating between get an MS Computer Science or MS Data Science from DePaul University.   Would you advise I pursue a CS or Data Science degree if I'm interested in both fields? Also, I believe that you went to DePaul for your MS. Would you recommend DePaul's MSCS or MS Data Science program? Thanks!",True

@larigiba,2020-05-11T18:18:32Z,2,"Awesome! I think you talked about a lot of points which can be found on beginner portfolios, as you have said multiple times already, documentation is really important. I notice it personally as well, once you have 90% of the project finished the last 10% can sometimes be the most tedious, even though they are really important.   I just noticed that your channel pretty much blew up after the last video and I want to congratulate you on that! :D I was definitely sure that you would hit the 10k milestone this year but this was really a good amount quicker than I expected, so congrats to you, that was definitely well deserved!",True

@srengran4583,2020-05-11T15:57:10Z,1,"Hi Ken. Great video. Does it look bad to Data Science professionals if all of an applicant's projects rely on existing packages like scikit-learn, gensim, keras, etc.? Is it significantly helpful to applicants to have their own implementations of regression, random forests, naive bayes, etc.? in the same way that computer scientist students have their own implementations of sorts and stuff",True

Do you think I'm starting late? Could my age be a problem for finding a job on the future?  Also I'd like to know about remote work. It's possible to find out a job like that for a data scientist? If you'd make a video about it would be great.   Recently found your channel and i love it. I'm your new sub.",True
