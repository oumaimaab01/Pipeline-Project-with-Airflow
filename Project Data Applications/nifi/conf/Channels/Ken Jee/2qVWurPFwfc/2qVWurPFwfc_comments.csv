@DevlogBill,2023-04-28T03:41:41Z,1,I see where you are coming from. The definition of what a Data Scientist isn't clearly defined. Just the other day I saw a job posting on indeed for a data scientist and the requirements were very similar to a Bi Analyst role. I love learning new things about IT. My focus being a backend developer. I am still trying to understand what role Data Scientist play since it isn't clearly defined. I am assuming Data Scientist key skill is SQL? Data Science technically is a data role?,True
@EpicMicky300,2023-03-13T22:09:08Z,0,"I think there's at least two possibilities:  1. The sentiment is coming from the fact that the rigor and knowledge required for data science/analysis is becoming better understood, and thus the lack of real expertise from most applicants is becoming apparent. 2. The real growth in the data science job opportunities requires experience that a lot of applicants don't have, yet.   How many startups want a Sr. engineer to get things started?

@KrazeeKrab,2022-02-07T10:05:51Z,11,"Boy, no way this field is dying, the reason it might seem like this is because Data Science/Business IT degrees are being introduced at what feels like every University right now. There's the sentiment that IT degrees, especially in Business IT, are sort of the new MBA programmes, in that people who want to ""get rich quickly"" do them and flood the job market with what are considered short term CS skills that could end up being automated in the next 10-15 years. Now, I don't believe this to be true. I estimate Data Science is about to establish itself as its own proper (academic) field right now, which is why, suddenly, there's specific degress for it. Most people who work in DS jobs now did their degrees in math or CS, whereas the new generation will have proper DS degrees to go off. Kind of like how early programmers had math degrees, simply because Computer Science hadn't established itself as its own field yet.",True

Sure Amazon can have a whole department for data science but a small business you might be the marketing/finance guy who is also analyzing the other data sets for the company.  The field is not dying, but with tight budgets in small to midsize companies it is hard to justify hiring hiring someone who specializes in data science but cannot do any other core business function.

The general public, major business and especially the media have little to no understanding what data science and diversity of roles in this field.   Since the field is much newer than others, how would anyone who communicates about value it or hold it in regard to any other white collar job?

Why not just have ML Engineer, Software Engineer, and Analyst all under Data Operations or Data Analytics and Engineering? The need for all these titles are annoying and unnecessary.",True
@justinhuang8034,2021-11-20T19:22:31Z,1,Always a great video master master Ken! I think with Alteryx a lot of people feel a lot of these jobs are being automated and everyone can run a model.  But I found many of people who just run these workflows can't really explain the results when you ask detailed questions.

No matter whether the job of “data scientist” is around then, the skills learned in the job will be invaluable. Analysis, data architecture, machine learning, data visualization, Python and R, all of these skills will allow data scientists to be on the cutting edge of any new tools developed between then and now.

All the so-called ""smart"" ""adults"" around me said that programming was a waste of time because all the programming jobs would get outsourced to other countries anyways and that programming was too hard for people who weren't good at math (like me). Not knowing anything, I decided to listen to them.  Fast forward 4-14 years later, there are self-taught programmers who don't know much math and never went to college, who are now making high 6 figures and I missed that opportunity because I listened too much to other people when I was 12.   Don't listen to people who aren't experts in the field you are exploring.  Data science today is what HTML and web development was in 1997. It's not that new but it is still growing fast enough and there's plenty of room for more data scientists and computer programmers.",True
