@limxk14,2020-06-12T09:45:18Z,0,"hey! i just started learning data science about 1 month ago. I followed your steps to learn, I've learned python basics by doing courses on udemy for python, also for matplotlib, numpy and pandas. I also learned abit of nlp because I will be doing it for my FYP. However, now after going on Kaggle and following your advice to read and understand the expert notebooks on Kaggle. I just feel so overwelmed by how much I do not know, I find myself googling almost every line. Is this feeling normal? Should I just keep going learning this way?",True
