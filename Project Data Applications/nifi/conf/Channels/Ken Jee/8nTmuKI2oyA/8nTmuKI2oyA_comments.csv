I have been tracking my daily habits, physical exercise patterns and writing schedules for almost 6 months now. And now I think I can use this data to build a personal project or projects for my Data Analytics course. Thank you for sharing your inputs about your daily habits and how you track them.

@vishwanathmuthuraman5530,2021-05-19T09:23:04Z,1,Hey ken I just stumbled on to the field of data analytics cause I hate too much coding 😂 and came across your page and several others and this is literally calling out to me. I do have some thing I wana  ask you I’m currently taking google analytics professional certification course on coursera and they teach R instead of python. Is it absolutely necessary for me to learn python and what’s the diff between R and python? Could you give me a basic idea. Also is this google certificate worth it would it be easier landing a job with it. Sorry if I’ve asked too much but you’re very responsive on here unlike others and I would like to hear your opinion.,True

I took a break from it for a while when my husband got snipped, but i started up again when I started hoping my cycle would stop.  which has been 5 years already.    When i first started tracking my cycle, though, I also tracked acne and moods - and i was taking my temp every day, as part of cycle tracking, which also helped me track illnesses.  That was actually pretty cool.    My ob-gyn's nurse laughed at me when I brought in a chart of my cycle dates and lengths.",True
