@reslas10,2022-11-11T14:44:00Z,0,"Hi, I updated my Spyder in Anaconda, and it is broken as I stopped it because the install took too long. So my idea is not using Spyder in the base env, but create another but I want the libraries that come by default in the base env. Is there a way to install all of them easily without looking for them on by one? Many thanks",True

Now I have informed by my IT team that this is now licenced however I am unsure which version Should we install between commercial edition,team edition and enterprise edition. Our requirement is to have jupyter and Spyder and numpy and panda framework. Initially we raised request for teams edition but later got to know that it doesn't have Spyder and jupyter. Should we need the commercial edition instead? Will it have required packages mentioned. Thanks",True
