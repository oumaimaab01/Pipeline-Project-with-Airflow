@KenJee_ds,2020-06-15T03:28:31Z,6,The data science sample code is located here! https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/data_science_starter,True
@wendycaffey7354,2022-03-03T20:38:31Z,1,"I am in search of some words of advice/encouragement. I have a M.Ed degree and am going back to school for computer science. Because I already have a Masters, the school stated that I can jump right into the masters program they offer. I am excited, but super nervous that I will lack a lot of knowledge needed already for the program. Thoughts? Advice?   I am working in Codecademy over the Computer Science pathway they offer to try and get a better grasp, but I am still seeking input of a professional already in the field.",True
@surendrasatyanarayan9952,2021-10-06T08:10:26Z,0,Thanks a lot ken I was feeling very nervous and disheartened after putting 5 days in working and couldn't even complete half of the business analysis.

@piyushthakur2386,2021-03-22T14:36:39Z,0,Hey Ken . Its ok for the experienced data scientists . I have observed myself constantly looking for help on google or stack overflow on simplest topics as well. Can you make video for beginners on how to practice the data wrangling so it can become strong neural path for the same tasks. Thanks üòä,True
@Zonno5,2021-03-11T07:51:27Z,1,This is one of those open secrets. Presenting is no problem. A live coding session is scary.,True
@piyushzope10,2021-01-23T18:09:34Z,4,Thank you for sharing github link it is really helpful.... most of time our time get consumed in finding how to get started........,True

@rabago85,2020-11-20T14:41:44Z,1,"I started keeping a journal (handwritten) of various functions and methods that I knew I would want to use again.  The journal is long, but it made for quick reference when I encounter a problem that I know I‚Äôve solved before.    I think the feeling of inadequacy comes from often seeing the finished work of very experienced people and never seeing the process.  It almost makes it look like they can do it all in one go without referencing anything.",True

@mirror1023,2020-10-10T06:32:31Z,2,Best video ever!!! I feel so much better about learning to become a data scientist. And now I have a great resource I can use for my own code. Ken is awesome!!!   #66daysofdata,True
@nouashax__,2020-09-15T07:32:13Z,1,I love it when the video is exactly what's on the title.  No dragging and down to the point.  Thank you sir,True
@chaitanyamundle3713,2020-08-26T19:58:28Z,2,"Completely agreed. However, would this be a step after you get proficient with coding in python and stats/machine learning algorithms for coding interviews?",True
@liopleurodon155,2020-08-25T19:11:19Z,0,"I don't think these kind of ""secrets"" are taking credibility from data scientists. It is not about memorizing every bit of code. It's about knowing how to get help and knowing what you are looking for.",True
@MrZola1234,2020-08-18T02:00:37Z,1,Makes me think you need a good note-taking program that you are comfortable referencing.,True
@AsianBoiii1,2020-07-29T18:12:41Z,6,"You don't know how happy this video made me. I currently have impostor syndrome and I plan on applying to an internship next week. I was worried I wouldn't know enough and that I won't be able to perform to their expectations. Knowing that it's common for DS to reference their old works or constantly use outside resources is such a big relief.  If I end up getting a job, its because of you! You've contributed so much to my growth.   Thanks for everything Ken!!",True

@arrhythmia125,2020-07-21T02:10:52Z,3,I clicked the like button right before you mentioned it! üòÜ  I found this video at the perfect time. I'm at that stage where I realize how much I don't know and feeling overwhelmed and that I'll never be able to recall all of the information I've been learning. It's great to know that I'm on the right track and doing the same thing with how I am organizing my notes. New mantra: It's not shameful that I can't remember everything.,True
