@devanshverma5395,2020-07-07T09:32:03Z,2,"Really awesome ken! Every video of yours is exceptionally informative,however there's one question that,how much of data structures and algorithms i should know as compared to a software engineer when interviewing at bigwigs. I know about various things to know as a data scientist/ml but how does it differentiate you from a software engineer,a little more insight on what these ""coding"" requirements are is needed. Thanks in advance!",True

I mean would it be worth spending my time ? Here's  the draft of it.  https://mevluthancerkiran.shinyapps.io/firstproject/ (I had no data so I used a pseudo data.)

I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics and I would like to convert into Data scientist. I have some questions for you and I thank you in advance for your answers. - with my statistician background, do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience? - I have completed datascience 365 bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there. - how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise, because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it.  Thanks a lot and I don't know if I can get your mail for further discussions. Thanks",True
