@88fjoe,2021-08-15T05:46:59Z,1,as a newcomer to golf during the pandemic I'm absolutely hooked by the sport and find your content a gem :) hopefully more and more golf equipment manufacturers will incorporate ML/AI into the process of making the clubs which also present itself as a great marketing opportunity such as what Callaway is already doing. I'm hopeful that the future of the golf simulation market relys on visual based ML/AI and will drive the costs down for the barrier of entry so that more ppl can enjoy golfing at home!,True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-03-22T17:30:25Z,1,"#66: Last video of this round, and was about Golf. I think is a coincidence ðŸ¤“ Ken, thank you for the #66daysofdata challenge, really helped me to evaluate & organize my time, I feel a little bit more confident of my knowledge in DS, now I have more ideas on how to move forward in my projects, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have access to new courses (Udemy & NVIDIA). I will keep moving forward, and because this initiative has helped that much I will start Round 3 right away, videos will be on this one too but I will be more focused on projects, I will share them for sure!!
