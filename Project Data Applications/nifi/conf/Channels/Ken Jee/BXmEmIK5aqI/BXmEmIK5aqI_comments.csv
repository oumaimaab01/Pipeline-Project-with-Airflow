@Jalen0x,2019-12-08T00:40:08Z,0,Appreciate the vids man. Love that you incorporate NBA analytics in your channel üëç  Any recommendations for becoming a self taught DS? Taking the DataQuest DS/Python course right now. It's been more hands on than other ones like Coursera which helps me learn better.  Any suggestions to accelerate the journey would be awesome. Thanks man.  #GiannisWinsMVP,True
@PascalBrunHaiti,2019-12-06T17:17:12Z,5,"Hey Ken, I'm a systems engineer and aspiring Data Scientist in Haiti, trying to incorporate automation and analytics in as many data structures as I can here (as this field is basically non-existent in my country). As your channel is relatively new and growing, I wanted to make a point to say thank you for your time and attention to detail in your videos. They're not only extremely educational and helpful, but have also helped me stay motivated to keep learning in a field where I am alone and have to rely on virtual help from individuals like yourself. Hope this message serves as encouragement to keep going, and to know that your efforts are seen and appreciated across borders. All the best, Pascal Brun",True
