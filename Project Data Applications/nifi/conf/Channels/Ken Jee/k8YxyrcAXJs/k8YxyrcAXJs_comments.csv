@kartikeyatripathi2213,2021-09-19T14:55:40Z,0,"Hi ken jee, just a quick question….what’s the best way to scrap data from more than 10000 urls in a short period of time…..i have a project where every url takes around 1 sec to extract data but the urls are sooo damn many that it takes ages……is there any solution to this problem……",True
@shrutijain1628,2021-09-17T08:36:07Z,1,I like the visualization video i think i have already commented about it but i had a question what is most used s visual libraries  which has better visualization option?  i have been using matplotlib and seaborn for a while but i know i have to go with trend of plotly so do you think plotly something worth learning when you already know matplotlib and seaborn? Thank you!!,True

@sohaismail2503,2021-08-27T04:16:53Z,1,"Hey Ken. Nice video. I am an experienced economist. I have a a BA and MA  in economics and finance. I have worked for 8 years in economics and econometrics. This basically entails extensive data analysis and statistics around economic issues, so I am very good with statistics, regressions, inference, and causality (a big thing in econometrics). However, in economics we mostly use Stata as the go to software. I am really interested in shifting to data science as I have a huge passion for data analysis. I need to learn the languages commonly used in data science (R, python…) but I am strong on the statistical background. Any insights on what’s best and where to start keeping in mind that I am currently a full-time economist. So the transition has to be gradual or more like a side-hustle in the beginning. Thanks",True
@shilpakarra7059,2021-08-27T03:49:46Z,1,"Just started a Module in my Google Data Analytics Course where I get to learn about Data Visualisation. As a kid I was always into sketching, colouring or some form of Imagery. As I grew up I could identify and nurture my storytelling skills. So far, with whatever I have read and learnt about Data Visualisation it seems like a party for an art and design lover like me who also loves storytelling. And this video of yours nails it to the end. I just hope I do well and make the most of data visualisation Module now.",True

@piyushzope10,2021-08-21T07:08:16Z,6,While watching I came across one quote  Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories. ―Al Shalloway 🙌,True
@piyushzope10,2021-08-21T07:06:26Z,5,I was very surprised and impressed when I saw the graphs and visualisation in trading apps... They are very helpful to understand many tiny aspects and indeed looks beautiful 😍,True
@MrViperHiggins,2021-08-20T22:00:58Z,2,Great video Ken couldn't agree more man. Data visualisation is the key translation tool for data scientists -> business stakeholders. Keep it up dude,True

@BharatR97,2021-08-20T19:37:02Z,1,"Data Visualization is an art and a science in itself! And well, who says no to looking at some beautiful drawings and pictures? ""A graph is worth a thousand tables"" even if the tables are stored in a graph database? 😜",True

@InsideTheProduct,2021-08-20T15:43:39Z,1,"As a product person who loves data and data visualizations I love your video. Maybe one question, how do you work with your data scientist if repeatedly asking for easy to understand dashboards and typically we get dashboards that take minutes to interpret each graph and explain repeatedly? I know product people can be cryptic as well 🤣 love your vids Ken!",True
@arthurmiller5276,2021-08-20T15:42:06Z,1,"While ""a picture is worth a thousand words"", the RIGHT picture is far more meaningful as many artist / photographers might point out.   I recently did an assessment where lots of questions were about which visualization conveyed a particular point or what statement is represented.",True
@shrutijain1628,2021-08-20T15:29:30Z,2,Visuals makes everything understandable and presentable 💯 Very informative ken loving this 🎉,True
@DataProfessor,2021-08-20T15:27:41Z,7,"3:38 The ""papaya plot"" is certainly a great alternative to the ""pie chart"" and ""is extremely effective for conveying complicated info in a digestible way"". 😆 Jokes aside, this is a nice and concise video on the importance of data viz. It is certainly one of the funnest part of a data science project, sometimes I would be lost in the zone of customizing plots for countless hours.",True
@rudymoralesjr,2021-08-20T15:07:30Z,1,Would this be a correct analogy? Data Analyst = Front-End Data Engineer = Back-End Data Scientist = Full Stack,True
@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2021-08-20T15:05:18Z,4,"I love to see Data visualizations in everything ! I remember as a child I used to play soccer on PlayStation 2 a lot, and they had plenty of charts like radar charts for players and teams to rank them by skill (attack, defense, speed, ... ), trees to rank players and clubs in different leagues, soccer fields with different sized circles to show ball possession ... It was awesome, we would literally spend 10 minutes before each match just looking at the graphs to choose the best Formation. I don't think we would've liked PS2 as much without those visualizations, even as kids they generated high value for us as consumers and for the company as a business.",True

@codingcrashkurse6429,2021-08-20T13:05:29Z,6,"Yesterday I had a presentation in front of some managers where I showed what we did in our team in the last 12 weeks. I am the only data scientist who also does frontend engineering work and I can tell your guys that the difference between a ""ah nice job"" and ""wow this is awesome"" is when people are able to SEE the results. We are very visual creatures, never forget that :-)",True
