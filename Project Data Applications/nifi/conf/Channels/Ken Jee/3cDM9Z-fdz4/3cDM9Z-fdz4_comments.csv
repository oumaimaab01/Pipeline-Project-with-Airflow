@VDEP2727,2023-11-15T00:34:20Z,1,Wahoowa! Taking a Data Analytics in a Sports Context course at Darden now and came across your channel. Keep it up!,True
@caydenplummer9119,2022-04-04T17:44:16Z,1,Does the PGA still use historical benchmarks for sg in terms of yardages? I feel like keeping a dynamic calculation for real-time analysis would improve to accuracy of the statistic especially since the purpose seems to be in line with that expectation.,True
@djcardwell,2022-03-16T01:29:48Z,1,dude you have my dream job. Hire me when I'm finished at Apple.,True
@rmkky2470,2022-02-28T23:40:28Z,1,"hey, thanks for the video. I wanted to ask where do you get the stats for golf? I'm looking for historical data of each player for each game they played.",True
@piyushzope10,2021-03-17T10:24:00Z,3,Thanks for explaining the technique. It is really interesting...,True
@ryansteinke2178,2021-02-20T04:00:43Z,1,"Hey Ken, Thanks for the video. I'm curious as to how the expected score is calculated? A 150 yrd approach shot at the US Open from the rough and the same shot at an average tour event don't have the same expected score. Does SG score these 2 shots as equals?  Another example could be year over year SG stats at the same tournament held at the same course. How are course conditions and weather factored into a players SG score.   Essentially what I am after is this, are strokes gained calculated in isolation within the same round, tournament, PGA tour Season, or every PGA golf shot ever taken?",True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-01-28T15:48:09Z,1,"#25: I had to google every single concept about golfüèåüèª, not a fan here, but the metric about strokes gained gave me some insight, some questions:  - How I can find metrics for some sports that not have a deep study, just checking variables and play with them? - Do you recommend a way to approach (course, book) how to find those metrics? You hit the point on this one, spark curiosity for me!! #66daysofdata",True
@JuanRodriguez-wk7mm,2021-01-05T05:19:47Z,1,Where do you find these expected values or the bench mark? Like just from PGA your stats? Trying to figure out how I can calculate my own Strokes gained at my home club.,True
@kimshin12,2020-05-02T00:59:48Z,1,Thanks for explaining stroke gained clearly. It is very informative.,True
