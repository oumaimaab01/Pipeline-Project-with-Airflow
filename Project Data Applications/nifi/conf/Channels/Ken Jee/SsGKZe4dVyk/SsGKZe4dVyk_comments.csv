@waynezurowski9279,2021-05-12T23:52:59Z,2,"Ken - Thanks a ton for the prompt response!  I figured I'd reply to your message in the new comment field - I've had difficulties posting replies to replies off comments in the past.  It's funny you mentioned a lawyer making the transitioned into the field.  Actually, I know a guy who made a virtually identical transition into a CS/DS related field.  Personally, I don't possess that sort of professional esteem.  I've worked a variety of jobs including tennis teaching pro/coach, commercial painting estimator, warehousing, etc.  Unfortunately, I never earned my Bachelor's.  While I came within range and have taken a series of biz-ad courses at a couple of comm colleges, I can't say that a degree is part of my repertoire.   With all that being said, do you still think investing in a bootcamp would be the way to go?  Would it perhaps be better for someone with my set of circumstances to at least pursue an Associates in Biz with a concentration in D Analytics?  Indeed includes many Data Analyst positions where at least an Associates is preferred.  I've also read articles stating that holding a Bachelor's is virtually a necessity in terms of getting one's foot in the door as a data analyst. Thanks again for your inspiring channel.  I look forward to combing through all of your videos as I attempt to traverse this arduous journey to becoming  a seasoned data scientist such as yourself.",True
@waynezurowski9279,2021-05-12T18:41:04Z,1,Thank you for the insightful video.  I do have a few questions that have been lingering on my mind: would it be beneficial for a 36-year-old - who works full time - to at least pursue an associates in math and/or comp sci?  Perhaps blend that with taking edX/Data Quest/365 DSM?  I've been messing around with some Kaggle projects as well.   Thanks again.,True
@Thistle780,2021-03-31T21:55:40Z,1,Very insightful. I wish you could interview a family woman who succeeds in getting her first data science job.,True

@glennhighcoveexploresstuff,2020-08-30T21:36:00Z,2,"After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a  week in.  The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R.  So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky.  Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month.  I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge.  I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge.  Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.  Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic, and honest, appraisals of solutions.  Thanks again!",True
@lasky929,2020-08-29T12:15:59Z,1,This video was a huge shot of motivation. I've been using the past couple of months to begin my own journey towards working in the Data Analytics field since losing my job to COVID. This interview was extremely helpful in reinforcing some of the things I was already doing as well as making me aware of the things I wasn't. Congratulations to Ray on his success in breaking into the Data Analytics field and thank you to Ken for providing such helpful content in this area.,True

Started just 1.5 months ago and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of topics I need to learn. One thing that really bothers me is that I don't know how deeply I need to understand a particular topic. For example, python. Numpy, pandas, etc. How much of it is required to be able to work effectively with data? Any suggestions Ken?",True

@gdimask,2020-08-20T15:58:40Z,2,"What he said about ""not understanding Kaggle notebook"" is very relatable! I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science. When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time, I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process. As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle, taking other courses, and just playing around with some dataset, I slowly began to understand other people's work.   All that is to say: be patient, keep learning and keep tinkering with datasets. It's a marathon not a sprint. You will be surprised by your progress. :)",True

@larigiba,2020-08-19T17:36:01Z,1,Learning from other code examples is definitely very helpful in my opinion as well. Sometimes you just need to see a hands-on example of a function being used and it just clicks. Knowing someone on the inside surely is helpful and that my network is something I want to put in more effort into as well. Thanks for the review!
