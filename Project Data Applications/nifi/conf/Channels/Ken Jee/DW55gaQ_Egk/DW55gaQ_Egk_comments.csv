@reydavid7300,2020-08-03T05:31:45Z,1,"Hey Kan Lee I am doing a project like foodcouver, but I created a scrapper for various websites. As a result I have thousands of text reviews and ratings. Do you think it is good for a project to mention how did I got the data but no which websites I used? My goal is a recommendation system with aggregated data, of course free. But I am afraid that some of the websites may not like this idea. How am I supposed to scrape if many websites restringe their use? I would like to know what do you think Thanks!",True

@larigiba,2020-04-27T16:39:52Z,5,"Hey Ken, (warning: longer comment incoming) I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking ""Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel"", but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard. It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering). I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel. With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%. I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping. If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this, recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau! I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)",True
