@a_vickyp8360,2021-03-19T17:06:37Z,2,"#64: I never had the chance to have time on Fridays or Saturdays for 66 Days of Data, today was my lucky day! I do like the one that gives insights to make decisions or help the athletes to improve performance. In the past was difficult to keep track of how an athlete was responding to the training loads, how was sleeping, how was recovering with all the variables that differ from gender to position in the game (or sport).  It's fascinating to see how some products and the Data Science applied have helped organizations, coaches, and athletes to find the invisible reasons for bad performance or injury :)  On that, I think that the psychological component it's not being evaluated, which could be a great area to focus too! #66daysofdata",True
