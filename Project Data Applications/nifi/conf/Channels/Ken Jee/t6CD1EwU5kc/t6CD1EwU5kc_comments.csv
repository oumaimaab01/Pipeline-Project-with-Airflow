I would appreciate your opinion on whether you think a bootcamp is a preferred method of learning DS fundamentals, or if I would be better off using less expensive classes that cover the same material? IMPORTANT: My employer is offering to pay for a bootcamp, so that's my main reason for considering one (if I were paying myself I would probably not entertain a bootcamp). I guess I'm asking: ""Do you think the structure and material organization in a bootcamp would be significantly better/faster for learning DS fundamentals?"" If not, I'll save my employer some money and they'll be happy about that. Also to your point in this video, I can probably create a more individualized learning path for my employers specific needs outside of a bootcamp. Thanks again for all your awesome content!",True

For your audience out there, I would like to add that becoming a data scientist is a journey, and it can be longer than you expected.  Length depends on your prior knowledge and your goal post. Also, expect to modify your goals along the way.  If after 6 months you can‚Äôt make any progress, then you can revisit your goal.  Some percentage of people who try will realize this is not for them or that they have minimal aptitude for it. That‚Äôs perfectly fine and normal. Your efforts to study Data Science will still be useful in any other field you go into, since some familiarity with AI is becoming a necessity.  Otherwise if after 6 months you do see yourself making some progress, then great. Make a small course correction based on what you have learned, and set your next 6 month goal.  Repeat until you land a job.  Then repeat some more as you advance in your career.  üòä",True
