@trevormiller931,2020-05-11T12:23:15Z,1,"I'm a work from home data scientist. Just started this year. Thanks so much for the tips and suggestions. Definitely will give them a try.   My coworkers work in a different time zone, and so I have to adjust my schedule to match theirs. However, that's a struggle in of itself as it means late days (even though I start late). Any suggestions on how I can remedy this? Thanks!",True

@DataProfessor,2020-04-20T14:49:07Z,1,"Thanks Ken for the work from home tips, agree with you that a dedicated work space helps to boost productivity. What also works for me is a good background music as a sort of white noise (helps to be in the zone).",True

@LewiUberg,2020-04-20T13:37:22Z,2,"I have worked and studied from home for many years, and agree with you on 1, that one is Key, separate the roles.  2 is not that easy I find it. I usually don't have much downtime before it did for the day, but 5 minutes here and there when needed. But I do make a prioritized task list. 3. I have turned off all notifications except SMS and phone calls :) 4. I have my ""big break"" as a workout in the garage around mid-day. 5 is also a great tip. 6..... Yeah! no progress for me, haha!  You did not as for my opinion, but I wanted to share to point out that even though we don't do the same things, our goal is structure :)",True
