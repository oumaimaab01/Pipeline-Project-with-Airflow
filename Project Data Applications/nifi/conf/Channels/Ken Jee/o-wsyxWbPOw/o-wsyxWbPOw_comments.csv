@KenJee_ds,2022-01-03T06:08:45Z,18,Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know how you feel about this assessment below? Was I overly critical?,True
@rodrigoaquino2968,2022-02-14T20:54:03Z,1,I'm addicted to this channel... Hello from Brazil,True
@optimizedpran1247,2022-01-12T22:42:50Z,1,My only complaint might be that they made it too easy and the value of the cert might not be that high.,True
@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-01-10T09:00:41Z,1,I think with ML I've had to deal with writing testing protocols for evaluating multiple kinds of protocols. That seems to be something that a lot of online courses miss,True
@BeautyByJuliette14,2022-01-09T01:15:44Z,1,I agree with everything said in this video! Nice to see new content from you in the new year.,True
@machinelearning3518,2022-01-08T06:04:38Z,1,Great Video,True
@cwpeterson87,2022-01-07T22:01:56Z,2,"My immediate reaction was ""how do I know 90% of people aren't cheating on this"" and that discouraged me from taking it.",True
@analisamelojete1966,2022-01-07T20:08:34Z,1,"One friend who’s a principal ML engineer at Kopernikus automotive told me that the best way to show your skills in ML is to have projects, products or contributing to open source.  No badges or certificates will replace that.",True
@maxbaugh9372,2022-01-07T04:42:18Z,1,"I was initially excited by the ML assessment, doubly so when I scored in the top 5%,  but the second that excitement wore off I realized that the assessment was too weak to mean anything. Almost as confirmation of this, a friend of mine who doesn't do Data Science or ML passed it on a whim (he then proceeded to score in the top 5% of 4 or 5 other CS related assessments). Certifications need to be *hard* in order to carry any weight, a lesson many people seem extremely reluctant to learn.",True

@DATAcated,2022-01-05T22:22:03Z,1,Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the assessment.,True
@fawzishafei5565,2022-01-05T12:23:04Z,1,I give you FIVE STAR for this video . I agree with what you have said. For Corp HR who put such  rocky assessment management to do such idea in the first place. Then the question why we say degree in college or certification in boot camp created by pro in the field and not HR clerks in a corporate. Thanks.,True
@CodeEmporium,2022-01-05T03:21:28Z,1,"Yea. I agree about your thoughts on the credibility of this assessment. But even as a business leader, I cannot imagine this helps either. Business leaders should understand how Machine Learning can affect their products, services, and branding. I cannot imagine that knowing what the nearest point in a K-nearest neighbor algorithm matters at all to them.",True
@LeonLokk,2022-01-04T21:47:00Z,1,I like LinkedIn but had no idea they had an ML assessment. Thanks for sharing!,True
@dolusolana2127,2022-01-04T18:58:56Z,1,"True, I have one and you're right.",True
@samslomowitz,2022-01-04T15:18:11Z,2,"Ken, Thank you for the video. I believe LinkedIn's Job Search algorithm is more optimized if one has the preferred skill badge. It helps the user find relevant companies rather than help companies find skilled applicants. Let me know if you agree. Thank you again for your videos. I really enjoy them.",True
@nikitajesaibegjans2458,2022-01-04T13:15:23Z,1,"Completely agree, I took this assessment applying for jobs this year, but it doesn't provide any value for people taking it or people hiring!",True
@Wlaki89,2022-01-04T09:28:20Z,2,"I did not use Google for the this assessment and got top 15%, which is great IMO.  But I do agree that terminology-based quick test is not really proof of any real-world DS/ML skill.",True

@liudmylataranenko4751,2022-01-03T23:48:54Z,3,"From my perspective these assessments are more for candidates than for employers. You can take test and compare your result with others.  The questions are interesting and not trivial, about algorithms, theory, different methods. Why not. I think that coding skill is secondary.",True
@missing2070,2022-01-03T23:48:29Z,1,Thanks. Your video will save many people's time.  I wonder what will happen if your video is shared on LinkedIn lol,True
@mattRRgraham1996,2022-01-03T23:15:38Z,2,"So I took this on two accounts (my main account and my burner account). The one on my main account I took without cheating and I was curious to see how I'd do. I took it almost exactly one year ago today (apparently, I took it on 1/5/21) and I passed and it's on my profile because I got in that top 30%. When I got hired and throughout all of my interviews, it literally never came up. Not once. Nobody was like, ""hey, we noticed this on your profile."" They saw my math undergrad degree, my stats grad degree I was finishing, my research, and work experience.   On my main burner account, I took it to see if it's possible to cheat all the answers and it's super easy. I could give this to my sister who hates anything related to math/stats/programming, and if she googled all the questions she'd pass and get it on her profile. Definitely useless as an assessment. Nice video homie.",True

@AaronMOliver,2022-01-03T20:59:31Z,1,"Good points.  I do think maybe this cert could show that a manager knows what various ML terms mean, but that's about it.",True
@LukeBarousse,2022-01-03T20:56:11Z,28,"Ken, hear me out on this one... The people NEED a ""Ken Jee Approved for Data Science Assessment"" on LinkedIn!  Now that's an assessment I (and others... I think...) would take!!!",True
@awds121,2022-01-03T20:34:09Z,5,"Hey Ken! Great video! I haven’t taken the ML assessment, but did take Python and SQL quizzes. Passed both, but I believe companies shouldn’t put significant weight on LinkedIn badges. Specifically, Python and SQL assessments tested very specific knowledge that aren’t necessarily useful to me in my projects. My criticism is based on the assumption that these assessments are designed for testing someone if they are qualified to worked at LinkedIn. With that, it is a great idea if LinkedIn can add a feature for one to display their projects. After all, experience comes from practice, no :)",True
@anmorgan24,2022-01-03T19:52:33Z,4,"I completely agree. I was nervous to take the ML assessment and assumed that, if anything, my first try would just help prepare me for what specifically to study more before retaking (because with only 15 questions, how would ML ""in general"" be covered?) Needless to say I was shocked at how basic the assessment was (and also how poorly it represented ML concepts). The vast majority of the questions I got addressed the bias-variance tradeoff... and there were a couple of terminology questions if I remember correctly. I don't think you were overly critical at all. I think you gave some great suggestions on alternative approaches that would help tech people better showcase their skills and I'd love to see LinkedIn implement some of your ideas!",True
@arthurmiller5276,2022-01-03T18:10:49Z,2,"Ultimately the two factors are: the quality of the assessment and how well particular assessments are trusted and utilized by companies. (A third might be whether a particular assessment is relevant to a particular job. Evaluating someone for a starting position versus a senior position are two slightly different things.)  Google's own assessments might be fine for evaluating potential candidates for themselves or possibly other FAANG (. . . . or should that now be MAANG?) company, but is the level of expectations and requirements the same across the board for any company?  Assessments, certifications, diplomas, work experience, etc all have as much or as little weight on a resume as a particular recruiter / hiring manager applies to them.",True
@Major_Data,2022-01-03T17:50:31Z,2,"Ken, if you've got to kiss Linkedin's ass on their crappier aspects to be a Top Voice, then we're both screwed... 🤣",True
@0x007A,2022-01-03T17:22:12Z,1,"LinedIn will never hire anyone based on such assessments. I guarantee if you create a fake name, resume, take the assessment and then apply to LinkedIn for a machine learning engineer position with the company. Report on the outcome, Ken.",True
@binksterb,2022-01-03T16:39:27Z,0,"Happy New Years Ken, first I had not heard of it, maybe I am reading this wrong, I have put considerable time into learning Data Science, which takes years not a few questions. I still  am not where I want to be, but at least I know where I am going.  You want to people to know your stuff then participate in Kaggle. Like you I like LinkedIn, but they really can do better.",True
@lecryptojames,2022-01-03T16:13:00Z,5,"I think overall, the assessments may not necessarily be a solid indicator because I could just have a second screen to google ASAP. Haha I did that for a few. Also true it would be great if you can endorse AND comment to showcase why or how someone has used a given skill.",True
@okafindo5362,2022-01-03T16:04:38Z,1,I haven’t taken any Linkedin assessments exactly because of this reason,True
@roshinifer,2022-01-03T15:44:03Z,2,You are 100% correct Ken. From a this kind of assessment taking there is no value for a data science learner to improve his/her skills and no value for recruiters as well. As a learner I tried that test and only had a small enjoyment for publishing and completing some task related to data science. For true skills development or recruiting processes it doesn't give any value. ♥️,True
@piyushzope10,2022-01-03T15:13:31Z,6,"Yes, I was initially impacted by these free certification... It's a bad trap in these days... We must instantly get out of it and must empower ourselves with recognising the resources which are really valuable to learn.",True
@GregHogg,2022-01-03T14:56:36Z,2,I don't think I like *any* of the LinkedIn badges... I agree fully,True

@harshitsati,2022-01-03T14:03:45Z,2,I am commenting again because idk where my comment went so when I first gave the ML test I passed it with flying colors but then my friend told me about this github repo that has all the answers to different linkedin assessments which made me kind of sad because that meant the assessment isn't worth much lol,True
@pluto5200,2022-01-03T13:59:59Z,1,Thanks. I'm not even going to try LinkedIn learning,True
@anubhavgoyal3211,2022-01-03T13:56:20Z,4,I agree with you Ken. I haven't heard about it before and surely wasn't expecting this from LinkedIn. They should be checking practical knowledge of people considering the type of platform it is. Really poor from their side.,True
@DataProfessor,2022-01-03T13:43:51Z,36,I love LinkedIn also and really enjoyed your constructive feedbacks. I agree that the ML assessment is really superficial and does not critically assess one's ML skill sets.,True
@supermarkethobo9567,2022-01-03T13:28:13Z,3,"Do employers even care about these ""assessments""? They don't even care about MOOC's which take up a lot more time and effort. A lot of the places I applied to made me do shitty assessments like these. One tested me on super niche Python features like wtf.",True
@williamguesdon400,2022-01-03T13:24:58Z,2,I did the R assessment a while back. The questions were not very relevant to my experience. It might be better now.,True
@CENTRALEAGLE68,2022-01-03T13:23:40Z,2,Took it and got the badge,True
@shrutijain1628,2022-01-03T13:23:38Z,6,LinkedIn has been game changer for many people and also me but I agree that linkedin has pros and cons and i think there assesment is not something we should relive on 💯.  And I totally agree with Ken that badges and Certificate won't get you job 🙌,True
@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2022-01-03T13:21:19Z,4,Ken sensei restoring my self-esteem after closing the R assessment halfway Haha .. If it wasn't titled R assessment I wouldn't have known it was for R lol,True
