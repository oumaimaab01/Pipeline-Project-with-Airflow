@kumawatrohan,2021-03-07T23:13:38Z,1,Thankyou so much for this information Ken❤️ No doubt you told everything about it but I'll also read the paper❤️🤩,True
@pal999,2021-01-04T14:59:53Z,1,Thanks for breaking this down for everyone! One thing that caught my attention is about the sad truth - so technically you can find viral videos and basically duplicate them with same tags and it works?!,True
@annbabyjane1696,2021-01-04T04:43:26Z,1,Wow thank you !,True
@evanfisher4943,2020-12-10T03:09:43Z,2,"This was actually really helpful! I’m researching for my own future channel, but I’m thinking about making a program that takes samples of YouTube videos, and samples yours and marker what similaritys it had on low viewed and high viewed videos.",True
@TheWeekendFriend,2020-09-13T19:52:47Z,1,3 things: 1. CAPTIVATE and DIGITAL MINIAMLISM are great. I aim to read the rest on your shelf. 2. ooooo alchemy 3. thanks for sharing such VALUED content. Keep it up!  cheers!,True
@SadhguruUnofficial,2020-09-06T10:15:42Z,1,Awesome tips! Thank you! Will implement that on my channel)),True
@azyn1525,2020-09-05T09:33:09Z,1,"I can't completely say that this is relatable to the video's topic but theres a website called invidio.us where you are able to know the percentage of engagement, rating, family rating, and also the wilson score of any video. For any the data analysts out there, I guess this can be a bit helpful to analyse your video's status. :)",True
@sidagarwal43,2020-08-29T14:48:41Z,0,"Hi Ken I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together.  So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific. Link - https://github.com/2000siddharth/web_scraping_classification/blob/master/EDA_YT.ipynb  Thanks for always making amazing content.",True
@Shiffo,2020-08-26T21:41:26Z,1,"Thanks for sharing, i found your channel 6 months ago and your video's have definitely improved!",True
@justStardust940,2020-08-22T20:15:12Z,1,Does the dislike button hurt or help creators?,True
@riceboybebop7018,2020-08-21T03:17:29Z,1,This channel makes data science more easy to digest piece by piece in an interesting way! Also how old are you at this point and what age did you get your sports analysis job? Just need to get a relative idea of my progress lmao,True
@slavabrodetskiy2209,2020-08-18T15:36:50Z,1,Really well done!,True

@margotg54M3R,2020-08-17T11:45:30Z,1,"Oh no, now I'm going to get video recommendations on how to beat the algorithm...",True
@Cindy-qc7lo,2020-08-17T11:36:38Z,1,What constitutes the end of the video? I know some Youtubers put their ads/sponsorships at the end of the video but if someone doesn’t watch that last part of the video because of the ads is that the end of the video? I know the ending screens can take up the last 10 seconds of the video so is it one minute till the end of the video or 10 seconds to the end of the video.,True
@JosephRivera517,2020-08-16T06:21:44Z,1,This is a compelling content. I have been watching a lot of videos that say it is just about the algorithm. Yours is different.,True
@uno5819,2020-08-16T04:51:28Z,1,Is there a way to to confuse the algorithm to shuffle random videos instead of the learnt pattern?,True
@kushagrayadav.fitness,2020-08-15T14:16:41Z,1,"great stuff ken, I would love to see an interview of YT data scientist...",True
@ravitanwar9537,2020-08-15T08:07:39Z,2,amazing move at 1:37,True
@julianwalter3083,2020-08-15T07:19:43Z,2,funny that the YouTube algorithm recommended me this video,True
@silent.-killer,2020-08-15T05:30:57Z,1,Great video man!  I am curious to hear your definition of 'maximising reach' as it was one of the key takeaways but was seemingly brushed over?,True
@jeffreyugochukwu1942,2020-08-15T03:43:19Z,1,"Funnily enough, I literally found this video on my recommendations from the algorithm you just explained XD. In all seriousness, this is great content as always",True

@TheElementFive,2020-08-15T01:52:45Z,1,"Hey Ken! Kind of a random question but, in an interview, how would you go about describing a data science project you did that involved web scraping (in particular the ethics of it)? Big fan!",True
@zeinat2233,2020-08-14T23:05:03Z,3,Commenting for the algorithm,True
@mdk0705,2020-08-14T20:21:40Z,2,"Great video Ken. Do you happen to know if when you use a multi-word keyword like ""Data Science Tutorial"" will it be part of the search result for the term ""tutorial"" or do you have to have a separate keyword for ""tutorial"" by itself also.",True
@justinhuang8034,2020-08-14T20:15:36Z,1,Haha I always love those 2010 random recommendations. Great video as always!,True
@artyb3115,2020-08-14T20:02:24Z,1,"I'm sure there is more to the algorithm. I have a video on my other account sitting for 2,5 years and it's been pretty stable in views. The key is - it was searched for explicitly. It worked actually even after the 3 days you mentioned.",True
@kennethmeacham6368,2020-08-14T19:04:36Z,1,just commenting to beat the algorithm. great stuff!,True
@DataProfessor,2020-08-14T17:39:34Z,1,"Awesome video! The throwing of the research paper was hilarious! For all the advises that you are giving, you are practically demonstrating them in action, amazing 👍",True
@richardsuwandi2723,2020-08-14T17:37:21Z,1,"I've recently been learning about recommender systems and It's interesting to know how YouTube's algorithm works, especially when dealing with the cold start problem. Great video, Ken!",True
@mishan_uragan,2020-08-14T16:43:02Z,1,"Thanks for great content, Ken! Can you make a video about math: what kind of math do you use in job, what part of math is need to know necessarily?",True
@Algovibes,2020-08-14T15:59:30Z,1,Regarding your insane growth rate you definitely cracked the YT-Algorithm. KEN JEE Problems: 3:34 -> 64k  Growing that fast that your subscribe button is not up to date :-D,True
@ninadtengse7993,2020-08-14T15:50:05Z,1,Hope you get the opportunity to interview a DS from YouTube! Can you ask him/her if they have noticed any (adverse) effects of optimising to boost the viewing time on the long term engagement of a user?,True
@ogawasan5581,2020-08-14T15:40:12Z,2,Ken giving a tip on how to keep people watching till the end and at the same time giving an example by telling us some insights will be given in the end ...Brilliant 😂,True
@larigiba,2020-08-14T15:14:30Z,3,Great details! I loved the visual explanation you put in at 3:44 and when you threw the paper into the back I could not supress a small laugh :D,True
