@joserubio3036,2022-01-21T14:32:13Z,1,Hey Ken! I am almost finishing my university degreed in market research & marketing and I am going to focus in data science/data engineering. Currently my friends are telling me to buy a M1 Macbook but I am not sure about compatibilities with OSX and I am not familiarised with Macs (I have always being a Windows user). Do you think it is a good idea or is it better to stick with this Zbooks or any other similar Windows laptop?,True
