Do you think this video is still relevant for 2023 and that this is still the best way for a data science / data analytics portfolio to show to employers? Or is there a more 'state-of-the-art' method  today that people use to make their portfolios?  I'm about to begin my journey to learn data analytics from next month and I wish to record my learning process (what I learn every week) and organize my future projects somewhere to show to employers, and I'm wondering if this is still the best method that exists out there.",True

I found this https://orysyastus.github.io/ github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it.   But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch? And the other thing I worry about it is what if like 5,000 other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol.
