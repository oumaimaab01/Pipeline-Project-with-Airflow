@88fjoe,2021-08-15T05:03:10Z,1,"It's obvious to many that the current 3pt line is not far enough from the rim but it's fascinating to see that there's data backing it up and to pinpoint to where the ideal distance is, super fascinating work! It's no wonder that more and more teams such as the Utah Jazz are trying to eliminate the mid-range 2's entirely and replace those with 3's instead, but it's also interesting to see players like CP3 does not shy away from the mid-range 2's in the clutch (and has the full freedom to do so) likely backed by their individual statistics that is way above the league average thus making it a worthwhile shot.",True
@piyushzope10,2021-03-12T08:28:31Z,3,I was really anaware about the points system in basketball üèÄ it's really good analysis...  One thing is sure that players need to be focused on  from where they are throwing a basketball towards the hoop üòÄ It makes the game challenging and may increase customer engagement...,True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-02-16T18:34:25Z,1,"#40: Inspirational project video here! When I watched the graphs, and then the Steph Curry one, I thought about the sweet spot on finding insights from the best players to transfer that to coaches who train new talents.  Somehow the data can lead to something. I'm positive about that! #66daysofdata",True
@puureshooter7,2020-11-26T16:47:43Z,0,"Technically speaking, shouldn‚Äôt the 3 point line ideally be around 5-10 feet from the rim due to the rapid organic drop in fg% from 60% to 40% you pointed out at 1:59? And then move the free throw line back to 25 feet, have all shooting fouls yield 2 free throws except and-1s which would still be 1 ft. This makes the ev for 2s, 3s, and non and-1 ft trips equal at roughly 1.2. (Given the average ft% now is about 75% at 15 feet, I‚Äôm assuming it would be about 60% at 25 feet)",True
@R3vokenDallout1on,2020-10-01T17:10:48Z,0,Most players are starting to shoot deeper threes anyway so I don't think moving the line back a foot and a half will do that much. I could be wrong tho.,True
@MildlyAmusingComedyC,2020-09-29T02:33:50Z,0,As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines. I think cutting out that corner 3 would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes.,True
@r.forrestblount9222,2020-02-06T21:01:18Z,1,"Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.   The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix.",True

@isaactrussell5121,2019-09-23T05:25:24Z,1,"Love the analysis, thought it was super interesting! Thought of another question as I am working toward switch fields to data science. What types of things would you want to see on a resume/CV with no formal data science background besides data science projects, and github?",True
@WingfanSports,2019-09-23T02:05:18Z,1,Love this video and this kind of content.  I can imagine that if the line was moved back to 25 feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect.  Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out.  Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further.  I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this.  I for one like how the NBA is played right now but am always fascinated by major changes and how teams adapt.,True
@benjaminchen4367,2019-09-21T23:35:20Z,3,That Steph graph was kinda surprising,True
@a1rbagj.344,2019-09-21T23:18:42Z,1,"Wow, is this a coincidence? I just talked with one of my group members about 4 pointers in Big3 league and other stuff relating to sports data analysis this afternoon. Just as I arrived at home a couple mins ago, I turned on my computer and saw this fresh new video which talks about NBA 3-point line. So I immediately commented before watching.",True
