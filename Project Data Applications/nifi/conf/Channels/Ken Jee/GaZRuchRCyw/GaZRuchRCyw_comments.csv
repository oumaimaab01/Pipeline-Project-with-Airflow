@Mutual_Information,2022-08-04T19:01:11Z,5,"Nice to see PyCharm represented. It does indeed get a bad rap for the slow indexing, but that aside, it supports a ton of functionality that I can’t live without these days. Maybe I’m just stubborn.. but I’m still team PyCharm.  Also, this was a cool video idea - interesting hearing a collection of in-the-field data scientists and engineers.",True
