I am currently an Analyst at a FinTech company and have a solid Maths background but not so much in technical knowledge. I would love to get more experience in Data Science as this is actually one of my dreams but I find it really hard to find the time when you have a 9to5. What you do is really inspiring by the way, was wondering if you had any videos about your career? Do you have a full time job as well or doing youtube full time?",True
