I am concern about my communication difficulties in meetings and undergo presentations but however in the UK unfortunately there are shortage of Sign Language Interpreter (SLI). It be good idea to set up meetings early something like 8.00 am or late after 5.00 pm because that when SLI are usually available. I like to know how often do regular Data Scientist need to attend meeting during the day, how long and is it everyday? I understand being a typical software engineer for example that the meeting are normally 1/2 an hour meeting per day.",True
