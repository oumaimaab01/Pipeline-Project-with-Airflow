Reminds me of some of those movies that came out after the 2008 crisis that (admittedly) dramatized the situation, but gave a pretty clear explanation of what happened.

@daniel_tobi,2022-02-24T18:39:39Z,2,"It a starting ground for other organizations adopting ML, there should be a check in reality, inflation and others affecting factors could cause a change in actually results even when the ML says otherwise.",True
@jeffnogo,2022-02-24T17:45:05Z,1,"For such complex estimates, with many shifting variables that an automated model can't so reliably account for, there is going to be some error.  That's fine, and Zillow knew this, but I believe the main issue here is that it wasn't a completely closed system.  So, even if on average their estimate was correct, the seller still had to agree to sell the house.  So, on average, when Zillow made a judgment that someone was underestimating the value of their house, I'd say it was more likely that these were the bad houses with unaccounted for problems and the model was overestimating the value.  These people were much more likely to agree for Zillow to buy their house, while in the case where Zillow's model was underestimating a house's value, the seller would almost always turn down the offer.",True
@timothyhinkle2963,2022-02-24T14:23:44Z,2,"It seems like this operates on rather poor assumption. However they tuned their model you can guarantee people who sell their houses to Zillow are not going to be representative to the market.  Also what's mind blowing is they bought a bunch of homes in Texas, which is a non disclosure state meaning no one knows what a house actually sold for. The error bars on that model would be huge.",True

@daveandrew589,2021-12-11T02:43:03Z,12,"By building an instant offer system, they provided a great incentive for people who knew that their properties were not worth the offer to exploit the system.

Scenario 2: Zillow's offer is 10% ABOVE true market value.  90% of people in scenario 1 are going to reject Zillow's offer, while 90% of people in Scenario 2 will accept. The problem doesn't lie in the ML model, the problem lies in the strategy. The further out of Zillows favor the estimate is, the more likely the seller is to accept and vice versa.  I'd wager that if they monitored flips from sellers that rejected their offer,  they would have profited (had their offer been accepted).",True

@dinoscheidt,2021-12-06T07:33:45Z,1,"My first rule of ML Engineering is that you need to spend a lot of time on two sides of Feature Engineering: The input side that creates your state, and the output side that needs to accept it to create that future state. If they would have spend more time in estimating not just the prior stage in the value chain but also the next stage, they might not have ended up in this situation. I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be. This way you could get expert input from crucial parts of the value chain in front of you, ride the value chain instead of trying to compete with it. In empirical science people often underestimate the impact of qualitative data compared to quantitative data. And that is exactly what happened here.  My 2ct.",True

@stevencunden7977,2021-12-04T20:05:59Z,4,"Hi Ken - can you clarify why you said that an optimal algorithm should always underestimate the price?

@kiranmenon3044,2021-12-03T13:42:25Z,11,"Hey Ken, thanks for touching on some issues which were glaring a problem.  But just to emphasis, flipping a property  to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a ""good"" choice, as current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house.  You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE !  but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble. So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply.  ""Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. ""  As you said in the section ""What is the zestimate really ?""  they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the ""negotiation"" is downed.  Thank you for this video Ken, because I'm an aspiring ML engineer and trying to become a Data Scientist; however I want to use these skills into actual business and this video has given me an insight...  How to succeed in a business using ML/DL as tools that compliments my other skills.  Maybe become a real-estate developer who has Data Science and ML skills and not just a General ML or DS pro.
