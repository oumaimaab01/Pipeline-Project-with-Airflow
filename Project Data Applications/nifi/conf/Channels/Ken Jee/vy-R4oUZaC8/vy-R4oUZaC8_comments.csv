@Der_Harbinger,2020-03-28T18:02:23Z,1,Thanks for this video! I hope you could make more videos like this. It could be helpful also for you to understand it more. Thank you so much!,True
@Mario-ox5dm,2020-03-26T19:53:29Z,2,Hey Ken!   This definitely is a great tutorial but I'm also a beginner as well just like the others.   Could you possibly do some simple beginner projects from start to finish using the Spyder IDE ?   Definitely have the time on my hands now due to the corona virus and i feel that would be a big help to me and the other beginners out there !,True

@LewiUberg,2020-03-20T22:09:59Z,7,"I absolutely love this!! Finally something specific to learn from. Do more do more. Have you ever tried the intel Movidius neural compete stick btw? And another question. Are you skilled with NoSQL? I just had a term paper using Cassandra, MongoDB and Neo4j. I got an 89% on it. I could almost cry. I put everything into that. Used 3x the time estimation. I might actually complain about the grade. But I have the same professor In 3 courses next year, it might not be smart. Anyway! Keep doing ones like this. They will get me trough the courses :)",True
@importdata95,2020-03-20T19:26:01Z,2,"Very interesting video Ken. Thanks a lot!!   One question regarding Google Colab though. Do you use the TPU setup or the GPU setup? I've been told that TPU performance is a lot better than GPU's and I was curious what you actually use?   Also, I recently got into Work From Home setup and it seems to me that you have a very minimalist-style setup where you can focus on your work efficiently. Would you be willing to share your setup if you don't mind in your future video?  Hoping you are staying safe as well!",True

Do you think it‚Äôs the same probability of getting a job but I just have to work harder and be better? Like same probability, higher standards",True
