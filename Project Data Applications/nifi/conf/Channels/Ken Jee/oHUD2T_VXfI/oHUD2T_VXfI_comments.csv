@ananguyen5497,2022-03-02T01:55:44Z,1,"Hi ken, after creating a project, how do we put that on our resume? Do we just add the link or put a section for projects and just summarize the project on the resume?",True

@souvikganguly9948,2020-09-12T18:25:03Z,1,"Hey Ken,  I have been working as a Mainframe developer with 3+ years experience. I have been quite well with Python as well. Right now, I have enrolled myself in a DataScience MS course and trying to build my github and kaggle profile. I have made an account in Medium and started blogging as well. But I have never made a website(except using blogger and wordpress). Just wanted to know about your thoughts on having a personal website. Thanks :)",True
@metinalisho446,2020-09-10T06:57:06Z,1,"I agree, this is a very neat and tidy repo, very compact and well documented. Only critism I have is that when I comes to using github in the real world the developer/data scientist will need a good understanding of working with development, staging and production branches which is not demonstrated here. In addition, when it comes to deploying models through cloud services such as aws it is more secure to have everything in its own repo",True

@DataProfessor,2020-09-01T13:58:16Z,3,"Thanks Ken for another great video! I agree with you Ken, Darwin's GitHub is very well structured folder-wise, content-wise and format-wise.

@guilhermearaujo5868,2020-09-01T11:58:50Z,1,"Hey Ken, I've a question. Since I saw your video where you built a project from scratch and I discovered pd.apply(), I feel that I've been abusing it. I've read more about the function and sometimes another implementations are faster. When do you decided to not use pd.apply() and use other methods?",True

When describing ones skills with ML on the resume, is it better to name specific models, or more general techniques? i.e Skills: Machine Learning (linear regression, svm, PCA, etc...) vs. Skills: Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction etc..). Thanks for all the videos you put out, and thanks for reading!",True

I also browsed it and got very surprised : https://github.com/darwin-a .It's good to know that he got his first job in DS 3 months ago. My portfolio is also a bit different, because I recorded some videos of the last 4 projects.",True

@mattbarrett1560,2020-08-31T18:59:48Z,1,I feel that incorporating good questions into videos would be good. That way people dont ask the same question over and over again. Also good questions wont get lost as videos get older.,True
@ibraheemelansari7793,2020-08-31T17:50:26Z,3,"Hi ken, do you think a github portfolio is better than a personal website that contains all your information and projects ? Or should I do both. Thank you",True
@larigiba,2020-08-31T17:46:13Z,5,"Wow, I actually haven't seen this one repo - multiple projects folders approach so far; that's a pretty neat idea! Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos! Speaking of questions: Here's one: So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give ""something back"", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced?   Oh and I'm excited for the 66 days of data science! :)  Personally I'll probably go for 66 days of machine learning engineering haha",True
@t.t.cooperphd5389,2020-08-31T17:40:10Z,1,Take one question and a 2-5 minute segment on it would be cool at the end of the video. Even throw in an example. Cheers!,True

@lauramortura1310,2020-08-31T16:11:19Z,1,"Hello Ken! I want to thank you for all the great videos you provide that really help us, the ones that are interested in entering the field of data science. I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like 4 projects: using regression, classification, clustering, and DL or NLP. My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is? That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do?   Thank you!",True
