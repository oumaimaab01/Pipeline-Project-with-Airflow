I have also done  programming at the initial stage of my career and had been working in the ICT area. Recently I have acquired knowledge of ML with Python.

I have worked in the Middle East and India and in the UK for only 1 year after MBA.  I am a very fast learner . Can anyone help me in getting data scientist or analyst or business analyst job anywhere in the world? I know my age maybe a negative point but then I have vast experience of working in different business area.,True
