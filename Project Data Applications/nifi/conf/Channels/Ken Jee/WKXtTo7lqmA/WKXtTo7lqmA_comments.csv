I ended up following you down your queries for fun and noticed that when I went to save my view, I got this error.  ""Column names in each view or function must be unique. Column name 'playerID' in view or function 'WinningPitchers' is specified more than once.""  I found that curious since that's just from when we quoted out our join.",True

@crystalzhangy89,2020-05-10T21:56:01Z,1,"Hi Ken, thanks for your sql tutorial video, which is very helpful and inspiring!. I have a question in regards to subquery you mentioned in the video.    select bat.*, pitch.* from dbo.Batting as bat inner join (select * from dbo.Pitching where W>=10) as pitch on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID where AB>=40 instead of using subquery in inner join, I use normal inner join and put W>=10 in where clause, which came out the same result:   select bat.*,pitch from dbo.Batting as bat inner join dbo.Pitching as pitch on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID where Ab>=40 and W>=10;   my question is:  when should we use subquery? it looks complicated and easy to make a mistake during usage.",True
