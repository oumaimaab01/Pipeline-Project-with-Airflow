@Alex-zw3iv,2022-01-22T18:03:03Z,1,"Hello Ken, do you think it's possible to become a data scientist without university? And what would you suggest to improve my math/stats knowledge? Maybe something even recognized around? I'm a full stack java/js developer right now trying to move to data science (i've learn python, sql, etc) but i see strict requirements around, even for ultra junior positions. Thanks",True
@bumscholar6274,2022-01-22T13:13:43Z,1,"Interesting! Will check the post to know more. It's always so nice and refreshing to see a nonbiased and critical video on web3. Another trendy word right now is the ""Metaverse"", would love to hear your thoughts on that. Thank you!",True
@awds121,2022-01-20T15:37:18Z,1,"Hey Ken! Great introductory video! Thanks :) i have been doing small projects involving blockchain. For example, I scrape blockchain data but i do it using beautifulsoup and selenium. There are APIs but most are not well documented and are not free. When you said ‚Äúnew tools‚Äù to work with blockchain data, what do you mean? Also, if you are looking for projects, i would love to brainstorm with you and come up with ideas. I am already working on one and would be great to discuss it with you :)",True
@litorizer,2022-01-20T12:39:10Z,1,"Hey Ken! I would love to hear opinion from you regarding your graduate program at DePaul. Do you think it is a good program for someone without formal CS background? I studied Quantitative Economics as undergrad without programming experience, except statistical programs like eViews, Stata and SPSS. I am currently doing internship at Fortune 200 company as Data Analyst where I will craft my Data Modelling, Analysis and Visualization skills using ( Power) Excel, PowerBI, SQL, Python Spark, matplotlib, pandas etc.",True

@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-01-17T17:06:41Z,7,"Great video. Interesting that we sort of agree on the whole thing. Ive been stressing this for a while. The true way to make money in AI (especially in the Web 3 context) is through Data. People often think of big models and fancy architectures in Machine Learning, but that's not the major component",True

@Thuvu5,2022-01-17T15:51:14Z,2,"Loved your analysis of web 3, Ken! I've also recently researched a bit about blockchain for my CS study. Totally agreed, a lot of loose ends on the web 3 discussion that still needs to be solved before it can become mainstream.",True
@jakobtimmermann8075,2022-01-17T15:36:19Z,1,Nice perspective. As a computational chemist applying ML methods I'm always highly suspicious about people being too excited about any new methodology. And even though I am a retail investor in crypto projects I just can't imagine most narratives to come true.,True

@santoshbhattarai2527,2022-01-17T13:49:38Z,1,"What I am confused on Data Science and AI with the development of web 3 is, if the data are publicly available- I guess (more like believe) the owner of the data would be kept anonymous. Although there is plenty of data out in the web, how would the business make strategies to reach to their audiences/customers? Wouldn't it be like television/radio/newspaper ads?  Also, how would the services reach to their probable new customers/audiences? Basically how would AI work for recommendation and how would business collect data to grow their business?  I don't think the recommendation system would be like throwing anything to the public what they want people to see (not what people want to see.). Facebook and Youtube are not hurt.",True

@averysmith,2022-01-17T13:06:21Z,2,"Secret web 3 project with?!? What!!!!! That sounds exciting. But seriously, every transaction being publicly available is a pretty cool idea, but also kinda scary. Think about your credit card bill being public. üò©",True
