@DataProfessor,2021-07-21T15:50:10Z,6,"ðŸ¤” Yeah, have always wondered about that, thanks for demystifying this for us Ken! Thinking out loud, I can imagine that by chance a random selection may select songs by the same artist or from the same era and as you've mentioned Spotify probably imposes a filter for the aforementioned which makes it less random.",True
@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2021-07-21T14:45:30Z,3,How interesting ! I can see how the algorithm would prevent a succession of songs by the same person. Although personally I have a personal playlist that I occasionally edit.,True

I alway felt the shuffle algorithm on my IPod nano was better than Spotify's algo. I would hear repeated shuffled songs throughout a one to two hour time span on my Spotify playlist that has 1,500 songs. I wish they could fix that.",True
