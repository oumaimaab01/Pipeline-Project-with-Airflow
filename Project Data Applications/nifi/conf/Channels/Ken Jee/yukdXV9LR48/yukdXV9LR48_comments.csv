@astaconteazamaiputin,2021-01-09T15:07:54Z,4,"Thank yoy for the very informative videos. I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one's work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job.  So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part.   But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you'll keep postponing it.   Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future. There won't be a 'right' time.",True

I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me.  My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",True

I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close).    In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve?    Thank you for all your videos!",True

@bibislyvie1339,2020-03-24T23:08:28Z,2,"You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning(feature engineering, clustering, regression etc). In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection,  Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills.
