I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought.   Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be.  Anyways,  after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience.   My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it?  Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience?    I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that.
