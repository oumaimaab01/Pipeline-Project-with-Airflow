@piyushzope10,2021-03-25T19:45:35Z,3,"Hey, Ken. Thank you for sharing your journey and experience. It is really helpful for me. I have a couple of questions.  As you used to play Gold and Baseball and you have more knowledge about Basketball. I am a guy who played mostly Cricket from my childhood and some sports which I sometimes play and watch are badminton, hockey, car, and bike racing.  So Which is a better choice for a person like me. Should I try to apply my skills in games like baseball or Basketball or is it better to go ahead with the games which I played till now?  Would you like to share your thought on this topic? Which sports should one choose while entering into sports analytics?",True

I’m 19 and am beginning my journey towards my career in data science/sports analytics and your content has by far been the best I’ve come across. I was wondering if there was an email that I could contact you with? Or would you prefer Lengthy YouTube comments instead? Either way, thanks again for the free content it’s very appreciated.",True
@franciscolemos1674,2020-05-06T23:14:52Z,1,"Hello there, I have a question. I know next to nothing about maths but are you taking in consideration the fact that Shaq has two separate shots or free-throws, while Steph only has one shot? Let's think about a coin toss example, the probability to land heads twice is equal to 1/2*1/2=1/4, so let's say Shaq has a 50% success rate at shooting freethrows wouldn't it be 0.25*2 his expected buckets?",True
@TheDataMaestro,2020-04-25T12:13:21Z,1,"Fascinating. I could listen to this for hours. Had no idea analytics was involved in recruiting. Would love to hear more about how you might help a team develop strategies on how to beat a specific opponent. I appreciate what you sent me on LinkedIn a month or so ago, but I'm very behind on my reading.  George Musick",True
