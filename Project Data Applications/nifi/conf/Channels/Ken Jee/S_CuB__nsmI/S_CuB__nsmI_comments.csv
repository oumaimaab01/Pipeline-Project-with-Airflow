@whaat-ve1vt,2020-08-12T22:10:27Z,1,"Im confused of what i want to study.  Im good at math , physics, and chemistry which makes it harder for me to choose. I already know that i want to do something with STEM. My options till now are data science, computer science , mechanical engineering and chemical engineering. I have learned the basics of python till now but dont know how to go further.",True
@hamzamuhammadkhan,2020-08-12T21:19:27Z,1,Great !! Thanks ken !!,True

@ByWayOfDeception,2020-08-12T20:07:27Z,1,An interesting conversation today.  It occurred to me that on job fair and recruiter sites you often don't see a separate category for 'data science.'  This is despite so many firms looking for folks with that specialty.  It tells me there is a lot of room to run in this field.  Very encouraging.,True
@SebastianMantey,2020-08-12T19:35:28Z,2,"Hi, Ken! Great interview!  At 49:42, you mentioned something that I found really interesting. Namely, that there might be a potential divide of data science jobs in the future. Do you happen to know any other sources (blog posts, YouTube videos etc.) that talk about that idea in more detail?",True
@DataProfessor,2020-08-12T16:03:58Z,3,"At first, I thought Twitch was only for gamers, I was wrong, it is also a great platform for data science! Truly innovative and great value Nick is bringing to the community üòÉüëçüëç",True
