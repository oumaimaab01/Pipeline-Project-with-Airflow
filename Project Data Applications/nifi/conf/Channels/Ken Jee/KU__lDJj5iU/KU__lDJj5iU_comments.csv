You can find more datasets from other states at a link in my data set description, we are gathering efforts in making public health data acessible.  if you're interested in working with the dataset, remember to set "" encoding = 'ISO-8859-2' "" in the pd.read_csv function to adequate to our latin encoding. that was a big obstacle I would have never come across if I didn't start on this project  currently struggling with making pandas function as I want it to",True
