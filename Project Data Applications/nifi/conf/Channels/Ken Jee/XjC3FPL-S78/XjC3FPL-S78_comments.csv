@piyushthakur2386,2021-03-21T19:04:31Z,1,"Hi Ken, It took me 1 year to learn to fully solve a rubix cube. For whole one year I was able to solve the 2 layers only, Finally I decided that I need to finish the cube and learn 3rd layer as well. Within a week I learned to whole cube. My personal best is 2 minutes 34 seconds now. But thats not the point. Point is now I am a hotel management student, with MBA in finance from Third tier institute, It is great deal in learning programming and stats , but that cube give me strength that I can. Sooner or later I will figure out everything and become expert. Thanks Ken Jee for inventing #66daysofdata to keep ourselves stick to the plan and get going.",True

Instead, I've taken a real interest in data science, more specifically machine learning, and have starting taking some courses online! I plan on doing a data science bootcamp later, which looks promising from the research I've done. My plan is extremely raw, but I hope to combine machine learning and psychology for the benefit of therapy and other aspects of the human mind!

Time series and customer analytics are much easier to understand. The final five modules are basically implementation and are mainly ML. How should i advance? like learning more advanced ML and DL?

@jeffreyugochukwu1942,2020-06-12T21:13:03Z,0,"This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science. This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem, there are many different ways to approach it. Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something. I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here, I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects. I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials. Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work, the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey.

@ilyaginsburg1888,2020-06-12T18:12:58Z,29,"I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*. When you go for one of the countless ""become a data scientist in 10 hours"" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone: 1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form. 2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks. 3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts).  All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid. I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now, though I've read the books, of course :)",True

@studyeffectivelymathengine3855,2020-06-12T16:59:54Z,0,"Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science.  When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about ""selection"", one of the key steps to learning. In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms.¬† Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages.¬†  How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica.  I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines.   Just sharing with you this crazy ideas ;-) Ciao!",True

I'm try to understand and practice each individual part of the whole process of building a project first and then in the end everything manages to piece together perfectly after that. I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since 2009, so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult.
