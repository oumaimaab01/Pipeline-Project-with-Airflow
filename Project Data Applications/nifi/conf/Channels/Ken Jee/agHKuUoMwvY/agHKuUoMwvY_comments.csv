With your detailed unedited video, I gained a lot of confidence. I used to get overwhelmed with so many terms but seeing you I understood that not everyone knows everything.

@seanstills1755,2020-05-20T16:22:47Z,1,Great Series Ken! Very informative and easy to comprehend from a novices perspective. One question I do have and forgive me if I am not understanding this project correctly but how do we use this tool practically? We are able to scrap the listings from glass door and ultimately make a model to estimate an avg salary for a job but when it is all finished is this a tool where we can plug in a job title and a set of skills or something and it returns an average estimated salary for said job (for maybe salary negotiations of a current position etc.)? Sorry if this went over my head when going over the project!  Keep up the good work and I will continue to follow along! Sean,True
