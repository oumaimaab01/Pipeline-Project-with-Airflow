@KenJee_ds,2020-08-07T16:39:12Z,30,"Thanks for watching everyone! To clear things up, the work of mine was copied in an article that was published on a blogging website that you can make money off of. If someone simply has this in their repo, that is not as big of an issue, but it should be cited there if they are applying for jobs. Plagiarism is a serious issue in data science. Hopefully this could help clear things up!",True

@florijnterstal6590,2020-08-09T16:38:14Z,1,Plagiarism can't exist in the IT world. If you have a dataset and you need get some data out of it.. there are maybe 25 solutions. Even if people don't know each other they can have the same solution and or have the same way of writing code. In the past i had idea. Didn't talk about it or publish it. I was working on it and about 2 years later(was not done yet) a big company came with the same thing.. I have tried to prove that i came with the idea first. But it didn't held up in court.,True

Let's say I did a project without knowing someone else on the net did something similar to my projects, is it plagiarism ?  2.

@studyeffectivelymathengine3855,2020-08-08T08:48:55Z,1,"Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this.  The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect.  If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is.  The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized?   The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence? Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort.  I recently had a quarrel with another guy who said, ""You can wipe your axx with the Ethics. In youtube world this makes no sense."" Welcome to the 21th century guys.",True

Doesn't make it right, though I agree with you that I doubt it typically comes from ill intentions.  On an unrelated note.... I think it's ""sy-kit learn"", not ""sick it learn"".

Would they rather you go through and write it out fully yourself, which would've substantially increased the length of that project. And of course, you knew it well enough to modify it.

@marknewton7170,2020-08-07T17:57:54Z,1,While I think it is an important conversation I should point out that most of what you described is not plagiarism.

@Actanonverba01,2020-08-07T17:06:44Z,2,"Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall. I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be.  My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say 'many' enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault.",True
@larigiba,2020-08-07T16:41:34Z,1,"This is a very important topic, I agree! As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general, however it is important to credit the people correctly. Some people may think ""I could have written that code myself"", which can of course be true in some situations, but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature. If you use a normal sentence such as ""the weather was nice"" obviously you don't need to quote anyone. But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source. Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in tech than it is in literature. Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear!  Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!",True

@jaigaurav5638,2020-08-07T15:39:29Z,1,"Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis?  Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful. Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much ""me"" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the ""life"" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist. Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I'll be really glad if you respond.
