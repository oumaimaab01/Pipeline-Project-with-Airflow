@ianmarshall4263,2020-12-06T01:26:25Z,3,In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!),True

Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio, I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship, landing an entry level data analyst role, or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased.  It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry  level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio. I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut. There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end.",True

The diploma is  two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates  to fill those gaps.  Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams.

Should I get Master degree in Data Science now to become a Data Scientist? or self learning along with various certificates and bootcamp and other online material is enough. In my engineering, I have learned almost mathematics you have mentioned one of your video.",True
@MohamedAli-dx2fp,2020-04-13T23:42:44Z,3,"I'm doing economics and statistics degree and I'm already self taught software developer. I'm good at Python too.  My question is, if I teach myself data science,is the this econ stat degree going to help me in the job requirements or they just need data science cert? And is it possible the math  taught in my class ( Calculus1 &2,statistics and linear algebra)  may cover for the maths required for data science or I need to learn more maths? Thanksüôè",True
@BeautyByJuliette14,2020-03-18T18:28:09Z,1,What about getting a bachelors in data science? Should I do anything after it or go for jobs right away?,True
@nathaniellanier6674,2020-01-29T16:39:29Z,0,Thank you so much for putting this content out.  It's an invaluable resource for someone like myself who is in the process of applying to grad school.  I was wondering if you think the pros and cons of a masters degree outlined in the video would apply to a masters in statistics as well?  I'm currently working in a completely unrelated field and I'm applying to mostly stats programs but a few data science as well.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.,True
@AndrewAlarcon17,2020-01-18T21:12:57Z,0,"Hi Ken, thanks for another insightful video! I have my BA in applied mathematics, and have been studying programming and machine learning in python for 6+ months now. I prefer self studying over schooling because I feel  like I learn best that way. One problem I'm currently facing is that a lot of entry level and internship level Data Science/Analyst job postings require either a PHD or a Masters degree. Should I keep putting my focus on my coding projects for my online profile for employers to see?",True
@abhishek-shrm,2020-01-18T20:49:41Z,2,"Hello Ken, I love your videos. I have a question. How I can know if I am ready for applying to internships or not? I have done few online courses on data science and worked on some projects during the course but still I have low confidence which always stops me from applying to internships.",True

@importdata95,2020-01-18T04:14:08Z,0,"As an undergraduate data science major, I've worried about not being able to land a data science position immediately after graduation. A lot of companies still seem to require a masters degree or at least 2-5+ yrs of experience for data science roles. I wanna carefully anticipate that these requirements would change within a couple of years to where undergraduate students are welcomed to apply, as I believe data science field is growing rapidly!",True
@ZubzSaidThat,2020-01-18T04:07:30Z,1,Can you talk about how you got your experience into data science and what you think about people coming from a Data Analyst role,True
