@anthonymoubarak8216,2021-02-04T15:45:14Z,1,"Hi Ken, I have 2 small questions regarding my data science journey. I am at the intermediate level in Data Science and have done a couple of projects and have become quite comfortable tackling beginner/intermediate problems, however I feel that my coding skills are very limited to DS, do you think I should learn new skills (ex; web development), or do you think sticking to DS related coding is enough to get me into the industry? My second question is how deep into the math behind the ML algorithms should I go and understand, especially when it comes to more complicated models (and deep learning models). If my goal is to become a business oriented data scientist (and maybe a sports analyst), Is a basic understanding of the math behind models enough ? Thanks for all the hard work",True
