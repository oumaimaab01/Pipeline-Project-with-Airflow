@shuaibahmed6031,2020-03-27T19:31:21Z,7,"Good book suggestion and the time to publicise its values. I finished Young's book at the end of last year, and it really helped me be a more attentive learner. I utilised a Trello board to track down the list of resources - following the meta-learning principle. Fully agree with you on the other parts as well like directness and feedback. I found that to be the keystone habit for me in last few months, as I always regurgitate information to the point where I can explain concepts like JOINs/LEFT JOINs without having to refer repeatedly to other resources.  Thanks Ken!",True

I am learning because I want a job in data science, but not exclusively in biostatistics. I also prefer Python over R. My question is: should I enroll in another course that is Python based and focus on that for a more generalized approach or should I just stick with the Hopkins course? Thank you!",True
