@mohammedkayser,2023-03-11T17:20:13Z,0,I want this website layout to make my data science portfolio  How can I?,True
@simranthiara8233,2021-07-14T18:32:02Z,1,"Is LaTex commonly used to write up a data science paper? If not, what software do practicing data scientists use? MS Word?",True
@spazhatter,2020-12-31T02:28:58Z,1,Thank you Ken for the detailed overview! I was wondering how Alexander embedded his project into the webpage? I saw your video on creating a Github Pages portfolio (led by Chanin the Data Professor) and I thought the way he integrated his project there is quite cool.,True
@bluesdog88,2020-10-08T05:32:31Z,0,Is Alexander picking his nose in his profile picture? lol,True
@larigiba,2020-08-26T12:13:36Z,3,"Wow, he really does have a very impressive resume! The level of detail he put into his projects is just insane, especially for someone who even has a different background!  I think it would be great to see Tina and Danny review projects as well, that would probably give them more attention on this platform as well! ;)",True
@flawedlogic342,2020-08-26T05:47:53Z,1,"Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door.   The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor.   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from urllib.request import urlopen,Request import pandas as pd  import random import pickle    headers = {""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3""}    website = ""https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm""  for i in range(1):     req = Request(website, headers=headers)     page = urlopen(req)     soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')     for item in soup.select("".jobLink span""):         print(item.get_text())   Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page.",True

@Alex-fw9oq,2020-08-24T17:23:44Z,10,"Thank you Ken so much for the feedback! I love what you're doing out here on YouTube, and love the critical feedback! You are more than welcome to share any of my projects or anything else.  I hadn't actually touched my website, or much of GitHub, all summer because I have been working a few research projects with my university, among other things, so this is great motivation to get back over there and update everything! You have also inspired me to start sharing more of my work with the world!",True

@DataProfessor,2020-08-24T15:39:04Z,5,"Congrats Ken on the 80k! Alexander's portfolio website looks really nice and clean. The Trivago project looks amazing. It is very nicely structured and goes into great depth into the underlying math as well as summarizing the key findings in several data visualization plots. It almost looks like a research paper, perhaps it would be nice to format it as a research paper (Key sections: Abstract, Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results & Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgements, References) and upload to arXiv.org as a preprint, might even look good in the resume also ðŸ˜ƒ",True
@Algovibes,2020-08-24T15:36:46Z,1,Very nice! Employers will line up from now on ;-) Good luck Alexander!,True
@chriscarbajal9688,2020-08-24T15:33:43Z,2,Do you have a video on where to start on your data science journey. I have less than one year to graduate from university and Iâ€™m majoring in data analytics. My university just recently made the data science major so I wasnâ€™t able to declare it. I may just be overwhelmed... any help is appreciated!,True
@raeroxx1270,2020-08-24T15:29:48Z,1,"I learned python during the quarantine. I also want to make projects that got me into the data science field though I'm not familiar with ml concepts, I'm learning them. I want some project ideas that I could add to my resume. Right now I'm doing some beginners level project like Titanic survival and wine quality one. But I want projects that could get me jobs. Any idea where I can search for them?",True
@RougeSam,2020-08-24T15:16:33Z,10,Iâ€™ve been meaning to send you mine but Iâ€™m terrified of being roasted publicly,True
