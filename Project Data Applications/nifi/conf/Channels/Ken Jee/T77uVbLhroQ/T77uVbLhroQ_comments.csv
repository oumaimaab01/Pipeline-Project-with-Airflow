@kathrynmiller8651,2021-09-24T01:37:07Z,1,"Hello, I am in my junior year of a data science degree but I have not had any projects. The internship application period has just started but the only experience I have to show is what I have done for school work. Some queries, some R, tableau and excel. Should I include these to showcase my skills even if they aren't necessarily projects?",True

@piyushzope10,2021-05-09T07:26:48Z,3,"A helpful video for me. It will help me to bring positive and necessary changes in my journey of learning data science.  My learning- Explaining the WHY is really important which shows the purpose of doing something. Company-specific preparation is important while sending a resume and cover letter.  Ken, correct me if I am wrong but do you think you worked as a consultant in the past which is helping you to be a good communicator or explainer?",True
@salikmalik7631,2021-05-08T19:07:45Z,1,"Awesome video Ken, which regression  project is best to do for resume/portfolio?",True
@skyblue4230,2021-03-28T18:11:38Z,1,Thanks for sharing these awesome tips! I was wondering what kind of working positions would be helpful to have when applying to a data science internship. I'm hoping to go to a university that has a co-op program that begins first year but I'm most likely not going to get a data science position that early. Do you have any recommendations for what kind of positions I should look for that would be helpful for ending up in data science?,True
@WeirdAwkwardWoman,2021-03-22T18:59:23Z,1,Thanks for the information,True

@devendraadhikari6441,2021-01-20T20:34:06Z,1,Hey Ken!! Thanks for this great video. I am in a dilemma. I am doing my undergrads (2nd year) on Computer Science and I am really interested in data Science. I have started my journey towards it and almost there to do my own projects (Started doing projects on Kaggle). I have work placement on 3rd year. By then I hope to have some projects done on my own. But I doubt companies hire an undergrad for data science role. I have heard that they prefer master's student. What's your say in this? I don't want to change my career path now.,True
@TheMightyOprah,2021-01-10T21:55:54Z,5,"Hey Ken! I have a question. For internship applications, how complex do the portfolio projects on my resume need to be? For example, there are some datasets (like Kaggle's Titanic) in which I could create a pretty accurate regression model in just a few lines of code, but that obviously doesn't seem like enough to include in a portfolio. Further, if I'm taking an online machine learning course, and there are 'projects' given but solutions to those projects given as well, I'm assuming that those projects wouldn't be wise to include in a portfolio?",True
@hrishikeshmanjunath8518,2020-12-31T12:13:31Z,8,You make things sound less overwhelming while also being real about putting in the work. Thank you for the positive energy brother!,True

@jameshizon4861,2020-11-26T04:58:17Z,1,"I have a hard dilemma, where I graduated while having a data analyst internship but wished I did a data scientist internship on top of it during college. I am guessing that my best route should be to land a data analyst role and then work my way up to a data scientist position as I gain more domain and real world experience working with data/working on more projects added on my portfolio?",True
@bolasamer8898,2020-11-10T23:09:49Z,1,do companies in the US or Europe hire remote data scientists or analysts from outside the country to work remotely or that role is exclusive for local people and must be in the workplace?,True
@bianchialex,2020-10-04T00:46:30Z,2,When you bring up projects I understand the concept of what a project is but how do I do a project as an undergrad. Should I lookup some project or think more creatively and do something unique?,True
@tanyk333,2020-08-15T04:38:21Z,1,"Hi Ken, I am taking online course on data scientist currently, with a institute known as Simplilearn. Not yet complete the whole course, but I am having preliminary exposure on data science using Python and R. Thinking to apply a data science internship to accumulate my working experience. Do you think it is a good time to apply for internship?",True

@kailandec.6722,2020-06-26T03:23:50Z,5,"This was so helpful. My background is in biology and cognitive science/psychology and throughout undergrad I've been using Python and R to run a variety of different analyses for hypotheses, research questions and data insights. Most of these don't have a ML component, I'm learning that now. could these projects still be relevant for landing a data science internship?",True
@overratedisoverrated930,2020-06-01T02:20:05Z,1,I truly feel ashamed while typing this text but what do you literally mean saying project? I mean for instance I think an original idea and then collect relatively data from sources then create a model for prediction. Or I just choose a Kaggle Project and try to accomplish the aim as good as I can. Which one does count for a resume? THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THOUGHTS BTW ‚ù§Ô∏è greetings from Turkey,True
