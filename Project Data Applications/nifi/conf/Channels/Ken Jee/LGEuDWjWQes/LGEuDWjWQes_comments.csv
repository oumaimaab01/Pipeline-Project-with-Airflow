I love making these videos, and I hope that you are finding them interesting and useful. This analysis and the growth of my channel would not be possible without you watching. Thank you again for staying tuned!",True
@kevidgutierrez7375,2021-03-12T07:25:55Z,1,Nice video! maybe you could do this analysis every semester and show us the highlights to celebrate! I think it would be great for new years eve jaja. Greetings from Peru!,True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-02-23T17:53:54Z,1,"#45: Wonderful insights, it's great following you along with all this. I saw your 45 videos till today, and I think the sweet spot in the length of the videos is 12 min and is nice that all videos are specific and clear (Nothing with data here :) just my personal point of view ) Thank you for sharing the code, for me has been a good way to understand some of the blurry concepts in my mind!!! #66daysofdata",True
@arthurmiller5276,2021-02-17T18:36:50Z,1,"Interesting analysis!   Another factor to consider is the content of the videos themselves. Your videos cover various topics like data science as a study / career path, project demos (like this one), and work / life suggestions. So, is there a coloration between the content of the videos (factoring in some of the other influences) and the response metrics?   And while you are taking into consideration which days you post videos, have you considered simply posting on a particular day routinely? Lastly, are you LOSING subscribers and are there any suggestions, if this is occurring, as why this is happening?   Keep up the good work!! Looking forward to a follow-up video (if I just haven't gotten to it yet).",True
@YingcredibleTips,2021-01-28T18:35:27Z,1,"Solid analysis! I wanted to do a similar video like this but don't have enough data to work with yet. Thanks for the tips on post time, I wonder if posting on Monday is unique to your channel or it applies to other channels as well?",True
@themanzo7542,2020-12-11T12:35:14Z,2,"Great, that's really data science brought lively and friendly. Am inspired, and am glad too the channel is growing well",True
@waitesdennis,2020-08-03T16:02:04Z,2,I was thinking as the video went on that you should do another video. It's been almost a year and a comparison would be pretty good. But if you did it live? Then we'd get to see how you would apply data analysis to your YouTube channel. I bet you'd have some really good numbers to report on with pretty steady growth :),True
@TechnicalGuruji_Satish,2020-05-28T11:01:58Z,2,please make a video on best projects to attract recruiters post covid 19,True
@DataProfessor,2020-05-12T14:39:26Z,3,"Thanks Ken for an insightful video! LIked your analysis, particularly your results on posting consistently led to increased viewership and watch time where Days of Posts & Days After Posts had  2-5 times higher viewership and 2-3 times higher watch time.",True
@asmrparadomir,2020-05-09T23:32:02Z,1,"Hi Keen, I really enjoy your videos, do you think is a good idea to start the first project making one model of linear multiple regression or it should be a bit more complicated? Thank you",True
@vupham5252,2020-02-18T16:54:59Z,0,Interesting video! I'm a Junior Undergrad majoring in CS and I love Data Science videos like yours! Thanks!,True
@planetnicky11,2019-11-12T17:16:24Z,1,Nice job Ken Boss! So sick to see your own analysis on the youtube data. Well done!,True
@aryandeore7566,2019-11-12T05:51:06Z,0,Please do a follow-up video explaining the effects(+ve or -ve) of you findings on your channel( did your channel actually grow ),True
