@Wagner-uv6yp,2023-08-30T07:35:40Z,3,These AI tools are some of the best teaching resources ever created. It makes you wonder in the probably not-so-distant future whether it could just outright replace the knowledge jobs that we humans do.,True

@lightonkalumba,2023-06-26T21:56:20Z,2,Exactly üíØ I use ai to do my data visualizations. I only know matplotlib but I leverage ai to change the code using a matplotlib library to plotly!,True
@armorkinggaming1933,2023-06-19T14:43:06Z,1,"Data Science hiring has slowed down. The demand is pretty low. It's not because of layoffs, many people might argue on this. The demand for data engineers is good but it's not same with  data science. What are your thoughts on this, the hiring slowdown for data science only @Ken Jee?",True
@mouryarj,2023-06-15T12:40:19Z,2,"Hey Ken! So I am about to complete my undergraduate in computer science, I have adequate knowledge in python and it's libraries and also a good idea on MySQL. I have decided to pick up a specialization for my masters. I'm confused on which one to take. The idea of analyzing and predicting data really intrigues me but however I'm not that great at math overall. But I can do well in statistics though. Do you think it's worth picking up Data Science or should I lean more into Artificial Intelligence as a whole?  Also, I really love your videos and how you keep updating roadmaps constantly as times keep changing. Really appreciate your efforts!",True
@anonymous20yroldmale92,2023-06-14T00:22:27Z,1,"For the features you talk about in chat gpt, are some of those part of the paid version of it? Thanks (I am someone who uses the free thing or version of it).",True
@saaanniiii,2023-05-25T20:51:21Z,1,"Hey Ken, just to let you know I'm a beginner in this field and just like a kid I was looking for how to start on type videos. Fortunately I found you and you made total sense to me regarding everything. Looking forward to follow you more on this journey and also by reading comments of other people I can deduce you are a good guide and very soon I'll find it out too ;)",True
@williamguesdon400,2023-05-18T10:26:09Z,1,"Thanks for your insights, Ken. Fascinating to see how ChatGPT will influence the fields of Data Science and Bioinformatics. The tool saves a lot of time when coding or summarising text. You also need good domain knowledge to identify when the model hallucinates. ChatGPT often invents functions; you need domain knowledge to sort the good from the bad. I wonder how these models will evolve when more and more online content is generated by them.",True
@khitabsingh364,2023-05-17T17:49:49Z,1,Try writing drag and drop case. It suck at it now.,True
@vintagejonny3524,2023-05-15T22:17:21Z,1,Awesome video Ken! I was surprised that data sets can be fed to chat GBT as I thought it only takes text as an input. How can I do this??,True
@saurabhpal7053,2023-05-14T09:42:06Z,1,Hi Ken! Will you suggest me to transition my career into Data analytics/science despite the impact of AI. Will it be safe job for 10 to 15 years down the line???  Please answer....?????????‚ù§,True

@KMKPhysics3,2023-05-08T17:22:31Z,6,"Hi Ken, awesome video as always! I'm finishing my PhD in Physics next month and planning to leave academia to go into data science. I've found your videos on these topics incredibly insightful. I've been using ChatGPT to start doing some fun side data science projects and learn more about Machine Learning (took a course in it like ~4 years ago, so very rusty on the topics), and it has been incredibly helpful as a knowledgeable assistant. For someone with coding experience in Python but maybe not expert developer level, ChatGPT is so good at getting one started at learning how to use new packages and tools that are outside of one's current knowledge base. I know several friends who are also planning on leaving academia and trying to break into data analysis/data scientist roles, so I will be recommending them to your channel!",True
@keylanoslokj1806,2023-05-08T16:17:31Z,0,What certificate is good for eastern Europe beginners in Data Analytics?,True
@criztina,2023-05-07T17:36:22Z,1,Great video! Is creating code a premium feature? I have the free subscription and chatgpt told me it couldn't create code,True
@bin4ry_d3struct0r,2023-05-06T09:41:22Z,1,Someone with no DS/ML knowledge wouldn't know if ChatGPT makes a mistake and how to fix it. A data scientist would.,True
@CodeAriyo,2023-05-06T08:39:24Z,3,"‚Äã Thank you Ken for this video. I signed onto your course on Udemy about ""How to Start a Career in Data Science 2023"". Great content.   You and @DataNash are definitely my guide because I'm new to this from a very different field and it feels overwhelming what I have to learn to be able to even get an interview in the UK.",True

@Mutual_Information,2023-05-05T06:27:59Z,18,"On point! I was totally surprised with people's reaction that this AI explosion would make data science *less* relevant, due to automation. At this time, massive amounts of money are getting poured into machine learning. So my reaction was the opposite. And since using ChatGPT and having some familiar with their scaling laws, I don't see DS getting abstracted away. You said it better than I could üëå",True
@hasibalam9992,2023-05-04T18:27:17Z,1,Thank you so much for the video . I had the same questions and your answer was really good. Thank you so much for this,True

@Rawi888,2023-05-04T16:42:54Z,2,"Hey Ken. You're one of my biggest inspirations by far. No really, you got me to read David Goggins' book, same with Dr Sinclair and others (keep those recommendations coming).  I have a request, I totally like this series of ""If I could start over"" but could you add like... some more philosophical emphasis on why ?  Just imagine for a second a total loser who cannot take anything much less himself seriously for a long enough time frame.  How would that person go about taking proper accountability for their learning especially in these turbulent times ?  Like.... this hypothetical loser (totally not me, I win so much) can't take college too seriously but wants to learn anyways, they need a direction and purpose.  How might you transform that person  ?  My questions :  What are concepts and hard lessons you WISHED you could have learned earlier ? What are your proven methods of success ? What would be your guide/map that you could hand to a younger self  to escape the so called ""matrix"".  From finances, emotional management, opportunity cost. EVERYTHING !  ""The portal is closing, we don't have much time kid. QUICK ! Take this, and stay the course"" type of information ?  Thank you for taking your time.  I appreciate all the hardwork.",True
@yalmerquiroz6444,2023-05-04T15:42:38Z,10,This was very helpful! I re-started my data analyst learning recently and feel a bit lost of where begin again. Currently studying python and sql. I'll be sure to check your other vids out as well. Thanks again,True
@6Mar99,2023-05-04T15:27:03Z,4,"I just finished my google data analytics professional certification. As someone who only has knowledge in data through excel, chatgpt was very helpful in my studies. I find SQL and R were the most challenging parts of the course, but chatgpt was able to make it easier for me to digest by asking it how the functions and syntax relates to excel and break the topics down into a lot more digestable chunks. I'm currently using GPT4 to expound my ideas into feasible projects to add to my portfolio.   I would also like to add that you have no idea how your videos were super helpful in my data learning journey. Thank you so much Ken!",True
@Rawi888,2023-05-04T15:22:23Z,3,Your gains bro. You looking crazzzy. Good job. Great video as well.,True
@danicasimic8264,2023-05-04T15:20:11Z,1,"I love your approach, but I still feel like beginners should be cautious, AI tools are still not the most reliable, and like you said, they tend to hallucinate. Love the video though!",True
@barisbayar84,2023-05-04T15:08:30Z,1,Your perspective and approach is very good as always. Thank you.,True
