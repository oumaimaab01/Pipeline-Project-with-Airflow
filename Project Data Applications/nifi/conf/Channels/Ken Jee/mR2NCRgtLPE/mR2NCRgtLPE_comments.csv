@apa9031,2020-06-02T06:22:14Z,2,"Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man  I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer  There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective  I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such  Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music  But what i asked is much bigger than that  I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design  However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance?  Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours.  When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project.  Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet.   Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position.   Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you",True

@craveright,2020-06-01T18:58:28Z,1,"Ken, I really enjoy seeing the Project Review episodes. Wondering if you saw my email which I sent to kenjee.ds@gmail. I sent it on 5/26 and it would be coming from royal sasan. Thanks again for this wonderful channel!!",True
@komet133,2020-06-01T17:17:47Z,25,"Thanks Ken for reviewing my project, this will help me a lot. Some wrote, that I'm not a beginner, but it´s true. I started coding for the first time, with the beginning of the pandemic in March. I enjoyed it and also I had nothing else to do in the lockdown, so I invested whole days in learning Python/Data Science; Watched a lot of tutorials with 2.5x speed. Ken´s project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project. The result you can see in this video. But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point. So, it´s a nice compliment, when someone thinks, that my project can´t be from a beginner.  Also, I hope this motivates people, who are now at the beginning.",True
@chelseablues5137,2020-06-01T16:43:12Z,1,"Hey, Ken, I’m a newbie in DS field and just getting started with my studying. Which online platform would u recommend to start from? What r ur thoughts on Dataquest?",True
@azamatatabayev6420,2020-06-01T15:44:40Z,1,"Hey, Ken, I'm new to the data science, so I wanted to ask you a question. A lot of people say that the most important thing that data scientist should make is ""value"". However, I saw a lot of popular notebooks on Kaggle with complex algorithms but without any explanation of the reasoning behind them (e.g. doing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews but without mentioning why it might be beneficial). So my question is ""Is explaining the reasons behind your actions and mentioning the value of your work important?""",True
