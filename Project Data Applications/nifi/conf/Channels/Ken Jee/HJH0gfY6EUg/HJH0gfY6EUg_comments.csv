@hornfan722,2020-07-24T13:51:22Z,1,Why did so many ppl dislike this? Going through projects step by step pointing out the nuance is helping me A LOT,True
@hornfan722,2020-07-24T13:45:11Z,1,"Wooow- just diving into this video but what a great series idea. (Endless content created by others, who are willing participants)   the coding virus has spread and isn’t stopping— as more people dive in; videos in this series and your channel by extension, will explode  All of this is miles above my head but I’m slowly getting it",True
@tuonglukas7109,2020-06-12T09:07:05Z,0,"Hi @Ken Jee, thank you so much for your videos, it helps me a lot to navigate what I need to do to improve my portfolio.  Would you mind giving me a little bit more information about this? I generally put my analysis writing on my Medium.com and code on Github. Then I connected the two together because I got those Medium.com articles that got featured on TowardsDataScience. Plus, Medium.com generally provides a much better layout for my project analysis. Do you think that approach is much better compared to just publish the analysis on Github? Looking to hearing from you soon",True

@stefanghiban,2020-05-31T19:41:16Z,1,"Hi! I am not sure what the project was about after doing EDA.  Did he try to predict the actual true gdp by using only the most relevant features in the data, like the number of phones etc? Sorry if this is a dumb question.",True

@LewiUberg,2020-05-28T21:25:34Z,2,"Hi Ken! Im currently working on my first regression analysis (first concrete data science project really), but I’m being pretty thorough. Would you like to review it? It’s an assessment for my stats class, but most of what I do is not required since we have more concrete data science classes next year. It is due in Sunday, so if you are interested I can provide it for you. Just keep in mind it’s a first for me :)",True
@larigiba,2020-05-28T13:07:54Z,2,"Awesome, as always! I found this one particularly interesting, because it was well documented and went rather in depth. It shows that you can always do something to spice up your projects. On a different note, how many hours do you actually work to create one video? It is really incredible how you've kept up with consistent uploads for over a year and I am just curious about how much time this takes for you.",True
@fatmaabdallah1112,2020-05-28T12:28:54Z,1,"Thanks ken:) your videos are just great, l'm planning to become a data analytic, any recommendations for specific channels and courses please ,, cause I just feel I'm lost.",True
@tarunj,2020-05-28T05:23:02Z,1,"so I just started learning about data science, your videos help me a lot to get the insights. Thanks for those, and I had a question that would you recommend me to do the IBM Specialization on data science as a beginner?",True
@mattmatt245,2020-05-27T22:05:03Z,1,Is this possible to apply a custom loss function in a regression model ? I'm working on a stock market prediction model and I need to maximize the following loss function: if [predicted] < [actual]  then [predicted] else [-actual]. Would that be possible ? Thanks,True
@anthonymoubarak8216,2020-05-27T19:34:06Z,1,"Hey Ken i got an idea for a project to work on my own (i posted it on the comment section of the video prior to that one, but just in case you only check comments of your most recent video), can i send an elaborated version of my idea via email so you can have a quick look and give me a little bit of insight ? Thanks",True
@Mario-ox5dm,2020-05-27T15:12:59Z,3,Loved the part where you mentioned how him including small personal details on his GitHub such as how he likes Chess can have such an influential factor on people looking at his profile!  Will definitely reference this video again in the future :),True

@ethanr2012,2020-05-25T23:14:47Z,1,"Hi Ken, great video. I’m going to be getting my masters in business analytics starting in the fall and am trying to work on some projects this summer to get some more experience. My goal is to work as a data analyst for a couple of years and then transition into data science. Your channel is very informative for understanding this field and how to leverage Kaggle and github because my current experience level is just MIS/analytics undergrad and internships. It’s really helpful to hear about these topics from someone with experience that isn’t a professor. Keep up the great work!",True
@DatascienceConcepts,2020-05-25T23:05:15Z,3,Ken Jee your content is awesome! I feel you really did a great job covering some of the important aspects. I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for some time and what really helped me get a lot of interviews was my research experience in ML  and DS.,True

@snorlaxahilan,2020-05-25T18:01:34Z,2,"Hi Ken, I've been doing a data science bootcamp in London with Flatiron School. This week is my final week, and I have just finished my final capstone project. I plan on applying for data science jobs very soon, and I am trying to sort out my github projects, so I can impress recruiters and companies I apply to. I plan on changing my older projects to be structured and detailed like my capstone project, and do the same for any new projects. Could you review my capstone project please? This is the github link to my capstone project: https://github.com/awesomeahi95/Hotel_Review_NLP . Thanks, been loving your videos, very helpful!",True

@DataProfessor,2020-05-25T15:03:36Z,3,"Liking this Review series!  Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included).",True
@ImportData1,2020-05-25T13:21:26Z,17,I'm tying to get better at explaining and documenting my work so this is a great example for future reference! Thank you for sharing it!,True
