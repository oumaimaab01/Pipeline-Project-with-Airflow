@brendali5803,2020-09-26T08:01:00Z,1,"Hi Ken,  Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and  taking challenges. My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming... Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile.",True

I jave a question, in your opinion how long it takes to become a good data scientist or data analyst for someone who is good in statistics and using excel, beginner in programming, knows  the basics of sql, python and tableau",True
@mikro272,2020-09-18T16:51:23Z,2,"I want to ask you a question and ƒ± hope you will answer. I am willing to be a data scientist. After 3 years, ƒ± can have a job because i am in a college right now and student of statistics and computer science program. And my question is; will data science job die until i get the job or data science will die in the future?",True
