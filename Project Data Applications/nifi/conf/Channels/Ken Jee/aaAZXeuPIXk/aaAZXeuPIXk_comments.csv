For the linear regression, the R-Square was ~.02. Thanks for watching and remember to comment with your thoughts on this scandal! -Ken",True
@piyushzope10,2021-03-20T13:30:55Z,3,"I actually watched the baseball games to understand the game... How it works, how points system works and many other things...  I also replicated the code into spyder and need to study the code more and need to understand it  I also watched Astros game and I think they used signs to manipulate the shots... I still understand the whole matter but these things should not happen because it reduces the interest of people...",True
@gregjacobs110680,2020-05-17T18:06:57Z,1,"Ken,   Very cool analysis.  I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts.  I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average.  If that is the case, then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways - strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers, especially in high leverage late-game situations.   Really looking forward to part two.  Baseball analytics is a particular favorite of mine!",True
@joetropolis,2020-03-12T06:02:06Z,1,How did I miss this upload? Keep up the good work.,True
@KeenanKelsey,2020-03-03T15:16:34Z,1,another good analysis would be a batters Hitting average home vs away. There's theory that some teams were doing the same thing for home games. The batters with a much greater batting average at home vs away can be telling.,True
@alanchirino1397,2020-02-26T07:13:58Z,0,How high level of coding do you use?,True
@KenJee_ds,2020-02-24T15:16:24Z,3,I actually just found out that the by inning / at bat data exists! I will hopefully be adding a part 2 to this video with that analysis!,True
@TheDataMaestro,2020-02-24T14:24:15Z,0,"Ken - Any data by individual batter? How do we know if the stolen sign was correct? Since a batter only has a second or so to react to a pitch thrown, what if some batters might do better if they didn't believe they knew the sign and, therefore, might overthink the at bat? So far, you won't be able to answer these questions. However, can you split the sample by runners on base vs no runners on base? (btw, I still need to respond to the info you sent regarding 2 point conversion. Thx for that!)",True
