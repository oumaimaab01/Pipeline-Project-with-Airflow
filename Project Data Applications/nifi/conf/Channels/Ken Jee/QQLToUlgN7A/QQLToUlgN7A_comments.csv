First, the session expires pretty quickly, and you should fall to the shameless tricks to keep it.

@Derael,2020-07-10T19:54:15Z,0,"I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5.  What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless.  The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches.  Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.  Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort?  Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower.  My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations.  For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice.  For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects.  For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good.  For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences.  For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice.  Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do.  Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available.  As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C.  Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we.  Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks.",True
