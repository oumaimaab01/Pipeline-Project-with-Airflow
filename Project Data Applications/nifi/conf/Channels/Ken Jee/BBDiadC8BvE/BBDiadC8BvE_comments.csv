For deploying machine learning models, what cloud service is most used in the industry? Obviously it depends on the model and the use case but I'm having a hard time figuring out what cloud service to use.   I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it?
