@lucrieffel5018,2020-06-18T03:28:11Z,3,"Hey Ken, I am a really big fan of all of your content and you have truly inspired me to enter the field of data science and sports analytics. I am an incoming college freshman (math major)and I have been learning SQL and python through code academy. Other than projects, do you have any tips to make myself stand out in order to get an internship? I hope to intern with the Los Angeles Lakers analytics team and I could really use some advice. Your videos and website(playing numbers) are the most helpful resources related to the field that I have been able to find, keep up the great work!",True

@larigiba,2020-05-02T06:26:06Z,5,"Great video! Generally I think the younger someone is (or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education) the more impressive extraordinary projects become. If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst  collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year. Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible. With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more, especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today they are probably more of a requirement than an add-on. Nevertheless, great video! I really hope to land an awesome internship myself in the coming year(s).",True

At 2:04, you mentioned that ""if you want to set yourself apart, you should consider doing unique projects on the dataset you personally collected."" Are there any efficient ways I can collect new dataset?",True
