@ahmadbilal3568,2023-09-03T10:34:48Z,0,"I remember in 2018, i was working on one my project and i need GPUss for that. My Prof. bought me HASEE Kingbook laptop (So very nice of him) but the problem was that, despite my earnest effort i couldnt install Ubuntu on it because of hardware incompatibility. It tried many means to overcome that like using VM etc. but i couldnt, as they dont support GPUs. If they had released WSL2 at that time, a lot of my problems would have been solved. ALASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS..........  Still KUDOS to Microsoft to be lenient about their UNIX systems policy and start developing such amazing tools.",True
@megasuperlexa2,2023-06-16T05:59:13Z,0,does it work via Windows VPN? is it fast accessing Windows files?,True
@paherbst524,2023-05-19T14:56:06Z,1,My general setup is to run Linux on bare metal and windows in a VM. One thing WSL 2 offers is the ability to share the gpu. that's a pretty big win. I wish there was a way to do the same with Linux as the host OS,True

@vladislav148,2021-12-20T08:36:42Z,1,"I don't know what magic WSL2 uses, but it can consume up to 5.5 gigs of RAM of my 7 avaliable (1 gig is allocated to intergated GPU as VRAM). Can you even imagine launching virtual machine which can consume 80% with 1.5 gigs remained for host system?",True
@imamansoni,2021-12-19T07:53:34Z,1,"Wsl consumes so much ram, just open a  very small react app with vs-code running with wsl-remote-extension and it   uses 1.7 GB of ram. I have 8Gigs on my laptops and with running wsl it literally uses 85% of ram, and also got the BSOD multiple times. So Disappointed !",True

I think it's great for learning and practicing Linux commands in the terminal, which IMO is a core skill to have for data science.",True
@shrutijain1628,2021-12-17T17:26:05Z,2,This was my first time knowing about this but it really sounds interesting and something worth look intoðŸ’¯âœ¨,True
