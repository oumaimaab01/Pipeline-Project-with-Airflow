@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-06-27T13:24:17Z,124,"What I recommend to people is to go up to local businesses around you and become an ""unpaid intern"" of sorts developing projects for them. You set your own schedule and etc (just as you would with a personal project). At the end of the experience you get to say you worked with someone (so you get work experience+ LinkedIn optimization). It also exposes you to a ton of perpectives in the real world and the projects can be fitted to yout needs.",True
