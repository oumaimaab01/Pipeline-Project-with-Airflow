@a_vickyp8360,2021-03-15T15:28:49Z,1,"#60: Very interesting this one, I know you are focus on DS but this could be an overall reminder of what to ask when you are finding a job, the one I like the most was about the development opportunities are there within the company?  We must grow, remain the same doesn't help to our environment. #66daysofdata",True
@Grejegando,2021-01-20T17:24:05Z,2,"The last question could be understood as if you were fishing for feedback, hence might indicate lack of confidence or even a lack of understanding to the position you are interviewing for. After all, you have supposedly done your homework and established a strong link between your knowledge, set of skills and the open position, the company's vision, goals, etc. In other words, how would you add value to the company if you still do not understand how your skills and expertise align with their expectations? As an interviewer, I'd view that question in a negative light. But there are ways around it and you can still get that sort of feedback indirectly. Apart from that, great video and great tips from you as always. Keep it up.",True
