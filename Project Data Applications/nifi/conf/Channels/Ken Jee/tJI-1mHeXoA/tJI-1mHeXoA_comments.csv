@danielsilva3383,2021-02-21T22:20:43Z,1,"Hello!  I am a big fan of your channel and your content helps me learn data science and ML  I am a tennis player and I was thinking on how I could apply data analytics to my game. I did some research and I found a startup called SwingVision that analyses your game using AI.  I thought that I could do something similar mixing my passion of tennis and AI. I have been doing some research but I am not aware of any tool that allows me to do something similar to that. I found some research papers but they had too much math and they were too complex to build my app from that. Are you aware of some framework or any tool that allows me to do something like that? Or do you think that I need to make new algorithms? Also, do you have any tips on how to make it a profitable Saas?  Thank you, ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Daniel   P.S. If you know about potential applications of Data Science and Machine Learning on Marketing and Business please tell me. Happy to hear from you",True

@shrutijain1628,2021-02-19T16:47:03Z,1,quick question: after sometime if i want to change something will i have to redo the whole thing or the website will already have my portfolio so i just have to edit.? ps: Amazing name of news letter signing up right now .,True
@neversaynever166ify,2021-02-19T15:02:51Z,0,"Great video as always! Making a portfolio has been in my agenda for a couple of months now. I kept pushing it back cause in my head i wanted to code the whole thing from scratch - now I'm thinking, will that be worth it seeing how i can use platforms like wix instead..  but also, i don't have that much data science work to display (i'm a computer science graduate with a few ds courses and projects) so maybe making it from scratch will be another way to showoff my work in itself? It's gonna be way more work so I'm wondering now which option should I do :/",True

One of the many things I have trouble right now is doing what you explain in this video ... building a presence on the web. So, all you're saying in there, quite valuable. Also, it is giving the boost and motivation I need to start.",True
