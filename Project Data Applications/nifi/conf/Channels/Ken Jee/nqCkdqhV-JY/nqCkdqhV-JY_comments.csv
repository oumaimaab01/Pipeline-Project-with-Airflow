I read an article on ""the dark side of data science"" which said that learning learning data cleaning and the algorithms is just small a part of it. You also need to have data engineering skills, like Snowflake, AWS, Hadoop etc. Because in a real world project you need these too. Is it true? Thanks for your response!",True
