@monoarul_islam_3,2023-04-06T07:15:54Z,1,Thanks guys. Very informative video and inspiring as well.,True
@ButterBeanCW,2022-03-28T02:11:39Z,1,I’m getting my masters in Earth Systems science. Recently found a passion for the machine learning side of our field. Something I’m going to try and resist is the idea of further formal education and just teach myself what I need to know.,True
@NatashaMugwe,2022-01-11T11:44:41Z,1,"Great episode once again. My learnings is to create a journal to write down what you’re learning, how you did it and what next. And I’ll take it a step further and share it with the world. Thank you for sharing this conversation",True
@ac6852,2022-01-04T06:32:54Z,1,This was such a fun conversation to watch! Learned a lot. Thank you for this! Definitely following Daniel!,True
@jl2899,2021-12-07T17:31:29Z,6,Currently teaching myself python/sql/ML and this is 100% the best video i’ve come across. Incredibly inspiring. I feel a lot more motivated and feel a greater sense of clarity in terms of which direction I need to go and what approach/steps I need to take in order to move in that direction.   Appreciate you both and hope you have Daniel on again soon!  Fellow aussie from Sydney 🇦🇺,True

@piyushzope10,2021-02-11T18:14:09Z,3,"That is a very nice conversation... The points I like most are, 1. Trial and Error- try to do as many experiments as you can and reduce the time been them. 2. Rubberduck is the best one. 3. Three things- Smart, happy and useful. Also, things that might not work are used for learning. 4. Building skill, sharing work (Ken also say this very often as it is really essential.  Thank you to both of you...",True
@yuliakovalevska9216,2020-12-14T08:16:04Z,3,"Wow, that's so inspiring! I aspire to do that ML thing too, although I have no previous background in science or hardcore math. So, hearing about real humans doing stuff from scratch helps me to believe in myself. Thank you!",True
@KennTollens,2020-11-01T02:57:02Z,1,"You drove Uber on the weekends, and just studied ML all week long?",True

@donnelly5757,2020-07-31T01:09:48Z,1,"Realizing that my odds of establishing a lush career in the field of data science in my middle to upper 40s are at a probability of close to zero given my past employment history going all the way back to dropping out of high school, this video gives me hope that anything is possible with enough devotion, dedication , desire, and willpower!",True
@Neetish21,2020-07-26T08:45:53Z,0,"Wow, I'm amazed by this. Just completed the dog vision project in Daniel's course. Throughout the course I've dreamt to one day become as proficient as him. Turns out that he didn't know much about computers just four years ago.  I need to improve our find excuses than a non programming background now.",True

@nardsmath3511,2020-07-23T14:04:17Z,1,2 legends and both do BJJ,True
@felipeoyarce8288,2020-07-18T21:30:01Z,6,"I really enjoy both interviews! I remember back then in the end of 2018 when I decided to study ML by my own during my master in physics. Daniel's channel got my motivated, inspired and informed about the online courses out there. Today I work as a Data Scientist in an amazing company that produce plant-based foods trying to imitate animal products using artificial intelligence. I recently found your channel Ken, and it have very honest advices and great material to people that want to start in Data Science and also people in the industry already! Thanks to both of you guys!!! PD: Can you share the podcast with Elon Musk? :)",True
@spartancass,2020-07-18T14:18:52Z,3,"Very enlightening to hear from someone with Daniel's background. As a recent biomedical science graduate and nutrition/fitness obsessive, I identify with this story to an uncanny degree... Only difference is I eventually got into medicine and only now started with coding/machine learning!",True

@jalwerdt85,2020-07-17T13:35:10Z,3,"Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience. Oddly, learning data science has been more rewarding thus far, mostly because of being self-reliant on myself and becoming independent. Not having a syllabus and everything planned/laid out in front of you is a skill in itself. It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in. This means a lot to me as someone who was a first-gen student, and college isn't always attainable or even the right path. Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U.S. and also the globe. Thank you both for the informative interview. I will be journaling my progress at the end of the day... we all could use some confidence and motivation.",True
@elisapashku2827,2020-07-17T07:17:03Z,2,Super video. Super inspiring. Only wished that the background music was more calm. :(,True
@lucrieffel5018,2020-07-17T00:59:00Z,2,"Hey Ken, great video as always! I have been looking for a specific dataset where I can do a project using clustering and classification. I have been having trouble finding a good one on Kaggle and GitHub, do you have any specific datasets that you recommend  (beginner/intermediate level)? Thank you so much again for the content, your channel has been my main source of guidance on my data science journey, I couldn't do it without you!",True

@BrotoBhattacharjee,2020-07-16T09:52:38Z,3,"Thanks a lot Daniel & Ken for putting it together. I do have a question for both of you : How do you keep your concentration levels high when you are reading a book cover to cover ? It's a lot of stuff. I tend to lose my interest after reading a book for about 2-3 hours. At the end of the day, when I look back, I have just skimmed through the pages and I can recall maybe  1 or 2 topics at most.",True

@JK-xw5rn,2020-07-16T02:44:47Z,16,The Biggest Data Science Crossover to happen,True
@johnwig285,2020-07-16T02:17:08Z,16,"Honestly, if 1 out of 3 is gonna fail, then the system is the biggest problem. It just means the admissions team didnt do a good job filtering out those who lack a crucial background in bio, and the curriculum along with the support system lacks quality. A school with a good system would only see 5-10% drop out rate at most.",True
