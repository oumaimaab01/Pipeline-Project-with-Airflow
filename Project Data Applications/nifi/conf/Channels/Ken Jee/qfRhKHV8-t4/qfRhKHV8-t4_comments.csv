@lavanshuagrawal8367,2021-05-23T02:28:06Z,0,"Hi Ken, in this case, ETH High is predicted using other parameters. But, how could it be used to predict the future cases?  (Because in my understanding, we would still need to predict most of the other inputs used in the model. So, how would the prediction part of this model work?)",True

@sandk,2019-02-28T23:25:25Z,2,"The problem with these sort of codes is that you are predicting the past. It just follows the line of the past and can't make predictions for the future. So if you want to loose money, go a head and use this technique.",True
