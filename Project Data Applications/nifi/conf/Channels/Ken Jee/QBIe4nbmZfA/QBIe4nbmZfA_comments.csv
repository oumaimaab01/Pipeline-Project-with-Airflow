@sasha297603ha,2020-05-05T16:10:23Z,1,"I'm not sure about this, but I think you have to try to change scenes and sometimes have just daily stuff like making coffee or something. Because for me it's a little bit boring to always watch on talking pretty guy. Yeah, but your content is great, keep going <3.",True
@LewiUberg,2020-05-05T14:50:58Z,2,"Great stuff as usual! I hope you will do one I will make in the future :) Do you have any tips on data science forums? I have a great python forum, but its more towards web, dev, ets. But really helpful bunch :)",True

@larigiba,2020-05-04T18:20:55Z,1,I really like how you stress the important parts and flesh out the points with bits of practical explanation like you did with the resume layout or the documentation. This really is good advice and definitely a resource a lot of people who are not incredibly experienced in the field can benefit from. I don't have a lot more to say than just the fact that I enjoyed watching it and thank you for the helpful insights!,True

@DataProfessor,2020-05-04T15:18:04Z,2,"Ken, Great video and insights on preparing a strong resume! Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers, a well documented code/notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects. Speaking of making websites and hosting on GitHub, Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) is a great tool, it is a static site generator that automatically creates a website directly from markdown files and it could be hosted on the github.io. Best of all, there's a large selection of themes to select from. Personally, I use it to create our research group's website http://codes.bio/",True
@srengran4583,2020-05-04T15:07:27Z,0,Hi Ken. This video was very helpful. I would really appreciate the video idea you mentioned of how to build your own website on Github. I have one on Wix but I think having one on Github would be better. Thank you,True

If some specific one then how to choose which one. Thanks in advance.",True
