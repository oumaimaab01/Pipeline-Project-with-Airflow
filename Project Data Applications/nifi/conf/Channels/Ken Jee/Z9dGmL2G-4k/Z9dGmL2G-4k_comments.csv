@piyushzope10,2021-03-28T19:58:24Z,3,"Thank you Ken for the video this is really helpful and it works really cool... Excited to go ahead and explore more...  Just a quick update-   If your ctrl + alt is not working in spyder then use F9 or edit your settings. You can refer to this video- https://youtu.be/8r2gMyt8BS8   Also during plotting graphs if it shows this- Figures now render in the Plots pane by default. To make them also appear inline in the Console, uncheck ""Mute Inline Plotting"" under the Plots pane options menu.   Refer to this video- https://youtu.be/MNkJT-5g8fU",True

@mariorashad1859,2020-03-16T14:49:38Z,3,"Hello Ken!   I'm a beginner and need some help. Whenever I run code, on my ""Console 1/A"" window on the bottom right of the Spyder IDE it doesn't show the output of the code.   Instead it spits out:  runcell(0, 'file path location of current file code is being type in')    For example, if I type in a 7 like you did and try to run it . this is what I get for the output on the console.   ln [2]: runcell(0, 'C:/Users/James/.spyder-py3/temp.py')   How do I fix this so I can see the output of my code ? This is mainly annoying because I can't even see the first few rows of the dataframe when you called  .head() because this is the output I keep getting, help :(",True
