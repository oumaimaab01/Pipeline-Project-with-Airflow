I can explore it by using some commands like "".head(20)/.tail(20)/etc..."" and specifying the columns that I want to be shown, but it's kind of annoying and you may not find some variables that need to be cleaned by doing that.

Quick Question, sometimes I get the following error:  StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document  I think It may have something to do with my internet connection, because it happens randomly during the scraping process.

It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a  project (how you handle it as a whole) Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture.  I'm having a hard time...   I'm trying to get ready a data set (cleaning, inputing, binning, etc)... i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation/inputation/... Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions   What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers?  Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc)  to get my dataset ready? Or what am i supposed to do? Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling...  I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this...

As a suggestion the videos are a bit long it would be much better if you split them into like scraping data, data cleaning, etc. Hard to see some of the codes on big screen maybe consider using Jupyter Notebook or changing the font or background colour Thank you for your all hard work!",True
@shashanks2024,2020-05-25T18:45:40Z,1,Great series. I'm trying it out after looking at your video. I feel that the per hour salary is just for an hour. While you have replaced the per hour with a blank. Aren't we gonna convert the per hour to the actual salary. By googling I found out that a data scientist in the US works almost 60 hours. Shouldn't we multiply this with the per hour salary and then with 52?,True

I have a question regarding the data cleaning. In the video, you manually scrolled through the data to find odd values such as 'per hour', 'employer provided salary' etc. in the Salary Estimate column. But how would you find that kind of value when the data frame has hundreds of thousands or millions of rows? Is there any function or way to find those odd data without manually scrolling or searching?",True
