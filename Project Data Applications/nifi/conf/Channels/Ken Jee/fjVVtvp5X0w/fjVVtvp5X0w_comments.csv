You need to understand your customer and make sure that you are providing an analysis that is relevant to their end goals. If you are speaking to business stakeholders, they are usually focused on profit / loss, user experience, or other performance metrics. Make sure that you are tying the value of your work to these metrics that are important to them. Thanks again for watching!",True
@celebdaily7721,2021-06-09T11:55:28Z,1,Great content! I’d like to add to “getting the yes”. I think it’s just as important to get a ‘no’ or an objection early on that way you can discover info that would otherwise be a hidden roadblock further in the sales journey.,True
@piyushzope10,2021-02-24T16:59:26Z,3,"Ken, The technique mirroring is really effective. I am very much influenced by it till now in my life. I was unaware to it.   It may sound weird but I am trying to avoid watching movies and the content which is not relevant for my growth because it unknowingly makes a huge impact on my day-to-day routine. I am watching more videos of you and more data science videos so that I can cultivate those hobbies in my life.   This is really a great and best video for me.",True

Not easy to get, it's important to cultivate it. ⭐️👩🏻‍💻 I made a course on that topic and was really useful, not only to understand me as a ""seller"" also to understand the client and how to sell, all about personalities!! Great tips Ken! #66daysofdata.",True
