@AmeanAbdelfattah,2023-02-08T18:06:32Z,1,"Look for employers that want to bring in new skills not roles for the team. In my team we collectively have a variety of skills and knowledge, one of us know Oracle, another knows Snowflake, and another knows Application development. I am trying to be the guy that knows Azure. Together we have the skills required to accomplish our goals as Data Architects. In fact my job role isn't called Data Architect like the rest of my team is, its Analyst in Data Management which proves my point. But that doesn't stop my manager from going around and telling people I am a Data Architect.",True
