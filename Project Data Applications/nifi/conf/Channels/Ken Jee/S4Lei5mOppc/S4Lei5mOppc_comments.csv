@doomvur9969,2023-05-04T16:31:10Z,1,"My problem with learning something is that i'm a student in an uni, but the subjects that i learn are not correlate with something i'm chasing. I'm strongly interested in data science, because my mind works in a way that i process and analyse information and i see everything in my life as an information that i need to analyse, process, and make my decisions based on conclusions that i come to after analysing. But. In the uni, although it's connected to programming, and now i'm quite capable of learning anything, no matter how complex subject is, but i get stuck on a wall of why's and not finding answers. So as a result, i'm a mediocre student, that passes tests just to pass them and not having any problems with my university.   I now, that, if i'm interested, i get to be very submerged into what is interested to me. I was able to learn drawing, palying instrument, or learn to play sport games in quite a short time, but when it gets to learn something that i don't see as interesting to me, no matter how hard i would try, i understand that i will have to burn myself out in order to learn something that i just can't see useful for me anyhow in the future. And i try to find answers for how that would be useful for me, but i fail.   And now that i gave up on trying to become a good student, that knows things that won't really be useful to me, i want to focus on something that no matter of if i have a degree or not, i know that i will be able to play on the skills that i learn myself. So for now the main question for me is in building that study path, where i can get the necessary things that will pay off in the future. Like, where can i find topics for my personal projects, where can i get experience for what i myself really want to learn. Will the courses that i have on the internet really be useful for me in the future.   To conclude this, i found out that i'm not good at studying actively, but good at studying passively. Like, it's very easy for me to get burnout if my study is percieved for myself as something that i NEED to spend time, focus on that, isolate myself from other things for the particular amount of time. But. When i can ease myself from these walls that i build myself and if i can just implement Passive learning of something, for example, through simple videos like yours when i watch YouTube, just get to be on the flow with my pure curiosity of things, this exact interest, that gets me to deep no matter how down, is just building on itself and then i lose the track of time how many hours i spent just researching something that was just interesting for me, and i never got tired of that, and if not my biological needs, like, to eat, to sleep, i know that i could research something forever. So, that side of me i usually call a passive learning, where you don't get those walls in your mind, that you Have to focus, that you have to concentrate, that you have to put away all the distractions, and the interest of learning something is just comes to you on itself. And if i push myself to learn something, i WILL have to push myself against the immediate mind response, that this work will be monotonous and exhausting. It's a problem of learning for me, and as far as i understood through trying to fool myself, my mind, etc. is that everyone is finding it's own ways to learn things and builds it's own systems of how they can get to learn some sort of skills.",True

I am so happy that our stories are a bit alike. After graduating an elite high school some of my friends went to Oxford or big European capitals, while I went to a more peripheral university, where I briefly majored in I.T. and Psychology before finally switching to Business & Economics, but even that is (still) going very slowly because of struggles with motivation and lack of purpose. Statistics used to be black magic to me back when I took my first course. Then the second course likewise went easier, and I started to grow fond of the subject! I, too, have stopped thinking I am inherently bad at math. Thank you for giving me hope that I might yet make it!",True

@rubyherring,2021-11-30T08:54:40Z,1,"Thanks Ken! Lesson 7 on projects is probably the most valuable one. That article you displayed, ""this will make you understand how hard data science really is"", is trapped by that fallacy: you can only be really really good at something if you know all the stuff about it. That's a very academic mindset and I found that in the real world outside college, it's not what you know, it's how well you can solve problems (aka finish projects). You don't need to know things from the top of your head if you have learned how to find and process information fast. If I had known that in university I probably would've been a lot happier and relaxed about my future.",True
