@ashmansukhani3928,2023-07-13T18:16:58Z,1,"I have watched at least 5 to 6:00 training videos on the subject of ml and deep learning etc. And I will tell you that it has taken me four times as much effort to understand that s*** sorry to use a four letter words then to the value that I got out of it. Whereas your of comments and explanations and conceptual arm waving has given me so much so many answers that I wish I hadn't wasted so much time on the four or five of the training videos. I think you should be creating at least another 5 or 10 videos, similar videos and different topics or concepts of the whole machine learning and and and and and and related topics. I am so happy that I found you your presence and I'm so very grateful for the effort to putting in and I would be even more grateful to see more videos from you. Thank you so very much. Enjoy your day!",True

@johnflood6508,2022-01-21T05:36:38Z,1,"Hi Ken, as always, your videos are insightful and easy to follow. Would you say that  one of the main distinctions between a data analyst and a data scientist is that the analyst focuses on what happened? While the scientist is looking for future possible outcomes?

@saturdayboy,2022-01-18T22:16:57Z,1,"Wow, this video is brilliant. My only problem is that the title looks like a clickbait when it actually delivers what it promises haha. So much chatter around data science these days but very few voices really know the field and of those even fewer have the clarity and generosity to share it in approachable/useful videos like this. Congratulations for the quality of your work and a big thank you.",True
@zuxzux,2022-01-17T01:25:14Z,3,"I noticed in this video you mention the tools used for a Data Scientist but don't say too much about the math that's used regularly. This seems to be a common trend on ""How to Become a Data Scientist"" videos. They almost exclusively talk about learning Python, R, SQL etc. but rarely go into any detail on the math involved in the field. I'm in a masters program for Data Science and it's pretty heavily math focused to begin. Just an idea for a future video.   Anyway, thanks for consistently putting content out, you're videos have really helped me in understanding the direction I want to go!",True

@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-01-13T05:10:19Z,1,I think it's interesting that you differntiate Data Science from Statistics. I guess it's a matter of semantics but I've never heard someone else say that,True

One of the first examples of Data Science(though it was not called Data Science then) comes from John Snow‚Äôs famous map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Before germ theory was known, it was thought that Cholera was simply in the environment and that it spread at random. John Snow conducted interviews, mapped data points and graphed the results, leading to a single water pump being identified as the culprit. This was founding moment in Epidemiology and Public Health.  Just sharing my learnings as well. Cheers :D",True
