( I haven't done math in school since 2011). I     for sure feel like I'm in the seconds phase of learning. Should  I stop learning the python programming part and just focus more on the math part?",True
@shanygnedowney,2020-04-06T17:44:52Z,1,"your videos has the best timing, thank you for the useful tips, i`m currently at stage 2 and  using your tips to transition forward a big thanks Ken",True

I need help",True
@TheDataMaestro,2020-03-14T04:16:29Z,0,"Great video Ken!    Suggestion for a future video - ""Data Science and the Coronavirus""",True
@justinlam5565,2020-03-13T19:10:40Z,2,"As always, great video!   One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, ""learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math"" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.     It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:   Do you stay within that domain at work?   If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job? If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?   Thanks for the video Ken!",True
@alessio4265,2020-03-13T17:08:48Z,1,In your opinion is a statistics' degree useful to become a data scientist or is completely useless?,True

It’s like macro-patience and micro-results",True
