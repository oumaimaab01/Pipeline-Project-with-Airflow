@DataProfessor,2020-07-23T14:57:43Z,1,"Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast, really enjoyed the discussion. I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially. As a researcher, sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities. For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc.       As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc.       Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward. Imagine if we all share, the collective intelligence of all the awesome ideas and works would serve as amazing resource to learn, get inspired and create further awesome data science work. 😃",True
@akashsingh.3856,2020-07-23T10:48:01Z,1,"Sir, I have a confusion I want to ask which is better an online certification course on data science or a 3 year degree program?",True
@rajajivignan9897,2020-07-23T09:54:16Z,1,"Just a Quick question:  Should I (I'm from non-technical background) be doing competitive programming and algos in Hackerrank or Github to learn and excel in Data science?  Thanks, your videos are very helpful.",True
@arthurmlcc,2020-07-22T21:24:12Z,5,"I recently read something about digital footprints (don't remember where but there's a brazilian video that talks about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8yXWFRROg&t=479s). It talked about how anything you do or post online, maybe a github account, or a comment on stackoverflow, anything that can help the world see you, is efficient, the important thing is to do somehting.  Sooner or later, opportunities will come.  Great video Ken. A suggestion: I think it would be nice to talk about foreigners  trying to enter the data science market (in your case in the U.S.). How it's possible, advices, maybe stereotypes or if there is much prejudice. Think it's a nice subject.",True
@justinhuang8034,2020-07-22T19:33:50Z,1,👏👏👏🔥Great content like always. 🔥,True
@salonipriyani9800,2020-07-22T19:05:18Z,2,David Perell wrote about the concept of 'serendipity vehicle' in one of his blog posts where he explains the importance of sharing your work on the internet. It goes hand-in-hand with what you explained.   Great video!,True
@larigiba,2020-07-22T18:07:44Z,2,"This video hit really deep personally. I have been thinking for a few months now that I should show my work more. I though about starting a YouTube-channel or a blog, because I think it would be a lot of fun doing so. Especially when Eric said that everyone has a personal brand, and your choice is not if you want one or not, but if you want to actively take part in shaping your brand or not, this really made me reconsider the way I think about showing my work. I now feel even more motivated to start sharing my work more. Thank you for this video!",True
@ImportData1,2020-07-22T16:34:14Z,7,Sharing your work -> opens up more opportunities,True
@italomendez4400,2020-07-22T15:07:42Z,1,Hello Ken! It's amazing how your channel has been growing. I'm looking forward to expand my DS knowledge. Are there any books/text books you would recommend for learning Data Science? Thanks!,True
