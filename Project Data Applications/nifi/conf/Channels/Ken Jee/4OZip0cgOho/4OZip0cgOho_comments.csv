A lot of comm colleges I've looked at don't seem offer too many of these types of courses.  While most of them have Calc 1 - III, they seem to be lacking in other areas (like data structures and stats courses beyond elementary stats).  I realize they are only two year programs.  Any insight regarding which CCs might be offering a more Data Science specific majors at some point in the near future?  Would a comp sci program be of any use? I have been getting a lot out of working through some of these Kaggle projects.  Honestly, just looking through the comments, code, and how previous projects were built are extremely helpful.  (Your Titantic project example is certainly among them).   I apologize for bombarding you with these long-winded questions.  I do, however, greatly appreciate the insight you pump out via YouTube.   As difficult as this material can be, I do find your words and wisdom inspiring.  It's also nice to see occasional rays of light while sifting through all these reams of data, code, algorithms, and math.  It does spark ideas in my ""not-so-mathematically-inclined"" brain.

@LeftThumbBreak,2020-10-11T14:27:06Z,1,"Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects.   When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you.  That's exactly opposite of the real world.  You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data.  That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.  I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain.

@grantmurray6185,2020-06-15T16:57:16Z,1,"Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn: --------------- 1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins) --------------- 2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape. 2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library. --------------- 3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a  fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development --------------- 4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work. --------------- Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed:)",True

However, I'm still far from a data scientist. There's more about data engineering (getting the data ready) and deployment (platforms, UIs, APIs, servers, containerized, DevOps) that need to be included in my skillset. Your journey shows almost half the way towards data science.  This is for everyone: keep learning new tricks and practicing with real examples.",True

@amdenis,2020-06-06T18:28:57Z,8,"I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills.  HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach.     People who learn exclusive via doing‚Äî especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of.  Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches.   There are multiple factors underlying this problem.  First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference.  This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above.    The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they don‚Äôt know.  In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions.  While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches.  In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you don‚Äôt know how to optimally use even the tools you do have.  For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups‚Äî ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community.    So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education;  even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself.  The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years.  As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience.  The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity.  For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling.    This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI.  Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide.  As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training.    Sadly, many of us who don‚Äôt get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs.  So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier.  Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often don‚Äôt learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc,  So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development?   The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW.     Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.  So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives?  First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives.  First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.  For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift.  You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books‚Äî at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit.  Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas.  Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern‚Äî just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine.   And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative.  In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit‚Äî let alone intern/apprenticeship training.     Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge?   Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average‚Äî and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction.  So, don‚Äôt migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so.",True

@toddmoxley2018,2020-05-18T20:58:39Z,0,"I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this? Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R?",True

@mwredfern,2020-05-17T14:05:21Z,76,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We‚Äôre not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part.   2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, ‚Äúalmost no companies know what data science is‚Äù. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it‚Äôs the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That‚Äôs it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I‚Äôm telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming.   3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn‚Äôt say data scientist doesn‚Äôt mean your not going to do data science work. I‚Äôm a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE‚Äôs get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python.   My job title is NOT data scientist.   My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of ‚Äúmust know Python‚Äù, it‚Äôs a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don‚Äôt know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn‚Äôt tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in Python. Yet they‚Äôre interviewing candidates for Python development. üòÅ  If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills.   Good luck!",True

We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R.

I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes. Cheers",True

@AndrewAlarcon17,2020-05-08T14:12:08Z,10,"I discovered 365 Data Science by your recommendation at the start of this pandemic. Their videos are highly informative and involve very detailed projects that will help you understand key concepts, as well as open the door for you to start making your own types of projects through what you will have learned. So, I definitely recommend them as well.",True
@vladm.6859,2020-05-08T14:10:44Z,67,Goal is to learn the basis of ML in the next 6 months. I'm going to come back to this comment,True
@mohitnagarkoti4086,2020-05-08T13:57:56Z,1,"Hello Ken,  If you could you suggest the order in which a person should learn ML algorithms?   I would be very gratefull to you.  Thanks",True
@mihirshinde3131,2020-05-08T13:27:02Z,1,Very helpful... thankyou for dedicating your precious time to guide beginners like me.. :),True
@matheusleal7528,2020-05-08T13:11:04Z,1,"Hey Ken, just wanted to show some support to you. All your videos are super helpful and fun to watch. Keep up the good work! :)",True
@larigiba,2020-05-08T13:10:53Z,58,"That new intro of yours does look really cool, I have to say! :D I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years. Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next 5-10 years. My personal goal as a (now) first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers, more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do. Have a nice weekend :)",True

@LewiUberg,2020-05-08T13:08:31Z,16,I didn‚Äôt know about Kaggle micro courses. That will come in handy :) I have found that many people on Kaggle could have tough me a lot if they had documented their notebooks better. I learn a great amount by doing as much as possible from scratch at least once. Thanks for another good video :),True
