@IlovetheDodgers,2022-08-06T08:19:16Z,0,Ken - do I take my new Pythagorean expected win % and multiply times 162? Or - it’s Aug ‘22 and Dodgers have played 106 with 56 to go… do I apply Pythagorean % to 56 left and add to actual wins in first 106 in books?  Love your stuff,True

@UJu5GotOwn3d,2020-01-30T18:20:49Z,0,"I had to stop the video and try this out myself. I went back and found this clip in moneyball. Just ran all the numbers for the MLB 2019 season. This is wild! My hometown team the TB Rays with 769runs and 739 against with 84 projected wins ended up with 96. Got to win the close games! 2nd largest difference behind Chi White sox, who had a winning percentage despite having 708 for and 832 against. This is so cool and I really appreciate that you take the time to upload content like this!",True
