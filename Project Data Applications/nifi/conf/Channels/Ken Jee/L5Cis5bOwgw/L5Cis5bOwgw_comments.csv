@bin4ry_d3struct0r,2023-11-18T12:19:14Z,0,"I have some particular insight into SAS (Statistical Analysis System) software. My dad works as a business analyst contractor and have 20+ years of SAS experience. He pretty much now only accepts jobs that look for strong SAS proficiency because not many people have that. Thus, when he manages to land a contract, he tends to be very highly valued. On the other hand, such roles are harder and harder to come by because everyone now is switching over to Python.",True
