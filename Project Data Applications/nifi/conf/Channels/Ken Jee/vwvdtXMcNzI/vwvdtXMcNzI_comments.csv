I ended up getting a Data Engineer role with a local company and for a few months I thought I settled for less. But now, a year into the job, I realise how much better a Data Scientist I can be because of the Data Engineering skills that I have acquired here.   I was myself blinded by the hype around Data Science, not knowing that without serious Data Engineering skills (to extract, transform/clean, load and most importantly, to understand the journey of data), all the effort of fine tuning ML models could be nullified by the poor quality of data.",True

@YourMakingMeNervous,2021-11-26T15:56:24Z,9,"Based on my experience on the job market, Data Engineering is competitive right now, but it's easier to find a place that is willing to train you on it compared to Data Science. I was an analyst for almost 3 years doing a lot of programming and just got a job as a Data Engineer. I was upfront about my relative lack of experience but showed them all the ways I have worked on bridging that gap, and they are willing to train me. I don't think I could find a company willing to do the same for Data Scientist, those usually ask for Masters or PhD at this point.",True

Right now I'm working on a project that involves integrating data from multiple sources for other people to use, which is very similar to data engineering,  but my goal is to be on the data analysis side and I'm hoping that in the future projects around that will arise. With that being said do you thing that doing this kind of work will pay off in the future, or should I be doing data analysis and data science instead? P.S. I have less than 6 months experience in the field so far. Thanks!",True
@GuyThompsonFWTX,2021-11-26T13:22:55Z,1,"I‚Äôm fairly new to data engineering, but I‚Äôm beginning to notice that there are some segments in Data Engineering approaches to solutions - custom code, implementation of tools, and a hybrid approach each with their own pros and cons.  Custom code can be a good solution when there isn‚Äôt an out-of-the-box solution, the job is small, but this can take time.  Prebuilt tools can get problems solved quickly, but may lack some functionality/features and can be expensive.  The hybrid approach seems to be the most useful, but it takes a lot of knowledge to know how, where, and when to make these decisions for a business solution.",True
