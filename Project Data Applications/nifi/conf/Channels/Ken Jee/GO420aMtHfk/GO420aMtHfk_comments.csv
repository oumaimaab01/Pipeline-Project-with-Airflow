@IanWatts3519,2022-05-12T15:45:50Z,1,Just discovered your channel - love this series. I've yet to dive into Kaggle but I suspect that is my weekend sorted now (BTW - if you want to go deeper into Plotly check this channel out - this guy is amazing - https://www.youtube.com/c/CharmingData),True
@malebolegologela7267,2022-04-26T15:00:57Z,1,lol my guy @Ken Jee you are so tired at the end hahaha,True

@ruaridhggg,2021-02-20T16:30:16Z,1,Top content,True
@ramikhrais2189,2021-02-14T10:46:37Z,1,Thank you my friend for these insightful tutorials. Could you please recommend a link for dirty datasets that one can exercise cleaning on them?,True
@anuragsingh4766,2021-02-04T18:14:22Z,2,"Hi, ken,  Can you suggest to me how can I build my profile for a data science masters? What things should I do as I have one year with me? I will be a great help!",True
@alfienardyan4770,2021-01-21T17:55:45Z,1,I press like even i'm not finished watching this video👍,True
@grannystuna174,2021-01-20T20:32:18Z,0,"damn this is boring...no offense mate, I'm sure the learning is great, but I was interested in whta data scientists do, as I'm a just finish law degree and will probably go onto IP/ICT Law masters here in the UK, so was thinking if I could somehow mix it with data and become a data protection solicitor - mostly about GDPR and then the IP with it so like trademarks, copyrights, designs...but now seeing how boring data science is (even for a coder like myself), I wouldn't enjoy doing this. Prolly will switch back to international commercial law xD",True
@anelm.5127,2021-01-19T23:07:16Z,1,"This series is gold. Learned a lot ! Thank you for the effort. Hope you gain some new followers. This is what makes you stand out.  Please, keep on doing these kaggle series. I think this is way more helpful than simple tutorials of how svm works or why you should normalization yout data :). To see the analysis in a real scenario helps for sure.",True
@luisangel15,2021-01-19T21:47:00Z,1,These videos are awesome! Im sure u can sell them easily.,True
@surya-td4dg,2021-01-19T07:39:23Z,1,"Awsome Ken.... You really gave so much effort . Love it. Please at the end, could you make an extra video for github uploading as well ? Last time, I got lost on that step. Love it love it :)",True
@0megal2,2021-01-18T01:46:07Z,1,"I'm surprised that Data Scientists don't recommend SQL, while it's true that you need an analytic like the ones provided by Python or R, SQL is simple and almost as important.  PS: I didn't want to make a new comment, but I was afraid this opinion would get overlooked if I just edited the old one.",True
@selorm5188,2021-01-17T22:27:55Z,1,Plot.ly really nice demonstrating questions in the EDA part and presenting dataset constraints,True
@user-nw8we9ul5p,2021-01-17T05:58:56Z,1,I love this content,True
@imranullah7355,2021-01-17T03:17:21Z,1,Beginner projects needed please... Thank you,True

@0megal2,2021-01-16T20:17:18Z,3,"Like first, watch later -> rewatch when needed. Great video as always",True
@DataProfessor,2021-01-16T18:32:38Z,5,"Great video Ken! Nice and thorough analysis. 😆Towards the end of the video, the imbalanced gender classes is roughly 80/20, if we were to convert this to a classification model, would be interesting to apply undersampling or oversampling to create a balanced model that may potentially be used for model interpretation.",True
@satyakiray8588,2021-01-16T16:34:55Z,4,How come you are using linear models but did not scale the data? Or did I miss that? Also this gave me a ton of ideas. One would be definitely to do a feature selection after one hot encoding and see if the explained variance improves?,True
@armenhaddad1761,2021-01-16T15:56:18Z,4,been following this series since part 1 and i can safely say i have an idea of how to build and learn from kaggle projects,True
@ekaagustina9010,2021-01-16T14:26:34Z,14,Do more please especially for beginner,True
@RodStremel,2021-01-16T14:25:16Z,6,"that's awesome, Ken! I've never played with plotly before, but I might do it now after watching these project videos. thanks a lot for all the tips and tricks!",True
