@mwahmed9519,2020-08-13T11:28:42Z,1,Hi Ken. Your advices are really helpful and your work is praiseworthy. Just wondering if you could make a video on how to write a cover letter..Thanks..,True
@livinlifedayumn341,2020-07-20T01:27:45Z,5,"You’re a LEGEND Ken!! I only discovered your channel today and I am HOOKED! I started learning to code (in python) 2 weeks ago and am starting my first k-means clustering project with a dataset about penguins today!!

@mikecareyart2927,2020-07-14T23:22:50Z,1,"Helpful Tip for Adobe Illustrator (CS6 version is what I use but will still have it in other versions): They do have spell check.  You just click on the top menu bar ""Edit > Check Spelling"" or Ctrl+I for the shortcut.  Coming from an art background, I would still advise giving Adobe Illustrator another shot.  It takes a bit getting used to but you will always have more control with programs like this that are meant for better, professional design.  Great videos, love the content.",True
@arrhythmia125,2020-07-13T09:17:11Z,1,"Your videos are so informative! You brought up a lot of good points and it was nice to see Dos as well as Don'ts. I haven't watched many of your videos yet, but I am interested in your thoughts about how one gains ""domain knowledge"" as I have noticed it is not discussed often in online materials (but it is often mentioned in my MS data science program). If you already have a video about this, I will make sure to search further!  When I started my program, I was sure I wanted to work in marketing research (I have a BBA), but now I'm distracted by all of the shiny new concepts I can learn in school. Now, I'm considering a second master's and not sure if I should do computer science, software engineering or marketing research. Decisions, decisions, but 5 AM probably isn't the best time to be making life decisions.... 😂",True

@clintonlau8198,2020-07-08T15:11:51Z,1,"Hey Ken, super insightful video! I understand you should always show results in your work experiences, but how would you do that for data analytics/BI experiences e.g. designed dashboards, built charts, prepared reports, cleaned up data, ran ad-hoc data analysis, etc.  I have listed SQL (BigQuery) and working git,python and tableau knowledge in my skills section, currently facing problems in quantifying achievements, thanks in advance!",True
@hectorin863,2020-07-08T01:42:31Z,1,"Hi Ken, i have strong fundamentals on programming, and I can easily learn math , but i don´t know anything related to neither business things nor economics topics... is this mandatory to become a data scientist? And if so, do you know where can i learn it?",True

@mulle171,2020-07-07T19:48:51Z,1,"hey man, i know basic/intermediate programming in R/Pyhton so that i can introduce algorithms from libraries- like lm() in R-Studio. Right now i think the next best step would be to improve my programming skills since i study econometrics/statistics for the theoretical basis. What would be the best way to do that?  It would also be interesting to know if you as a full Data Scientist use libraries or if you just program the algorithms for yourself. Thanks in advance for an answer :)",True
