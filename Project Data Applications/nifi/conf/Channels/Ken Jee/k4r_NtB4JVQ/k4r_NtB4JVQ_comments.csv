@a_vickyp8360,2021-02-26T15:38:05Z,1,"#48: Ok, you love golf. And, this is what I meant with the Basketball video. It's much better to understand the idea (Not a Golf fan here he he)  About the factors, you read them in a book, or was it because of your expertise in Golf? (Not being an average golfer,  course conditions) Great analysis!!!!! #66daysofdata",True

@isambo400,2019-11-25T15:31:10Z,0,"Over the course of a long tournament, there is a mental benefit of hitting fairways.  But maybe longer hitters are psychologically able to respond to chaos better",True
@WingfanSports,2019-11-25T15:06:54Z,0,This is a great analysis!  It highlights in many ways the value of a caddy and the strategy that goes into every shot.  I imagine that players get printouts of each hole at a tournament and can gauge what risks are worth taking and which spots on the course that should be avoided at all costs.,True
