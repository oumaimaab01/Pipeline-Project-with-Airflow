The beginning part of understanding the concept, syntax of these programs were extremely difficult and questioned myself a few times. But through many hours of study and self motivation, I began getting a comfortable understanding to the logic and usage of these different tools. I now feel confident using and explaining data science, and now thinking of pursuing my graduate degree in DS. I want to tell anyone reading this.

@mrh5504,2021-10-23T23:54:12Z,2,"I‚Äôm a seasoned data analyst and can say the following. The big data domain, so that‚Äôs data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. It‚Äôs all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, don‚Äôt go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But that‚Äôs boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sorry for all the data engineers reading this, but it‚Äôs the truth and you know it. But hey, if you have a passion for that, go for it what can I say.   So this sums it up.

@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2021-04-09T21:10:33Z,1,"Just a couple of comments on this excellent video:  For Challenge 4: Actually I'd said find the COMPANIES you'd like to go in order to decide what you want to learn. Try to learn as much as you can from them, and not just their recruitment process. Now, I have yet to find a data science job but I've been around in the job hunting department. There's nothing that puts off an employer more than someone in an interview knowing nothing about the company (I've been there!) ... the reverse is also true, there's nothing more compelling for a prospective employer than an canditate who not just put out the work on their skills but on knowing the company (i've been there too!). It show commitment and the right kind too!  As for the continued learning part, I've learned (duh!) that it something that you need to do constantly for a good life anyways ... no matter what job or hobby you like to do. I probably cited the following quotes a 1000 times in my entourage and probably here too but listen (possibly again):  ""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but an habit!"". You'll find out that this quote holds true not just for data science but also ... anything really in life really.   It is also why challenge like #66daysofdata are valuable ... and not just for you professional career but, again ... for anything you want to do really.   There is a metric tons of things to say about habit formation and, again, I still stand by the methods of stephen guise (which really work well!), but the gist of it is actually quite simple:  work on making your habit sustainable long term before trying to put in massive loads of work. if you do the latter, chances are high you'll burn out (fast!). Do the former, and your brain and body will slowly adjust and adapt to that new habit you're trying to form.   PS: The variance is quite around the 66 mean to form a new habit. Some can take almost 215 days to form and others can take hold in as little as 12 days!!  (I've been there on both front!)  But, as they say, your mileage may vary!!

@jeffreyugochukwu1942,2021-04-09T21:04:52Z,21,"Thank you for the great video as always Ken. The grit aspect towards the end really speaks to me as someone trying to enter into the field. I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn't like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, ""Look Jeffrey, I know there's way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?"" My response was, ""Uh... I'm willing to work,"" and he said, ""*sigh* Everyone's willing to work."" I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn't for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald's after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook's Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I'm on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases.

As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are ""trending"") put emphasis on data viz & ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I've seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts.   I think it's important to learn skills that are trending once you're in the field, but until then it's better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services).

Data engineers, ML engineers, DAs, etc.  I like the tech side of it personally so I‚Äôm leaning more towards engineering and analysis.  But that‚Äôs just my preference.  It can be hard to break into ‚Äúdata science‚Äù. So I‚Äôd tell people to not get so hung up on the title.  When I finished my internship I had an offer for a data scientist role and a data analyst role.  The DA role played nearly twice as much and used much of the same tech.  Keep your options open.",True
