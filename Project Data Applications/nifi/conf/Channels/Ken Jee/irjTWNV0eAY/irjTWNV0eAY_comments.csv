@parkerbutterfield5967,2022-04-22T05:06:21Z,6,"This has got to be one of my favorite YouTube videos I’ve ever seen. I’m a freshman in computer science and minoring in stats, and I’ve always been a huge NBA fan. I know my undergrad program won’t teach me how to use Jupyter, numpy, or pandas until I start taking graduate level courses as an undergraduate. What is the best way for me to learn the jupyter programming environment and the different data science libraries?   Also, I think you should definitely make more sports analytics content. I think it’s definitely a great way to draw in people to the data science and analytics community.",True

I got the following results for the simulation- GSW Win  0.563814 % CLE Win  0.404884 % Tie  0.031302 %  Thank you Ken for this video.

@tbnrsports188,2020-07-07T16:19:26Z,1,"Hi Ken! Thank you for this video, I just used your code and built my own little model! Using 2020 data and looking back at the NBA games from back in March I would've correctly picked 9 of the 13 NBA over/unders correctly. This is a small sample size, but I believe the model I have is pretty accurate. However, I was wondering how I would make it more accurate? Like what new data points I should add to predict the score. I'm very excited about the return of the NBA.",True

@mkaberli,2020-01-07T01:10:59Z,1,"Thanks for the video, but why do yo have such a small screenshot of the code?  I’m watching this on an iPad and my eyesight sucks.  Also, what is the point of having your image in the lower right-hand corner.  Does you image make it easier to comprehend what concepts and ideas your expressing?  All that negative space is distracting from your content, which is interesting e",True
@joeholleran7079,2019-12-07T20:51:34Z,2,"Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation.   Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high.   For example:  If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense.  Do you see my point?  I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are?  Thanks again!",True
