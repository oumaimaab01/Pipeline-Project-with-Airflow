Honestly, you are like a catalyst for me to learn data science. At the start of 2021, I was just exploring things about data science and I came across your channel. Your content really helped me to move in a proper direction which is essential for me. The #66daysofdata is an amazing challenge that made me consistent to learn things.   12 months of journey taught me many things and now I got a huge surprise from you which I can never forget and I will always be thankful and grateful to you. I really don't have words to express my happiness.",True
