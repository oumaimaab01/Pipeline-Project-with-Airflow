@siyoungkim3672,2021-02-21T12:26:30Z,2,"I noticed you talked about how a data science major is more watered down than a DS masters, and how majoring in one area of DS could be better.  I’m currently choosing between majoring in CS at Penn State or data science at Purdue. Do you think the name recognition and internship opportunities at Purdue could outweigh the potential drawbacks, or should I just stick to CS at a less impressive school?  Also, the data science program at Purdue is relatively new, and students say many of the classes are similar to those a CS major takes. The main difference is that CS majors learn software engineering while DS majors learn statistics and data analysis.  Thanks, Siyoung Kim",True

@MrCobozco,2020-10-12T00:26:59Z,1,"Hi Ken. First off, thanks for all the quality content you put out. I have a question after watching this and your boot camp vs certificate video. I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option. I already have some programming history with a technology diploma and wouldn't mind the bootcamp. Thanks",True

I have always felt lucky that my school actually offers a Data Science undergrad program. But I also feel like school does not provide as much practical experience or project-based learning as internships do. However, getting an DS internship as someone who has only been in university for only two years is very difficult as well.

What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience?
