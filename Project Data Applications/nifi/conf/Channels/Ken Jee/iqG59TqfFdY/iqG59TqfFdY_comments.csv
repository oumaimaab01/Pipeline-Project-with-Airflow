Did you wrote understandable code, attended + DS events (This I think was tricky, the things we can't control), updated your README ‚û°Ô∏è Github, participated in Kaggle competitions, and made projects accessible (‚úÖ I think you kill it in this one, 2020 was the year where I knew you and has been a great journey!) I just making you accountable he he üòÖ #66daysofdata",True
@not_a_human_being,2019-12-29T00:59:13Z,0,"Great resolutions! Some of my comments: 1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both. 2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient. 3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it! 4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often. 5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.   My resolutions: 1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work. 2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels. 3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo) 4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML 5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert 6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field) 7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon!   Thank you for an interesting and relatable video!",True
@donnelly5757,2019-12-28T04:54:56Z,0,"My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall.  I will be using a lot of Codecademy, Dataquest, Udemy, and Kahn Academy. I would also like to have a handful of smaller projects uploaded to GitHub before the end of next summer.",True
@vinsanityreviews,2019-12-27T21:07:57Z,0,I‚Äôm new to data science and would like to know what you think the best programming languages are in the current state of the field.,True
@brennanruby7297,2019-12-27T14:36:38Z,0,As an analyst my resolution is to scrutinize each element of my reports and dashboards more.  I tend to focus more on the big picture and forget to focus on how each element could be improved.  As someone who is trying to learn data science my resolution is to give myself a project that seems achievable and finish it by the end of the year.  Documenting is one I think almost all of us can work on.,True
@brennanruby7297,2019-12-27T14:34:18Z,0,"I can't imagine explaining data science, I have enough trouble as it is explaining my job as a data analyst.  It has gotten to the point where I explain data as paint, a blank excel or power bi file as a canvas, and my job is to paint a picture that speaks to my audience.  Still think only half of my friends really understand.  Most just say ""oh so you know how to do pivot tables"" and move on.",True
