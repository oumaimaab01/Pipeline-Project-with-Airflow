@jab5100,2020-06-26T18:01:24Z,1,"Hey Ken,   does it matter whether my project goes into the model production aspects? Would it seem too lackluster to just cover exploratory data analysis aspects?   Also, does the model production aspect require machine learning? or is it even just things like prediction in regression?  Thanks again!",True

@brendangolledge8312,2020-06-22T16:14:52Z,0,"I just spent the last several months learning data science and I thought I was ready to start applying for jobs.  I did so this morning and to my great disappointment, I found that every entry level position required 2 years of experience and already had 100 applicants.  This gives me very unpleasant flashbacks to trying to apply for entry level electrical engineering jobs after I graduated.  I do not believe there is any quantity of hobby projects I could do that would allow me to enter this market.  I'm sorry, but your entire channel is a waste of time.",True
