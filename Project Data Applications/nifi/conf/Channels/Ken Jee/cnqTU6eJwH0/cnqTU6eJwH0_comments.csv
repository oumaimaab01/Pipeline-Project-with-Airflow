@TinaHuang1,2022-01-17T18:00:49Z,1,ah I thought you were gonna say you never did it :x,True
@Mhurilo10,2021-12-13T19:25:49Z,1,I'm not a data analyst or anything but just the idea of having an automated judge was enough to make me watch the whole thing haha,True
@a.hsumon9640,2021-11-10T18:52:12Z,1,"Hi Ken. I am a undergrad student and I am deeply interested in Data science. In final year, should I do thesis or do project on data science? ThanksInAdvance",True

@mattRRgraham1996,2021-10-15T01:27:38Z,2,"Lol, for my research project in grad school I wrote some models based off of LSA, GloVe, and Word2Vec and the best accuracy I got was 16% from w2v. My LSA model was scoring at 4% lmao. it was hilariously bad. It really was humorous to me just how bad they were performing. I was able to (over some grueling months) get my W2V model up to 65% accuracy which for the task at hand, I still consider to be quite good honestly.",True
@alittleofthis08,2021-10-12T21:47:58Z,2,"Thank you so much for your great content, Ken! I enjoy your channel so much. I'm kind of an outlier here. LOL I did a masters in statistics in the 80's and then was a statistical consultant for agricultural projects using SAS for several years. After a 35-year hiatus from formal data analysis (but not from thinking data and teaching math) I came back last year to complete a data science certification to try to get up to speed in the data world. Wow! What a challenge!  I did one big project for my certification, but I want to do several more for my own benefit and for my portfolio before I start looking for contracts. Your videos give me lots of possibilities. I just really enjoy how you present ideas. Thank you again.",True
@datasciencegraduate432,2021-10-10T07:17:58Z,0,Great video Ken! Can definitely relate to your thumbnail when I was working on my first project lol ðŸ˜‚,True
@829Alejandro,2021-10-10T01:30:04Z,0,"Hey Ken, I've been enjoying your videos! Great channel you have by the way. I'm currently a junior in college, pursuing a degree in mathematics and I have a interest in the data science field. I've taken a couple of programming classes like intro to computer science and predicative analytics and I still plan to learn more on my own free time. Will employers still prefer a computer science major over a math major? What are your thoughts?",True
@datasciencefromzero2666,2021-10-09T16:57:17Z,1,Failures and bad experiences are what I need to hear as a junior. Because that's what happens to me mostly and everyone talks about good things happened to them which is unreal.,True
@NicholasRenotte,2021-10-08T22:59:40Z,0,HE'S BACK!! Awesome vid Ken!,True
@arthurmiller5276,2021-10-08T18:33:56Z,0,"ðŸ¤”""If you knew then what you know now"" (or even recreate the same project now) could you do a better job or is predicting the judging on a match just a 50% success? Also, did your model take into consideration the judges themselves as (in)consistent variables?  Everyone's first attempts at something don't look good as subsequent efforts, particularly after years of experience. Do you apply how you've ""failed"" (even today) to improving your skills or possibly utilize the failure data as part of your model(s)?",True
@farhanislam8463,2021-10-08T17:30:10Z,1,"Is most code for almost all projects just copied from one source or another, and we just change the parameter values  ,like epochs, or batch_size? Or is there something else, regarding making projects?",True

@dakotahwilson3104,2021-10-08T16:36:15Z,1,"Thanks Ken! I'm just starting my first data project for grad school and it's still in the data collection phase. I have a team of four undergrads working for me so right now I'm still trying to figure out what it is I'll want to analyze and present to the grant makers but we have some time to figure that part out.  Do you have any advice for the pre-planning phase of research? I feel more comfortable in my coding than I do in project management but in this case, it's all part of the same project.",True
@shrutijain1628,2021-10-08T15:39:46Z,2,But talkin âœ¨g about something purely my idea . I think I had problem with defining the problem statement and looking for right data . I just use to see the topic I want to work on and not on the problem statement. And secondly also I use to just take data if it's related to the topic and not to the problem statement biggest mistake . Took me a lot of time to get out of this mindset,True

@DataProfessor,2021-10-08T13:24:49Z,17,"Glad to see you Ken, thanks for sharing your learning experience of your first project. This video is so good, gotta take some notes: 1. Start that first project, rinse and repeat 2. Wrestle with your problem and donâ€™t give up too early 3. Donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes, experiment and learn from it 4. Embrace failure and take it as a learning opportunity 5. Kenâ€™s tips: project planning, problem definition, documentation, clear communication and sharing your work",True
@MrViperHiggins,2021-10-08T13:16:23Z,2,"Great video Ken, it's something I struggle with too having a specific goal in mind. Its the most important thing in any project. Also love the Ryder Cup shirt Europe will come back swinging next time lol!",True
