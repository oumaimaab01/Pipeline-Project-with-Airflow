@jgonsalk,2023-09-04T06:50:34Z,1,"Awesome video! Totally agree. I think one thing you didn't cover but will likely change is movies and TV shows. I think there will be several developments.   I think, like you mentioned, barriers to entry will drop so low budget movies will be able to look amazing. This will lead to lots of niche content with strong followings.   I also think that big budget movies will use AI to let people change movies to suit audiences better. This will start with something basic, like using AI to create a child-friendly version of a movie where nudity, violence and profanity is taken out. It'll also be used for dubbing.   But it will go crazy when people start watching movies where they deep fake their faces onto it so they can watch the Avengers but it's you, your mates and your families in the movie and the characters actually look, sound and maybe even act like you.   I also think that content creators will start building out the extended universe of TV shows like Star Wars. These won't be canon but it makes sense to let people take the IP and make their own fan pics and then pay a cut to the corporations that own it. There will be restrictions about how they can be used (i.e. no Star Wars porn parodies using AI to use the original cast) but it seems inevitable and makes business sense as the best stuff will make them money and everything else costs nothing. They can probably remake the best content and not even pay the original creators if they find something is working. Basically crowdsourcing blockbusters (I don't think that would be fair but that is very separate from whether I think it'll happen).",True

@Limestarz,2023-08-29T00:32:34Z,0,"Well customer service will be interesting because small businesses are a huge chunk of the market and you can't really use AI on tiny data, so I don't know how useful chatbots will be for small businesses in general. I use chatgpt daily and it struggles on anything that doesn't have a lot info/written about it. Also chatgpt still struggles with vague questions or sentences where as a human would either understand the ask or likely ask for further clarification where as AI tries to be a chad and answer based off incomplete information/sentences creating a terrible customer service experience because then you either have to reask it or think its correct when its going in the wrong direction (no real fault of the AI but really just an issue with the user input). I would say AI still has a ways to go and like most cutting edge tech is always ""10 years away from being good"" LOL.   The CEO of OpenAi/chatgpt made an interesting comment saying the limit of AI might have been hit and that might take some really difficult/interesting  methods for it to even get marginally better. If that is even remotely true we might be seeing a flat line of AI growth, and I would say its like Telsa's auto selfdriving that came out (in what 2014? That's almost a decade old now) and still hasn't progressed like everyone thought. We were all suppose to have self driving cars and truckers and uber drivers were suppose to be out of job etc etc by now.",True

@martin5504,2023-08-17T07:09:17Z,0,"It is not AI that will cause the changes. It is the way people will use it. Human to human contact is one of the great drivers of constructive activity, when this decreases humanity will increasingly become separate from each other. I'm not sure of the consequences but I am sure it will not be be helpful.",True
@gothparadigm,2023-08-15T16:11:12Z,2,"although i'm currently a cybersecurity student, i've noticed that field already utilizes AI for detecting and mitigating threats as two examples. i do wonder how much more things will augment as time goes on. c: this is probably an unpopular opinion; however, i find it rather oddly fascinating to live during this time, especially as a sci-fi lover. i compare the feeling to that of: ""pinch me, am i dreaming?""",True
@LukeBarousse,2023-08-15T01:05:06Z,2,6:43 Crazy how a press release surges intrest in a tool. Especially in this Copilot case.  It's such an undervalued tool right now and X is just going to take it to another level,True
@bin4ry_d3struct0r,2023-08-14T22:01:19Z,3,Does the idea of training an AI using AI-generated data seem super sus to anyone else in that we're potentially building a garbage-in-garbage-out feedback loop?,True
@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2023-08-14T21:47:25Z,2,It's not necessarily bad right? I am wondering why you mentioned it's going to disrupt them specifically instead of just being integrated,True
