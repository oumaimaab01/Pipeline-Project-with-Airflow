@datasciencefromzero2666,2021-10-21T19:29:08Z,1,"@Ken! This video tells me that you really REALLY like cooking =) Who would go through this for a data science video without love for food and cooking?! Great analogies! I want to add one more to your analogies if I may... Good quality food = Good quality data. Often times neglected, but makes the most impact =) Also, here is a riddle for all foodies and people who loves to cook. I came up with this after many years of cooking and baking. Here it is: What is in every recipe that you doesn't have a taste? The answer also makes sense from the data science perspective =)",True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-04-20T16:10:58Z,2,"#66 + 2: This is great Ken, now on I will never forget the steps with the cooking analogy :) It's really funny how you talk about the cooking tools; when it's the moment I literally will draw a picture of an oven, stove, etc to remember each method ü•ò As always, thank you! #66daysofdata",True

@piyushzope10,2021-01-13T17:23:00Z,7,One more common thing here guys.... We try to build a project by different methods or by different algorithms and in the same way we try to make a dish by using different methods....,True
@piyushzope10,2021-01-13T17:20:32Z,5,Hey Ken this is interesting... I also cook sometimes but never tried to relate this with data science but you have explained it very well..... I will definitely try this....I hope this will also improve my cooking üòÅ,True
@Pakman909,2020-07-19T16:54:06Z,8,Amazing analogy! I'll definitely borrow this when I need to explain what data science is,True

What path do you recommend for me to become a data scientist (since step1)  And if you have time, (i cant find anywhere ) make a v√≠deo doing a model, basically what a data scientist does, but actually doing it. Thanks for the content, you are really good keep going",True
@davidyoo647,2020-02-07T17:22:01Z,2,unexpected but interesting comparison! i definitely agree with you on the feature engineering portion,True
