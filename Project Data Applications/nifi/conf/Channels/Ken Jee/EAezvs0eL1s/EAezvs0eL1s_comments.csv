@esthermwaura6674,2021-07-21T17:44:53Z,1,"Ken Jee,  Thank you very much for your detailed explanation. i now have a better understanding of the MSE, RMSE, Cross-Val. Much Appreciated.",True
@piyushthakur2386,2021-04-19T14:52:59Z,1,"Hi Ken ,  understanding it as you talk . keep talking . üòÄ",True
@piyushzope10,2021-04-07T20:34:40Z,4,"Anyone, Would you like to suggest any dataset different than the vehicle on which I can try out these operations?",True
@piyushzope10,2021-04-07T20:31:48Z,4,"Hey, the present dataset on Kaggle has some changes in it so is it a good thing? I replicated this regression and I have gained much from it.  This playlist is really promoting me to explore more and more... As I am getting many questions, which is really good for growth  As always thank you very much for the video...",True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-03-02T01:07:02Z,1,"#49: My DS journey started exploring Machine Learning and later on the EDA and Data, not sure if was the right path  - ‚ÄúLife is a continuous exercise in creative problem solving‚Äù right? - but this video just made me happy. I actually know something! Yay!!! #66daysofdata",True
@azwin6506,2021-02-04T16:42:14Z,1,"Thanks for this video. Started using SPYDER IDE, liking it over VS Studio and Jupyter Lab. VS had issues with the Jup extension, not plotting the null heatmap with 400k rows. When comparing to your current videos (late 2020), your content presentation has improved DRASTICALLY. Thanks again!",True
@SerenD23,2020-11-28T02:48:46Z,1,"Thanks for making these videos! I know its niche, but it's extremely helpful!",True
@bifomoabdallah706,2020-10-27T21:07:59Z,1,"Hi Ken, this is so helpful...but I do not get why does the constant appear on my co-relation plot!",True
@felixnicholas6312,2020-09-16T12:33:02Z,1,"Hi there Ken! As always, your video is really helpful for someone who just started learning about data science, in the line 41 and 42, why would you apply the lower/upper change only to data.desc.head instead of data.head? Thanks for the informative video, I learned a lot from it!!",True
@jideraheem3813,2020-09-13T06:26:31Z,1,"Hi Ken! Your videos are tremendously helpful. Thank you. I need some direction please. I was trying to replicate your  steps here.  When I ran  : 'scores = cross_val_score(reg4,x4,y4, cv=5, scoring= 'neg_mean-squared-error')'. Here was the bug I got:  ValueError: 'neg_mean-squared-error' is not a valid scoring value. Use sorted(sklearn.metrics.SCORERS.keys()) to get valid  options.  Could you assist please",True
@kelline1979,2020-08-23T13:06:12Z,0,"Wow, a very detailed lesson on single and multi regression with cross-validation. regarding your comment to have the actual selling price information, is it for error computation or for model fitting? will there be leakage if use in model fitting? thanks.",True
@mariontan9317,2020-08-08T18:25:35Z,1,"Hi Ken, At the cross validation part, why didn't you check for the R^2 for the 5 different tests too? Thanks for the video!",True
@chaitanyamundle3713,2020-07-16T10:38:23Z,1,Another query. Why do we have to set the variables like odometer and price into specific format or  scale them?,True
@chaitanyamundle3713,2020-07-14T07:57:05Z,1,So first we perform data manipulation and cleaning which you taught in the previous videos before linear regression right ?,True
@aunterong6813,2020-05-25T08:03:10Z,1,"Hi Ken,  at 8:58, the boxplots of the  price and odometer look the same after removing the outliers.  I am quite confused. Could you explain a little further?   Thanks",True
@LewiUberg,2020-05-13T05:36:19Z,1,"I just found out my last assessment for the year is going to be a Regression Analysis,  so this may come in handy :)",True
@jansenlopez7572,2020-03-24T06:01:51Z,1,"Sir Ken, what IDE are you using? Seems better than Jupyter.",True
@joukrae593,2019-11-30T14:55:34Z,1,üêº Panda love to see that import statementüòçüòç....video was a treat to watch ...,True
