@benjaminchen4367,2019-07-25T18:46:10Z,2,"Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it.    Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed.",True
