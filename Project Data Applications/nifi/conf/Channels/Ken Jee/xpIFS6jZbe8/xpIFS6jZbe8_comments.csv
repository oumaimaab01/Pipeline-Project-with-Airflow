Whats used is Excel, Tableau / Power BI and if more advanced SQL. Why the focus on Python and R when these roles are likely to be those used extensively not by analysts but senior level Data Scientists? Is this the standard in Tech or Big Tech FAANG roles? It appears for a lot of companies these higher skill roles are not used in their daily usage of data for analyst positions in their actual work.

I am visual person so makeing it my own by styling was how I learnt the best. Loving the colour or direction of xlable I could control, my understanding and interest peaked.

@BbB-vr9uh,2022-03-08T17:23:53Z,4,"Agree on Pandas. To be effective at getting value out of data, it seems (to me anyway) that learning what Pandas can do is more beneficial than learning to create your own (likely worse) implementation.   I spent a summer internship doing poorly what I could have done much more easily and robustly if I looked into what I could do with pandas.   But I came from a background of c++ courses in college, and was not used to the approach of learning to effectively use tools that were out there for the public like pandas.",True

I know the basics of python for data science (pandas, numpy, etc) and I have done a few projects on kaggle. However, I am going to soon pursue a masters in data science and I am worried about the math. How much math is really required for data science? Intuitively, I understand why statistics plays a big role, but what about linear algebra and calculus? Like, how much of those do you need and what specific topics / learning objectives should you know before you can confidently say they are sufficient? (Sufficient to be a data scientist)  Also - I understand that data science is a huge field and different parts of data science requires different skillsets, but I am looking to be right in between data analysis and machine learning.

Apart from that, I will try to do as many projects as I can and start freelancing in late 2022",True

@mh4841,2021-12-27T16:08:56Z,19,"Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.",True

El pr√≥ximo a√±o mi meta es tener un nivel B1 de ingles y usare tus videos para lograrlo. ¬°Muchas gracias!,True
@PR-kd8fv,2021-12-27T14:37:15Z,7,"Ken, what I have found is all these online projects / learnings mostly gives 10 variables and ask to predict a 11th one. But in the real world it‚Äôs very difficult to goto that level of identifying a problem and later identifying a approach to solver a problem . Until now I have not seen any course teaching that.

@achmadrifkiraihansyahbagja2113,2021-12-27T13:32:55Z,4,"""When beginning with this projects, they don't have to be original. You can go through the exact same analysis that someone else did, and still learn something. But typical learning session could just be you having someone else's project on half the screen and you typing it line-by-line and running it on other half of the screen. As you do this you can change the parameters, you can  experiment with different visuals and see how it works as you go.""  This one what i've been thinking for. i feel like i do nothing if i see someone's project and copy it to my notebook, but you just said it and i totally agree. we can experiment it with changing the code, maybe we use a different way to clean the data, or just define a function that others use repeated code, (a.k.a use DRY concept), and so on.  thanks Ken Jee, it really helps me out.",True
