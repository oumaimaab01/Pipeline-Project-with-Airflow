@xixi5896,2023-06-18T09:48:55Z,2,Hi Ken! thanks for making this great tutorial. Can you do tutorial on fine tuning the NLP pretrained model? there are few videos out there but I think you are more advanced on communicating the technical things so it's make us easier to understand. Thanks!,True
@WingfanSports,2023-06-14T15:59:37Z,1,Being on a hill also means less risk of water damage given any runoff will flow downhill.  I'm assuming a depression is opposite and runoff will flow and pool towards the hoke,True
@aronpollner,2023-06-09T13:41:46Z,0,"Hey Ken, have you tried using ChatGPT with Noteable plugin to help you solve a Kaggle competition? I used it and it works (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKfJT5QF_I), I think people will enjoy if you made a video using that",True
@chiedozieonyearugbulem9363,2023-06-07T15:33:23Z,1,Thanks Ken for the tutorials. I'm not really a fan of your videos because they're not technical enough but I really enjoyed this and learnt a couple of things. Wish you could make more of these,True
@eric_welch,2023-06-07T04:05:08Z,1,"I am a material scientists who works with large data sets and I want to pivot into data science because I've grown to love how data is manipulated and analyzed outside of just scientific applications.  academia has been exhausting and I want to refresh things in a new field.  Do you by chance do any personal life coaching??  regardless, thank you for your videos, they are both motivational and instructional!!",True

@ifeanyinwobodo8530,2023-05-19T00:59:37Z,1,Wonderful content as always.  But you could literally reset the default theme to 'plotly_dark'. This would have been better than repeating most of the layout update.,True
@theawesomeharris,2023-05-18T03:57:20Z,2,"I think to make the code less confusing, the y_test could be replaced by y_valid like some notebooks did so the test suffix is reserved for the real test data.  Thank you for your wonderful videos and your codes are always so clean and easy to follow! Cheers!",True

@jawunderwood,2023-05-17T05:08:08Z,1,"As a practicing data scientist, how important would you say it is to handle calculations such as integrals by hand? I studied this stuff 10 years ago and have since had my skills atrophy. Though the intuition is still there. Is it worth going through that stuff again or just diving into the deep end?",True
