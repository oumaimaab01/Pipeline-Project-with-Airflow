@konstantinradu4399,2022-04-03T09:22:25Z,1,"Hi Ken I got called after 2 days for a position called business controller junior intern, and I rejected them as I have exams behind and as they were offering me a 8h full time which seemed impossible combined with studies or attending lessons. I thought that after this I could later transition to business analyst and data analyst.

@zuxzux,2022-03-29T22:17:55Z,1,"This is a great video. I will echo your point about networking being extremely valuable. Both myself and many of my friends have landed their current jobs because of a referral from someone in the company. In fact, one thing to add is that most companies offer referral bonuses to current employees who refer someone that eventually gets hired. So, it's not only good for you as a job seeker to network and make connections, there's also a big incentive for employees to network with you and give you that referral.",True
@waynedev7734,2022-03-29T07:32:59Z,1,"awesome video, it's the portfolio part for me, I can assert to that since it happened to me like a month ago.

@bm1006,2022-03-25T17:53:45Z,1,"Most HR women are not going to read your portfolio because they don't understand it.  They read your resume first, make you take a coding test that doesn't actually reflect the job, then if you pass the coding test,  you get to talk to the hiring manager who might then be interested in your portfolio but most of them are not going to be too interested unless it 100% matches what they do for their projects",True

@yoelbenyossef,2022-03-25T15:06:26Z,2,"The issue with trying AB testing with the CVs that you send is that you don't send that many CVs or get that many results. The small sample size can really skew your results. Something that no one tells you is when people hire. I got most of my job in early fall and early spring. It's not uncommon to not get a single callback for months, and then all of sudden get more than I can handle. The other thing is, since HR tends to read your CVs first, be sure to tailor your CV to them with buzzwords that they'll understand.",True

@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-03-25T14:49:36Z,1,"The finding what you like advice is imo so overlooked, I'm glad you covered it. It's always the thing I put as step 1 in my content about learning Machine Learning/implementing it for businesses.   Wrt to the portfolio point you make, you're spot on. However I think what is arguably more valuable than having a specific project for industry is to read how different industries make money. This will allow you to get a birds eye view of what is important, what is feasible, technical challenges etc. That way you can highlight different aspects of your projects to different parties.",True

It‚Äôs competitive out here but keep going. My biggest hurdle is  behavioral interviews but I‚Äôll keep going.  Edit: also always try to add a personal touch to how you know the business in your interview. Show the employer you went out your way not to just know about the data side of their business, but also about their specific problems and How it ties into their product and service offerings.",True
