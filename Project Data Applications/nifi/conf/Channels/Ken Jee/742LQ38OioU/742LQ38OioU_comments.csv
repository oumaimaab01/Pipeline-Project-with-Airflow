@ImportData1,2020-07-01T16:12:34Z,3,"Time management is one of the most important skills! One of the things I did in college to stay focused & productive was to have a solid wall between the studying/productive time and my leisure time. For instance, I would be productive from 9am-1pm and reward myself by doing something fun (playing games, playing with my dog, etc.) for about an hour! Then I would get back to the productive time from 2pm-7pm and reward myself again!",True

I would really appreciate if you guys would come up with a video on how to start as a datascientist from scratch like a complete beginner to getting a job in FAANG. Discussing everything like how to start of with projects, best resources, how to learn ML and AI and then how to get a job and ace coding interviews stuff like that. Trust me if you do this your podcast or respective channels will explode. Pls do consider to make a podcast on it.",True
