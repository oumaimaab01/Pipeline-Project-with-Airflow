@KenJee_ds,2021-07-08T20:45:37Z,10,Thanks for watching everyone! I hope it helps you to better understand how APIs work and why they are useful to us as data scientists. Definitely go check out the Tiff In Tech YouTube channel after finishing this video: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4MZ7zUHb5eAxU75Dc_nqdQ,True

@raedokal,2022-09-21T08:45:22Z,1,No thank you üòÅ,True
@developerx962,2021-09-23T11:10:31Z,1,Thank you bro  about each word you talked it,True
@Cristian-bg1pr,2021-08-29T21:09:13Z,1,Hey Ken! Any suggestions regarding a course related to API or data engineering stuff? Thank you!,True
@sianoikimari,2021-08-28T21:58:50Z,1,Fire explanation!!,True
@easytutorial1869,2021-07-27T02:41:03Z,0,What should I choose between B.tech Cse with specialization in ai/ml engineering and B.tech Cse with specialization in data science?,True
@eyitaderinsola8513,2021-07-14T09:26:25Z,1,If I had a dollar for every time I googled about API's...          prolly just have like 50 dollars by now.,True
@cedriclouguet6525,2021-07-12T15:55:42Z,2,Your 5min videos are perfect for my pomodoro breaks. They help me staying motivated on my journey to learn data science and become a data scientist ! üí™  Keep up the good work ! üëç,True
@365DataScience,2021-07-12T13:35:47Z,11,You mean that API does not stand for Automatic Pizza Ingredients? üòî,True
@Mark-lk8ds,2021-07-11T23:01:29Z,1,"Great video! But completely unrelated, at my college I have a choice to get either a BA or BS in data science. Do you think employers care if I have one or the other? I‚Äôve been looking around online, but I feel like someone who is actually in the field would have the best idea.",True
@harshitsati,2021-07-11T13:09:45Z,1,Yess I always wanted to start with APIs uwu,True
@mariopaul6505,2021-07-10T22:12:43Z,1,WOAH no glasses!!  Haha but It's really amazing to see how much better your videos have gotten in the past year!  Loving the content Ken!   #Roadto200K,True
@BharatR97,2021-07-10T19:44:07Z,1,"@Ken, I would guess APIs will be needed for any software related profession going forward That said, what's the deal with papayas üòè? And could you consider a walkthrough of creating an API from a data science model as one of your future YouTube videos? Please consider adding it to your (probably already huge) backlog / list üòÖ",True
@drgarad,2021-07-10T00:18:54Z,1,"Your thumbnail is trash for a mobile viewers, which means not appealing to most of YouTube users.   Note: Small font, and hard to understand thumbnail.",True
@arthurmiller5276,2021-07-09T18:38:04Z,1,"One thing I LOVE about your videos is you provide notes in the description so viewers don't have to scramble to copy down information spoken to quickly or flashed on the screen for a few seconds. (This of course is second to your sense of humor. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ @ 0:05 ""Automatic Papaya Integration"")  One suggestion / request: would it be possible to replace LONG URLs with tiny URLs?  Cutting-n-pasting the description notes often leads to long URLs cut off with "". . ."" at the end instead of the full URL text. The only choice is to manually go to each site and copy the full URL for later reference.",True
@piyushzope10,2021-07-09T18:18:52Z,5,"Some topics for video are, 1. How will Automation affect IT jobs? 2. Where do you see data science after next 10 years?",True

@piyushzope10,2021-07-09T17:57:34Z,6,API is like ready to eat food...üòâ,True
@GriefHC,2021-07-09T16:18:05Z,2,"Great video, Ken! Tiff has some great videos too, thanks for recommending her channel.",True
@DataProfessor,2021-07-09T15:20:49Z,12,"Crystal clear explanation from both you Ken and Tiff. Aside from being the best way to get access to data, API is also the best way to automatically acquire papayas ü§£",True
@infinitedata7088,2021-07-09T14:32:53Z,2,"Hey, Nice explanation.  Can you make a  video of #shorts about statistics concepts.",True
@anubhavgoyal3211,2021-07-09T14:29:38Z,7,Notes from the video ‚Ä¢API : Application programming interface ‚Ä¢API is basically messenger between two applicants. It recieves a request from the user and we get the response ‚Ä¢It is important for data scientist's because of :- a) best way to access data. Many websites gives access to data through API b) reliable and consistent c) one of the best ways to make your model useful is to turn it into an API d) saves us time through reusability (leveraging pre built models)  ‚Ä¢How to use an API?  Find a documentation for an API of your interest and send a request to API ‚Ä¢How to make API?  Create a basic web server that takes requests and returns responses,True
@winerw9217,2021-07-09T14:13:50Z,1,Hi Ken Jee can you add subtitle for this video?,True
@anubhavgoyal3211,2021-07-09T14:03:53Z,3,Maybe a dedicated video on freelancing as a data scientist?,True
@shrutijain1628,2021-07-09T13:50:21Z,3,It is very important but still a hard concept to grasp üíØüôå,True

@CENTRALEAGLE68,2021-07-09T13:09:16Z,2,Such a timely video.   Is there a tree of some sort that outlines the branches of learning you should take for a data science job?,True
@adelorton727,2021-07-09T13:05:25Z,5,I am literally seeing this video while using YouTube api to get my data lol,True
