@NicholasRenotte,2021-07-20T11:31:35Z,1,"Came for the papaya, stayed for the wisdom and wizardry! 🔥🔥 stream Ken, congrats to you and the community! If you haven’t already definitely read David Goggin’s book (Can’t Hurt Me) and Jesse Itzler’s book where Goggin’s lives with him for 30 days (Living with a Seal), I read them both and went a little H.A.M off the back of it and did an impromptu 65k ultra marathon last year.   Also, was taking notes all through the stream, and added some of my thoughts: 1. Yes there are a lot of tools out there particularly stuff that will automate and streamline DS and ML workflows. There are however a TONNN of companies which have barely scratched the surface when it comes to DS having an adept captain at the wheel is going to be the difference between them being successful versus not. (18:24) 2. Advice on self studying data science, just get started with something! 100% hands down the best advice, pick something you’re interested in and go for it (32:31) 3. Loved the fact that you both called out developing fundamental skills. Having a strong base allows you to move quickly and stay up to date with innovation in the field (51:50), I’m off to study LDA right now.   N.b. Had a little freak out when you dropped the c word (c***right strike) 😅",True

I use your videos as a reference or to give me better general direction whenever I feel overwhelmed about the Data Science journey and I love how you: - Talk about the more personal (softer) aspects of Data Science in the workplace or outside - Live your personal life or measure up your daily routines/activities in a Data Science kind of way/approach!,True
