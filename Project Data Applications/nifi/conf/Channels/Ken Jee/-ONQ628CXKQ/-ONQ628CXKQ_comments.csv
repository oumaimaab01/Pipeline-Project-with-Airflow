@yusufbassa6884,2021-04-21T19:20:25Z,1,Hi there! I recalled you mentioning that you could become a data scientist in 6 months if you put your head to it. Does this include a certified degree which will allow you to be applicable for a job which a 3/4 year degree student would be applicable for?,True
@mastermind3335,2021-04-20T13:55:32Z,4,"Sir,please provide your advise on this:  i'm a student aspiring to become a data scientist.But i only know python as much as till looping and conditional statements.I also know the basics of pandas like reading dataframes and assigning that to a variable.But another youtuber said that if we need to become a data scientist,we must start working on data science projects ASAP and that we must learn whatever skills we require for that project along the way.But i saw a kaggler's end to end project solution and nearly recieved a stroke as everything looked like Greek and Latin.Pls help as i dont know where to begin for solving data science projects. (i)Please suggest the appraoch that i shd take towards solving data science projects as i still dont know a lot of the programming required though im eager to learn (ii)Also,how can i increase my knowledge quickly in tensorflow,seaborn etc that are required to begin doing projects",True

@pasc.zeke25,2021-04-17T08:13:43Z,1,hi sir. Is it possible to get a freelance data science job even tough I only have a bootcamp and no experience at all. I'm planning to shift to data science career but as of now I can't risk to resign on my current job so I'm planning to have a frealance/work from home job before becoming fulltime on DS. Any suggestions on how to get a freelance job or On the Job Training? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP!,True
@wilsonman8661,2021-04-17T03:47:23Z,3,"Always interesting to see numbers and get a better understanding of the magnitude of differences. In hindsight, it makes sense but the cold emailing thing was a surprise to me. Thanks for sharing this, Ken.",True

@quinnherden,2021-04-16T23:21:50Z,2,"Hey Ken :) Thank you for all the amazing content. I've been binging this past week, since finding your channel.  I have some constructive criticism. I've noticed that the mixing is frequently ""off"" when you're interviewing someone. Your volume is typically leveled higher than the guest's, which makes it difficult to consume, without having the volume dial at the ready, to live mix.  Regardless, I appreciate you and the work you've done for this community!",True
@jameshizon4861,2021-04-16T23:06:58Z,4,"I enjoy LinkedIn. I now need to keep ""Cold Emailer"" in my job search skill set. ‚ùÑüìß  I did initially try the ""Spray and Pray"" method (failed w/ lots of applications). So, the other two is definitely the ""Go-To.""",True
@joshcummins3916,2021-04-16T20:36:29Z,2,I finished interview for a computer vision engineer.  It's been 7 days and I'm just waiting for an email or call telling me if I got it or not.  Previously  I spoke to a recruiter at Facebook and AWS They never got back to me. It can be discouraging to apply and just get ghosted.,True

@byoutekinaeiyuu,2021-04-16T18:26:51Z,1,Interesting data :),True
@LukeBarousse,2021-04-16T17:37:59Z,16,I love to use cold emails/messages to network.  When i first started doing this it was so weird.  What I found was offering some type of value to the person was best to gain traction and also have a better feeling myself knowing that I wasn't just using this new person as a resource only.  New relationships can be mutually benefiical for both parties and it shouldn't just be one-way!  Great content as always Ken!,True

@nicom9853,2021-04-16T14:54:52Z,8,"If I understood the article correctly this is only for US and Canada. As a European I think the data may differ drastically due to the job market culture. In my opinion here Universities are the most popular and even maybe the only way to get into the field if you want companies to look at you seriously. It's just my opinion, bit I am pointing this out for your international viewers just in case.",True

@AdriaanVanNiekerk,2021-04-16T13:40:42Z,10,"I think if you want to go the cold-call email route, a nice python automation script might cut down a lot of time.  You should be able to scrape a lot of companies' email addresses and then send out emails to them with your CV. This can be repeated or done once-off? Or would it be better to cater each email to the comany that you send it to?",True
@shrutijain1628,2021-04-16T13:38:38Z,4,From opinion likedin would be better option because normal job application goes through resume software which get rejected mostly so  networking with people on LinkedIn engaging and making connections and talking to potential recruiter will be best choice but bad side of cold email  is  getting those mail people sometimes spam those which is totally not cool ....these are my opinion of course other people can have there own as wellüôåüíØ,True
