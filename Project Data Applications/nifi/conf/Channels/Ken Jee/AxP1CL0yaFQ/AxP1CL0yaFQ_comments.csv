@JMann-pd2vg,2024-04-16T14:08:42Z,0,Of course you should learn R if you are interested in ML and statistics. Python is a waste of time if your job is related to data science and analysis. I have used both languages and find R to be superior to python.,True
@Vikermajit,2023-08-09T17:00:14Z,1,Tqvm for sharing your experience and opinion,True
@jannonflores1113,2022-03-31T17:45:12Z,10,"I love how R can be used by people with no programming background and can be good at it right away.  I know some are saying that Python is an easy language and that it‚Äôs like an english but when it comes to data analysis, data wrangling etc. i feel like R syntax is much easier to read compared to python syntax when doing data analysis. I love how Dplyr has this thing called ‚Äúpipe‚Äù where it makes your code much much easier to read. I‚Äôm pretty sure most of you guys get my point.",True

@niceday2015,2021-09-29T17:10:10Z,1,Focus on one at the the beginning then move to another one to take the advantage of the two nice software,True
@faizalshebli9520,2021-08-25T23:07:45Z,3,"Im more to business focus DS so I'm using python as my primary tool. I will use R when I am working on a relevant domain for it. Pretty much depends on the domain of the project I am working on. For business domain, Python is sufficient for me at least. Cheers.",True
@RakeshKumar-zj4hu,2021-04-19T14:07:35Z,1,"why do we want to program for data science. We need to make that clear. Data Science and ML is all about finding patterns and predicting results. Once you get the results then use anything to make that result work. I'm really fed up of hearing R is not flexible, R is not programmer friendly. But does it get the job done, yes, then where's the argument. This trend started when programmers got to believe they can do ML and DS",True

@piyushzope10,2021-03-05T14:58:12Z,5,"Actually, I learned R somewhat during my college days because it was in my syllabus. It was good but yes as medical research is not relevant for me right now then I am learning python these days...  I think R may be useful these days as there many predictions and research is on COVID.",True

@GG-yk2nc,2021-02-16T15:36:24Z,29,"For someone who tries to learn a programming language to specifically run statistical analysis (GLM, regression, ANOVA, FA, HLM, SEM...), R is definitely the one to go with.",True
@naevan1,2021-02-15T22:00:17Z,1,"I already kinda know beginner/intermediate R due to university (math) but from all the videos information I get, everyone suggests python so I want to learn python... But my selected masters ALSO does things in R(msc stats and data science) so fuck my life I guess I'll have to Learn python after R the way things are going üòÇüòÇ",True
@yunes7305,2021-02-05T20:04:45Z,1,"Hi. Thanks for your review, but it seems like unfair to compare Apple üçé to orange . Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data,  the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data.  Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc..  Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions.   Machine learning,  users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models.  If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it.   Every language is important,  know what you need to achieve first.  Than choose what is most comprehensive language that will fulfill  ur need and don't rush yourself much.",True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-01-24T15:52:08Z,1,"#21: I totally agree it's better to start with #Python, is more flexible, easy to learn, with more examples and people involved. And if it's required R, as all programming languages are easy to transfer. #66daysofdata",True

@rayjohndelapena3766,2020-12-18T03:06:17Z,1,I use R on my work for almost 2yrs. And wondering if it is worth it to sticking on R or transition completely to python. My work is mostly for data engineering and automation.,True

@prod.kashkari3075,2020-11-14T04:23:43Z,11,"To be honest, a person who can wield two swords is the one who is the most deadly. I like to leverage both in my workflow. R gives me beautiful visualizations and rapid fast data cleaning with tidyverse packages, and I can use python for fitting machine learning models with sklearn and dimensionality reduction, as well as neural networks. Both have their benefits and I don‚Äôt think one should use just one vs the other.",True

@hemnfarhad8551,2020-08-04T07:26:42Z,1,"How about a movement the other way around, from R to Python? or at least, how to start obtaining some fluency in python when you have started with learning R?  thanks.",True
@RoyoItakoride,2020-07-21T10:36:34Z,4,"I prefer using both,sometimes its just exiciting if you have tools that Can close the disadvantages of another tools.I used R for analyzing data and it's easy to do many statistical testing than python, in my opinion,but remember you also need to know SQL and hadoop for this data science",True
@benjaminarellanogaete711,2020-07-18T23:55:36Z,2,"thanks for the advice, i`ll start learning python right now. the quality of the video would be 3xbetter (at least for me) if you look right to the camera when speaking. idk maybe im weird but i feel it makes a big difference.  thanks again :)",True
@fratzlol,2020-07-10T05:22:36Z,5,"I first learned python when I started programming and switched to R because that's the language my DS course was taught on.

I tried to transition to python in the academia, and it was just painful. cheers",True
