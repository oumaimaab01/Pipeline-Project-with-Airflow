@r1fl3r93,2023-04-28T14:37:42Z,1,"Copying and pasting codes and executing it is a very unique way to learn, currently im doing data science Professional course on Coursera by IBM and they used this technique in Jupyter Notebooks.",True
@skinnysenpai6794,2023-04-26T10:00:49Z,4,"So basically Datatypes Variables work Logical operators if else elif Loops while and for Functions encapsulate and reuseability Basic data structures work tuples dictionary set list Then libraries , pandas, numpy matplotlib, scikit learn Arrays, series, dataframe from numpy Classes and object oriented programming is for later And build projects to renforce learnings,  Also just follow projects on kaggle line by line don't worry about feeling less of and just learn how the project is build. And take it easy on yourself",True

@Eta_Carinae__,2023-01-09T17:05:20Z,2,"Though R is _technically_ a programming language, I think very few people use it for programming. And that's almost ditto for Python, ime. I just think that if you're in a bit of a pinch, actually solving a problem by programming just makes your life so much easier, and I think Python tends to get you to the program you want to write much easier, mainly because it's C-like.",True
@MrViperHiggins,2022-12-14T17:53:20Z,1,Hey Ken great video as always man. Can I ask what are those boards at 2:51 they are awesome!,True

@amospan14,2022-10-11T23:46:51Z,2,Love the jiu jitsu visual analogy to when you feel stuck debugging a coding problem. Have no fear cause likely a developer on stackoverflow has experienced the same problem and solved it. Thank you my man!,True
@hujanair2,2022-09-03T14:25:22Z,0,You are a godsent. I am 31 who wants to go into tech by doing data scientist bootcamp. Are companies still looking for entry level data scientist jobs? Or should i pick up another skill aside from the basics before applying left and right?,True
@syedraza6314,2022-08-08T22:21:43Z,1,"you were super helpful when i emailed you about a year ago just so others know but please don't blow up his inbox lol. anytime a market becomes bloated or saturated you need a remedy its nature i believe. with data science and analytics courses even masters degree being handed out by the dozen, what do you think is the future of DS analytics this whole industry that relies on experts that transform data into insights. What will happen in the next 3-5 years from your standpoint (you're def an expert in area if not one of the top, def up there and you're always objective, only giving more credibility to your opinions). thanks Ken.",True

@salomeshunamon4737,2022-08-03T14:46:18Z,1,"Thanks so much for this video. The link to the youtube for freecodecamp isn't working. I had a question (perhaps for another video)â€” what ""certifications"" (if any) are valuable in the DS space?",True
@mabenba,2022-08-02T11:53:56Z,3,This video is amazing. Thanks for sharing your wisdom.  What I would love to make with python is an automated speed test for my internet that collect band width data every certain amount of time to make a dataset to present a claim to my internet provaider.,True
@jonforsgren7428,2022-08-01T02:10:30Z,1,I train jiu jitsu as well. Blue belt here! Learning Data Science as I found a passion in working with data. If you're ever in Michigan please let me know and come train with us at our gym! I would like to eventually find ways to use data science to come up with interesting projects within the jiu jitsu landscape.,True

@mariopaul6505,2022-07-30T00:17:21Z,11,"A video many have been waiting for!  A Ken Jee classic! I agree that at first, coding ""seems"" hard and challenging.  Once you get started with your first project, you begin to realize how much fun it is! A few well documented personal projects later, you're well on your way to potentially apply for entry level jobs.  Keep grinding everyone!",True
@voyager1996,2022-07-29T22:51:01Z,5,"This is awesome! I'm in my first semester of master's program in Data Science, but I was having a hard time since I come from linguistics background. Now I feel like some clouds have been cleared up. Thank you so much for the video and can't wait to watch your next content! Cheers :)",True

@Glenners,2022-07-29T17:21:01Z,1,"Thanks for the info dude! Just FYI your LEDs are causing that banding. The frequency of the pulse width modulation is lining up with your shutter speed/ frame rate, if you change your shutter speed a bit you could get it to go away (wouldn't be using 180 degree rule anymore but who cares).",True
@diegoariel707,2022-07-29T16:59:04Z,1,Thanks for the video! What are your thoughts regarding the math of data science?,True

@evoguru8089,2022-07-29T14:55:48Z,14,"I often notice myself skipping some basics and hopping onto more advanced models and techniques. However, as elementary, as they may appear at first,Â coding basics always need to come first. The more you know them, the easier itâ€™ll be toÂ grasp more complex structures.",True
