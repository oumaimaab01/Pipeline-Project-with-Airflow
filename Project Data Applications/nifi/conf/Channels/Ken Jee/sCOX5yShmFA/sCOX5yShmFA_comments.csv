@ethxn3587,2024-03-05T02:59:57Z,0,"Hi Ken, when you said you were comparing the rolling averages to the  playing minutes in the ""previous game"" , what does the projection refer to, is it their average across the season?",True
@piyushzope10,2021-03-17T16:08:26Z,3,"Hi, How can we install NBASimulator [ Your GitHub repository ] in conda. As we did the installation of nba_api, it got directly installed. Is this one is different? Also, are there any prerequisites before using jupyter?  But, Thanks for the video, I understood the concept through video just confused about using tools...",True

@ced4030,2021-01-04T12:27:54Z,1,Thanks for posting this! A question; do you happen to have a similar video/method for projecting player ownership within a dfs contest?,True

@KenJee_ds,2019-06-15T15:26:16Z,2,"Hello everyone! Dan, one of my followers, pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable (minutes played) many of the methods that I tested. Obviously, this is not something that you should do. After re-running the analysis with the correct adjustments made, these were my findings.   Just Previous Game Prediction Score:  7.991422567954051 Previous Three Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.937990350926065 Previous Five Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.82599267659377 Previous Ten Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.872496732886791 Previous Three Games Rolling Median Score:  7.233177023501123 Previous Five Games Rolling Median Score:  7.111145383454696 Previous Ten Games Rolling Median Score:  7.079332689005398   It looks like the past 5 game rolling average is actually the best performing of this group.    Linear Model Performance: RMSE =  6.3429443807711765 Random Forest Performance: RMSE =  6.284779430662026 Combined Model Performance: RMSE = 6.276509665369035  As expected, the ensemble model performs the best. It appears that adding the linear component does provide a small amount of lift to the results.

@delt19,2019-05-25T15:53:10Z,1,"Say today's date is j and yesterdays date is j-1; are you using data through j-1 to predict minutes played on date j and for the RMSE calculation? If not, you will be understating the error. Just wondering because it wasn't clear from just glancing at the code you have in your video.",True
@petertaranovich2507,2019-01-18T05:48:37Z,0,"Hi Ken, my name is Peter. I play a bunch of DFS and I do pretty well, but I have a glaring deficiency and it's my lack of programming / statistics skills. I enjoyed the video on NBA minutes. I think I have some ideas that could make your models even better than they already are, and we could both benefit. My email is PeterTaranovich@Gmail.com. Let me know if you have any interest in collaborating. Regardless, it's a great video and I appreciate you posting it.",True
