@leandrogalindo8288,2023-07-10T19:46:25Z,1,"Hello, I'm very interested in purchasing the course, when I saw the video and I tried to get the money to purchase it ASAP, I was only able to get the 78$ today, but now it is only available at its original price, I know it is not really expensive to you guys, but I am from Colombia, so that price really is the monthly minimum wage, not something you can easily afford, do you see it possible to ever put the discount on again, still I think I am going to get it, it's just going to take me a couple months, I'm a college student, so it's not always easy to get the resources inmediatly, still, thank you for your amazing work and generosity, I've had in the back of my mind that I wanna be a data science for a while now, and one of the first videos that made things clearer for me, and encouraged me to start this journey was one of yours",True
@PrairieVenom,2023-07-10T16:53:10Z,1,Thank you! Your hard work and your presence on YouTube has been super motivating for me! I was able to demo my first project to my co-workers. I am so excited to see new things from you! Congrats!,True

@wilsonman8661,2023-06-24T12:06:41Z,2,"Hey, congrats on the courses Ken. Thanks for creating them. :D  Have you read Four Thousand Weeks, by Oliver Burkeman? I'm in the middle of the book now and it's honestly been a bit of a paradigm shift for me.  Since you mentioned feeling guilty about not being able to do ALL the things while creating these courses, I figured I'd suggest yet another something for you to do. üòÇ",True

@jairusmartinez1209,2023-06-23T21:32:06Z,1,"Sold on 3 major things: 1. You made it clear that this is for people with some base of stats/cs  2. This is marketed as a reference manual for fundamentals and real-world application/implementation and not a crash course to becoming a DS 3. 3 courses for $75 and lifetime access  I'm a data analyst that just started an MSDS and for those reasons, along with knowing your content/teaching style/doing your Kaggle walk-thoughs, I think it's safe to say that this deal is a no-brainer.  A reference manual on the ML process, the algorithms, and then the application in industry are great topics to cover.  FYI- I'm not gonna buy these courses to ""learn the skills to become a DS"" but simply as a supplement to enhance my learning/fundamental understanding of DS tools/ML.",True
@uwillnevahno6837,2023-06-23T21:20:25Z,0,"Honestly IDK what to do at this point.  I have a GitHub, I did the Google Data Analytics Cert and I've completed heaps of Coursera and LinedIn Learning content all of which resulted in ZERO recruiters reaching out and ZERO responses to resume submissions.  Oh and most jobs are ""entry-level"" with 3-5 yrs of experience.  Spending another $80 seems pointless.",True
@htctalker983,2023-06-23T20:25:21Z,1,This is great timing! I just started my summer and was looking for a course to do.   Can we expect to see any future limited time sales or will this be the only one?,True
