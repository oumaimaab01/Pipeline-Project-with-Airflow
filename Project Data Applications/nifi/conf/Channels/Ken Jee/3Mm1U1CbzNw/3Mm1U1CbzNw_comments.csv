@onalennathatotaukobong1829,2021-05-27T16:44:31Z,1,"i kinda find it cool, but too intense. I did a bachelors in law, then did a bachelors in business informatics.  I did so much better in my informatics degree but the it was the most taxing and I would shut down and literally quit school a couple of days after projects and exams. I was quite a slow learner, despite my 3.7 gpa. Im just looking for a career that pays a lot where the skills required are not so broad. I feel like accounting could have done the trick. Im about to do an internship as a data analyst, im honestly still not sure about this path and I dont know many ppl as clueless as I am about their interests, after investing so much time in education. Any advice?",True
@neharikajsh,2021-04-26T15:32:17Z,1,"Hi Ken, I am an Computer Engineer and have a bachelor's degree on the same field. Furthermore, I am thinking of pursuing my further Studies in Data Science and I am currently working as a .NET developer(love to code). I found Math, Probability & Statistics interesting during my semesters over the years. So I think it would be good for me to practice with Data Science right? I'd like some of your feedbacks & btw awesome video :)",True

@2JuniorAl,2021-01-19T19:17:16Z,1,"Hi Ken, I am regularly watching your channel now and thanks for lots of great videos. I have recently declared double major on DS. And, my  current fear is that I have encountered lots of data scientists saying that ds requires solid understanding in math. I have already took Calc 1 and 2. However, it was a while ago, so i believe i need to restudy them. And, I still need to take a stats course and linear algebra. So, im currently wondering how strong of math do I need to know if I want to go into the field? Or, how in depth do i need to know of math? For ex, would I need just basic understanding of calculus, stats and linear algebra. Or, do I need to know them solidly by knowing good enough to take ‚Äúhonors‚Äù or ‚Äúhigher‚Äù courses in that I can implement them however I want and solve bunch of Olympiad level questions?   Also, would it be okay for me to learn math through online courses or books to acquire skills, or do I need to take courses from a college in order to show that I have taken courses?    Thank you as always and rly hope that you can give me some insights on these.",True

@AirmanKolberg,2021-01-04T17:33:08Z,1,"My biggest hurtle seems to be the degree.  TL;DR - Due to the Department of Veteran Affairs, I effectively can no longer get a Bachelor‚Äôs in the U.S. (without first having tens of thousands, and at that point I could transfer my first 109 credits), so I‚Äôve been learning a lot of the math on the side.  Programming I‚Äôve been doing since I was a child, but I‚Äôve still a lot to learn to become a data scientist in other aspects.  Anyone who may know, I‚Äôm intrigued, in your experience, approximately what percentage of data scientists do you know who hold no degree?  I imagine not a lot.  But then again, I‚Äôd finish my degree if I could, too.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",True

@Chutneybhai,2020-07-10T16:59:49Z,10,"Hi Ken, I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, I‚Äôm getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I don‚Äôt remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and they‚Äôre open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics.   Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?",True

@donnelly5757,2019-11-11T01:02:04Z,2,"Yes, data science is right for me in probably more ways than the number of roommates I've had the last 7 years, which is too many! lol  However, like you said in one of your comments below, getting into the field ASAP through being a data analyst would probably be a better bet for someone in my situation who is severely underemployed, has loads of debt, and wants to have a better quality of life. In all honesty, I would be quite content with a data analyst role. I would see it as a stepping stone and an opportunity to improve in all areas in life. I see becoming a data scientist with an emphasis on big data engineering or machine learning engineering as long term goals and becoming a data analyst as more of a short term goal (18-24 months), with luck and or strategic networking maybe 12-15 months.",True
@BiancaAguglia,2019-08-31T22:11:39Z,73,"Your advice is spot on:  1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. üòÅ)  2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem. Data scientists are supposed to be really good at problem solving. Being a data scientist who's asking for help all the time kind of undermines the purpose of being a data scientist. üòâ  3. learn the math (I actually believe that most people have the ability to understand the math but, most have been taught math in a way that's not relevant enough nor interesting enough to them. When done right, I can't see how anyone can not love math.) 4. learn coding 5. tell great stories   Also, a quote I heard recently, makes a nice addition: ""For some, data science is an opportunity. For me, data science is a passion."" üòä When you go into the field for the right reasons, you'll do whatever it takes to get great at it.   I enjoyed watching this video.

The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali.    If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters.   What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap.  great vid btw!",True
