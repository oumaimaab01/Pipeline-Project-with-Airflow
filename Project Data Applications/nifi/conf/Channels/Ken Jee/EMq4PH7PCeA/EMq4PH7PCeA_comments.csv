@NotYowBusiness,2021-04-23T14:33:11Z,1,"Hi Ken - new subscriber here. Thank you so much for your words of wisdom. Was wondering if you'd have advice for someone in my situation:   I'm currently a Data Analyst in a social media marketing agency and am looking to do an advanced degree in Data Science. Unfortunately, my non-technical background (I'm a liberal arts major who happens to be good at Math) means that I don't have the prerequisite undergraduate courses needed for Masters degrees in Data Science.  However, I fit the profile of some Masters in Business Analytics/Management Analytics degrees. These courses combine business concepts with coding components, with introductory overviews into ML & AI, but they're not deep, technical specializations. Was wondering if you'd say it would be a relatively smooth journey from a Business Analytics Masters degree to an eventual Data Scientist role?",True
