@7enso,2020-07-08T16:26:36Z,2,"One thing I would add in here, I've just had a look through his code and one criticism I would have would be around his use of Oversampling. He does this before he splits his data into the test and train set which causes data leakage (Not as much as a naive upsampling method but since nearest neighbours is being used, some leakage is happening meaning it's generalisability beyond this dataset may be limited) - just thought that would be helpful for anyone using oversampling methods.",True
