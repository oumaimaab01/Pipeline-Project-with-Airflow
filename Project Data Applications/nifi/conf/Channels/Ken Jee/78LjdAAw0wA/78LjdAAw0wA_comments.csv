@KenJee_ds,2020-11-09T19:13:14Z,3,Feel free to pose questions in the comment section here as well! Will do my best to get to them all!,True
@joserubio3036,2020-12-04T14:50:08Z,1,"would you recommend the new macbooks for data science? Im looking for a new laptop which a long battery life and lightweight, any recommendation here?",True
@brendali5803,2020-11-20T05:56:07Z,0,"Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects.   Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it.  However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement.  Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community. TOC2 will make it much easier.",True

@rahulahuja1412,2020-11-17T04:45:06Z,1,Very helpful session. Looking forward to more of these. Thanks. P.S. The questions were visible well enough  @ 720p. And it was good that you made them visible.,True
@wilsonman8661,2020-11-14T20:56:36Z,2,"This comment stood out to me the most: ""Maybe it's more about the critical mass of what you create than the growth of the videos"" (39:46). To me, it speaks to cultivating internal motivations, having an internal locus of control and understanding that above all else, you must do the work.  (And thanks for your answer to my questions, Ken. I can certainly appreciate the wisdom in planning in broad strokes and letting life fill in the details.)",True
