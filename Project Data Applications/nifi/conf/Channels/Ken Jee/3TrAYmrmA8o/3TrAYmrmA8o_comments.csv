@a_vickyp8360,2021-03-15T01:43:29Z,1,"#59: Seriously 52 BOOKS!! What the !!!!ðŸ“š That's crazy, you are my hero! As always is really nice to hear your reviews, I must confess I'm not good at reading, so Audible is becoming my best friend, I'm now hearing Designing your life, and is a book that is changing my life.  Also on paper, I'm on Mathletics, I'm taking notes, I hope to read at least the nine that you recommended!  #66daysofdata",True

@Limex1554,2020-06-24T09:01:10Z,1,"Hi, I've heard also some negative information about this book ""Why we sleep"". I haven't read it yet by myself (but I want to do it soon), but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable, like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than 8h (something like this). I think this makes sense, because just like diet, everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell. Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it. Your channel is great anyway, keep up with the solid work!",True
@kevintran314,2020-06-21T03:54:58Z,2,"Super helpful video/links! Thank you so much for sharing. I finished ""The One Thing"" last week and was super happy with it! Definitely my preferred type of book! I just wanted to know where you found these books? Were they recommendations from colleagues or possibly a list of books found on a website? Also, if you had any recommendations on books to learn more about statistics, I would love to hear about them! I took statistics in undergrad (which was a few years ago) and am in the middle of a career change and would like to brush up on the theories and the essentials for data analytics/data science!",True
