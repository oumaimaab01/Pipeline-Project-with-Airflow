Due to pandemic I had to close my business and am looking for opportunities in data science. I have completed few courses including the zero to mastery course by Daniel bourke which helped me create a lot of interest in this field. I am hoping to relate data science with manufacturing. Can you advise me about the same. Is it possible to find a job in data science as I am from a different educational background?",True

I studied industrial engineer and I am interested on it but i ask it because of the needed time, average, to become a good data scientist.  Greetings",True
@betosouza2490,2020-08-01T15:20:47Z,1,"Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on ""Where"" to start learning. But, what you talked about was ""How to learn"". I mean, the advices were ""No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects"" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages.   Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science.   What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like ""Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with..."" I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol.  Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job? I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step?  Thank you for your videos, they made me like Data Science even more, even when I don't understand almost nothing about this world.  Wish you success and waiting to see more videos. If not about my request, well, Data Science is already enough for me to follow the channel.",True

@sama.7363,2020-07-24T16:36:31Z,1,Great channel! Linked & Subscribed!   Do you have books recommendations for the ML concepts? Most books I found explain how to code but I'm more interested in the math & stats behind those concepts.  Thank you,True

@gormikayelyan9793,2020-07-13T02:45:21Z,1,"Given that I do not work full time current, do you think it would be feasible for me to spend 6-5 hours a day (in 1.5-2hr blocks) learning various Data Science building blocks / projects. I did spend most of my time studying/sitting in lectures back in university, however, not having done that recently may feel a little overwhelming if I do decide to spend that much time on learning again. P.S. I am enrolled in Springboard Data Science Career Track.",True
@livelierfellow,2020-07-09T22:08:24Z,1,"Hey Ken,  I'm gearing up to apply for an online master's in DS.  I have a bachelor's in math and an MS in stats from a decade ago that I ended up not really using (long story).  I've started learning python and I'm not completely sucking at it so I feel like I'm on the right track but my math skills are obviously pretty rusty.  Any idea what kind of math I should brush up on to prepare?    The program itself hasn't even started, UT Austin is still putting it together and planning on accepting applications in the next few months.  I was hoping to just get a little ahead of the curve.",True

@syedfaizanahmed6663,2020-07-04T03:34:47Z,1,Brilliant work as always. Is it true that there are no datascience jobs and internships for freshers that are recently graduated from college or do they need some work experience in order to get a job. Does being a SWE in a big tech company adds as a advantage to get a job or do we have to have datascience domain experience only to get a job in FANG companies. Do reply.,True

I've started a data science course on udemy and I would like to know if there's any platform that you know of that would help me practise the concepts I've learned. Let's say I just finished regression, and I want to practice some problems on regression, where should I go.  Also, would it be possible for you to make a Kaggle tutorial that would help us familiarise ourselves with the website? Like I tried to get on Kaggle and found myself lost and everything looked very high profile and I didn't know where to start as a beginner",True

My number one tip is to go through GitHub and search by keyword for projects that interest you. From there, you can find people's scripts and run them chunk by chunk. This way you're learning from people that have a good coding foundation. This is one of the methods I used to learn R.",True

@DataProfessor,2020-07-03T16:56:39Z,1,"Thanks for another great video, Ken! The video editing and transitions are awesome! I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource, as you said, nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource. Because the thing is, different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics. Really like the ""rinse and repeat"" part, learning data science is indeed a never-ending iteration loop.",True
