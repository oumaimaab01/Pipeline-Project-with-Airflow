@owlcatxx,2021-01-06T18:26:56Z,1,"Hi Ken, helpful video as always, thank you! One thing I wanted to touch on was the example around 4:00 about weight loss. Generally, going from fewer skills to more skills is desirable, but going from ""fat"" aka something negative to ""skinny"" aka an admirable goal...just isn't universal, and it can be unhelpful to present it as such. A more constructive way to present this example could be about taking care of one's health, whatever that looks like for different people. It's my impression that Data Science as a field is trying to be more inclusive, and I believe weight inclusivity needs to be part of that. Thanks for reading if you did!",True

@devanshverma5395,2020-09-12T06:15:46Z,3,"Hey ken, I resonated very closely with you on the last point of 'focusing on one imp thing' as for a couple of months i was learning data analytics (sql/tableau/excel etc) and ml and dl(Nlp/Cv) all at same time and was going nowhere even after putting atleast 10hrs everyday. This last point made me realize how important it is to focus on one thing at time. Now i'm going to start with data analytics,find a job and build up from there. Again,thanks Ken",True
@hardikkamboj3528,2020-09-12T05:58:06Z,1,"Wow...look at those handwritten checklists / notes...the clocks with different time zones...amazing.. Thanks ken for this video, what worked for me is spirituality (Yes I am an Indian), its just enjoying the present moment, and being in the present, that's it....You can't describe in words what sprirtuality does to you, but its just watching the things happening around you, and not being affected by them ( Karma Yoga as it is written in Bhagwat Geeta)",True
@alaknandaagarwal8431,2020-09-12T05:39:05Z,1,"Hi Ken, nice video. I really liked the last tip, I've been concious that focusing on one thing could bring in way more results than juggling too may at once. However, I have this irrational fear that I'll lose out on time I could be using to do all of those other things, which is why everything is always top of the priority list.",True

The pillar of celebrating your successes really spoke to me because I'm in the midst of interviews for internships and after passing some of the initial rounds, I shared my hard work with my supportive friends and this motivated me to study even harder for the final rounds of those interviews.

@samirz7,2020-09-11T19:20:11Z,4,"""Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn"" is great advise...another great video !  I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner.   I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called ""How To Learn Data Science Smartly?"" that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try  to learn each aspect of data science separately, but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering.",True
@larigiba,2020-09-11T18:55:47Z,1,"It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically! Thank you a lot for sharing this; about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done. I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!)  I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time.  When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this ""way of thinking"" from, but it was very inspiring to me. Even if you (as in ""you"" personally) do not feel that you have achieved ""that"" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done ""average"" or ""somewhat well"", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on.  I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)",True
@theoutlet9300,2020-09-11T18:41:51Z,1,one thing i started a few days ago and has helped me a lot is I write down goal for my next day and accomplish atleast one thing early in the morning. this gives me a headstart and once i start the process of completing my goals it becomes significantly easier to fulfill them.,True

@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2020-09-11T18:21:53Z,4,"I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention:  1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity.  The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have ""7 habits of highly successful people"".   Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;)  Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.  And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many ""YES!!"" I've shouted when marking one ;)  PS: #66daysofdata If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your #66daysofdata ... you might be doing more than 66 of them, and good days they might be just saying ;) (I assume this should count for your challenge in that case). :) PS2: Haven't told you that before, but it seems we have something in common! -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnqZl_blT7E :P",True
