@BiancaAguglia,2019-09-04T21:57:31Z,2,"Great job. I like seeing the project end-to-end. üòä I have avoided web scraping because I'm still unclear on when it's OK to do it and when it's not (and I'm the kind of person who avoids at all costs doing something that might get me in trouble. üòÅ) I've read quite a few robots.txt files and many of them specifically disallow crawlers other than the usual search engines, yet some people feel comfortable scraping those sites.    Do you have any guidelines for deciding when it is OK to scrape and when it isn't?",True
