@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2020-08-24T14:21:59Z,0,"I put this message here, since it's your last video. I was wondering if you will do a video on the following subject:  How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people, the kind that are helpful and, likewise, how can a newbie, like me, make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle. And in general, what are the best ways to interact on the platform.  I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example).  Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there. ( I fully admit that it looks a bit intimidating at first sight :) ).  In any case, thanks for your youtubes videos :)",True

@kelline1979,2020-08-22T00:09:23Z,1,"Hi Ken, I saw your course in it as i had already bought a one year package. as my boot camp starts in a fortnight, i am desperate for time to get my machine leaning code done in kaggle datasets. i will go through your course after the bootcamp. i am currently undergoing kaggle mini-courses to get going. the new visualisation course in 365 also i on-holding it, lol. i watch your titanin walkthrough, several times, its great. but it is too high level for us beginners. i am trying the easier one on estonia. i wonder if you could do something like titanic on a much simplier dataset, for those really beginners out there and me. i like your voice, tone, speed. its really easy to understand. i like 365, its guide learners very well. but then we need more practise on datasets, there is where kaggle comes in. but its overwhelming for beginners too. there are too much to learn to roam around in kaggle, so i took the mini-course to learn how to get its data, and to submit. Thanks for the contents. i watch everyone of it",True

It is very good to see that you really try to create as much value as possible! I think this course will really benefit a lot of people.   Btw: If a hypothetical person would be in the hypothetical position that they already have their portfolio set up and basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door, especially for more of a machine learning engineering, rather than DS role, do you think this course would be a good fit?
