@johnginos6520,2020-07-15T14:26:32Z,1,"What do you recommend doing for a review of the interpretability of project outcomes. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm working on an econometrics project on my own, what‚Äôs the best place or way to review that I‚Äôm drawing the correct conclusions from my results? A lot of data science online sources simply take you through the code and the outputs but don‚Äôt go into how to make sure you‚Äôre drawing all conclusions from the model.",True
@checkingari,2020-07-15T05:15:13Z,1,"Another nice video.  Ken, I have a question here. Which one is better, do we have to put one project in one repository or do we put several projects in one repository? For instance, this repository is a repository for the projects that I have done by taking a dataset from Kaggle.   Thank you Ken",True

@arthurmlcc,2020-07-13T23:30:19Z,2,Hey ken! Loving the series! I wanted to make a suggestion since I don't have a decent portfolio yet to submit it for your analysis. I think you should make a series solving actual data science tasks and problems that Data Scientists face daily. I think it would be very innovative and reaaaaally helpfull to beginners like me.
