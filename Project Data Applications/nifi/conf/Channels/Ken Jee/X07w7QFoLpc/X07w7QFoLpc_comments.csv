@truthdfg,2023-05-15T23:00:05Z,1,My kid is going to choose Data science &AI at college but I'm afraid there aren't going to be enough jobs for juniors by the time my kid graduates.What do you think of it? Could you share your opinion on this?,True
@rajnishadhikari9280,2023-04-27T13:51:06Z,0,hello sir I am going to apply for junior data scientist position. so by reading the description can you suggest me what sorts of project should I need to do.,True

@mohamadajan1899,2023-04-13T22:46:02Z,2,"Hi Ken.  Thanks for this great video.  I am planning to study computer science.  But since the launch of chatgpt and all the other AI tools, I've only heard of programmers being replaced.  Should I change my mind about computer science or just ignore all this talk?",True

@shivamsahil3660,2023-04-09T03:50:37Z,1,I still think it's overrated. Not sure but my experience writing with AI has been the same. Sure it helps and increases your efficiency in lots of use cases but when building end to end projects relying on AI especially in software dev is just not going to work.  I used to spend 2 hours on debugging but when AI loses it I spend more than a day debugging where it messed up,True
@solaawodiya7360,2023-04-08T21:47:19Z,3,Honestly I got demotivated learning Data Science because of AI that I stopped for 2 months but your video gave me hope on how I can actually speed up my learning and do more using these tools. Thanks a lot man üëèüèæ‚ù§,True
@beatsbytex,2023-04-07T04:10:03Z,0,"I tried chat gpt this week, it helped me come up with a machine learning algorithm that I was too afraid to dive into. I could have done it without chatgpt but it‚Äôs extremely faster than googling. It got stuck once or twice but rewording my question usually worked for it.",True
@Rex_793,2023-04-07T03:53:52Z,2,Ken! You should do a podcast with some of your friends about this topic -- maybe Tina since she also released a video with similar vibes. Would love a long form discussion about this pivotal moment.,True

@mynewOTAKU,2023-04-06T18:04:15Z,3,"Starting my master's degree in computer science with data analytics in September.... a little nervous I'll be obsolete by the time I graduate! Won't give up, but it is unnerving all the same. And I'll incorporate AI where I can to be effective.",True
@nwsounds419,2023-04-06T16:51:15Z,7,"My opinion for people is if you have the choice, plan for a job that uses AI as a tool rather than something that it can automate, atleast for now. This is a new technological era that we don't have answers to just critical rational thought with some logical implication and illogical creativeness to prepare for all scenarios. Better or for worse, no one really knows the best plan, I personally say join them and make friends with them in a sense",True
