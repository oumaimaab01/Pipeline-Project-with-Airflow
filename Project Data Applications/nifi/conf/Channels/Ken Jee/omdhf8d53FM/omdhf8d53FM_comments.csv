@flawedlogic342,2020-09-20T18:11:47Z,1,Awesome Video Ken!,True
@citormussa,2020-09-19T13:41:49Z,1,"Sorry for my second comment and request in the same video, but it would be very nice if you could do a video on the possibilities of transitioning to Data Science coming from a social sciences background beyond economics (sociology, anthropology, history and/or any field that requires analytical thinking and may involve qualitative research). I'm thinking either of a research context (ex masters or PhD students) or simply BS/BA graduates. Thank you again.",True
@citormussa,2020-09-19T13:35:50Z,3,"Congratulations for expanding your channel's scope beyond the US, Ken Jee. You are doing an amazing job. I'd like to thank you in the name of non-US to-be data scientists and ask you, if possible and convenient, to do a video on making it to the Data Science field in the Brazilian context, if it is the case that you already know any successful Brazilian data scientist. Best wishes.",True
@larigiba,2020-09-18T10:27:19Z,4,"Great interview! As someone from Europe I am particularly interested in the entire process outside of the US, since currently there is not a lot of information on this topic online. One small note; at some points in the video, especially when the audio of you talking is a bit low, the music makes it a bit more difficult to follow along. Still an awesome discussion tho! :)",True
@namanjaswani8925,2020-09-17T10:07:32Z,2,"Really good interview Ken ! Just one suggestion as audience: Do not add background music, it is annoying",True
@himadrijoshi3745,2020-09-17T07:32:58Z,2,Thanks Ken Jee for bringing Vijay to your channel. Vijay was absolutely inspiring. It's very motivating for students like me who aspire to work in the field of Data Science. Thank you ðŸ’™,True
@anilsiddabathula3158,2020-09-17T06:00:48Z,2,"That's so cool...!  I wanna ask you one question K'Jee, from india how many views you will get in your total views ?",True

@arujbudhraja,2020-09-16T21:07:59Z,2,"Amazing Ken. Thank you for bringing to us such Data Experts who share their story.  Just want to let you know, these are highly inspirational and moving. Thank you. Really.",True
@HqComphelpqH,2020-09-16T20:18:47Z,2,"Just found your channel a few days ago and absolutely love your content! I watched your Data Science Project from sctach series and found it very beneficial. I was wondering if you could make a video targeted at beginners as to what kind of EDA we should be doing depending on our data, maybe explain some of the statistics knowledge needed when picking features to use in models etc (not necessarily how to create plots as you did this in your EDA episode of the ds project series). Thanks for putting out content this useful for free, keep it up man",True
@anuragsrivastava481,2020-09-16T19:10:38Z,2,Thanks for sharing this interview ken. I have done my masters in electronics and communication. I definitely feel motivated after watching this interview.,True
@AndrewMoMoney,2020-09-16T18:13:55Z,7,"Great to have an influential speaker here! Incredible diversity in your interviews, thanks for the great content as always Ken :)",True

@thinamG,2020-09-16T16:22:05Z,3,"Consistency and believing the process is the most important take away from here :) Thank you so much, Ken. It's inspiring and encouraging.",True
@Garcia-elf,2020-09-16T15:57:28Z,6,How about a video of making the transition from graduate school in the life sciences to data science. I know you can get data science certificates. What steps should people with PhDs not in CS (eg biology/genomics) take while theyâ€™re in grad school?,True
