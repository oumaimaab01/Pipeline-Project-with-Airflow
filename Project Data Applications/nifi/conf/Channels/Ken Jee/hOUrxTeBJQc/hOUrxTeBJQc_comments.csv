I haven't yet worked on, let's say, real projects, except for some Kaggle practice and reading. A few days ago, I set out to create a substantial project involving extracting valuable insights from the remote job market, and I'm finding it quite challenging to locate suitable data sources. I mean, I'm investing a lot of time exploring techniques to attempt scraping LinkedIn, for example, but it hasn't been yielding any results so far. I would appreciate any suggestions :)",True
@TheProblembaer2,2023-04-07T21:22:19Z,1,"Hey one thing I missed: the right learning succession. You need to know your basics and that is calc 1-3 or in Europe mostly analysis 1 and 2. Linear algebra.

It showed that a rat will drown in 15 or so minutes if left unattended, but if you save the rat right as it submerges,, and put it back in the water, it'll keep swimming for another 60+ hours without drowning.

@mwredfern,2022-03-06T19:15:27Z,1,"You always hear it from seasoned data scientists; just start. But where - right? My advice 1)do small projects. 2)complete a project. 3)literally, rewrite a project you find an example for on YouTube or a GitHub. Literally, type the solution out word for word. This will allow you to feel the data science flowing through your fingers. Then go back and modify the project you just built. Modify it just enough to change the results. Now you feel the data science even more. Your confidence just went through the roof.   Like he said, learn just enough.  Cause the reality is that you‚Äôll only use 1/10th of what you learned. At least at the beginning. No one is going to make you a lead out the door. If they do, quit or turn down the job.   Also and most important, realize a data scientist in IT is not the same data scientist in Finance. I‚Äôm a SQL SME in accounting and finance. but if I hang out with IT SQL SME‚Äôs, he‚Äôs from mars and I‚Äôm from Jupiter. We speak SQL but we use SQL for different goals. Data scientists are the same.   Don‚Äôt get distracted. You‚Äôll find your place. Just keep DSing.",True

@byoutekinaeiyuu,2021-04-23T14:19:49Z,2,"I'd personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic).   As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too.   Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it's not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it's not that important in what order I did it...   Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice.   Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don't know how long it will take you (coz it's new to you and you don't know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don't even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don't get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress.  Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning & AI specialists.   Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...)   So yeah, some comments on Data Science learning from someone who has been learning it for about 6 months ;)",True
@jamesscouten2966,2021-04-23T14:11:35Z,1,The most refreshing thing about your videos is the honesty.  Almost as much as the advise.   That and seeing your dad make Cameos ü§£,True
@thinamG,2021-04-23T14:07:03Z,11,"Yeah, The community helped me to create the learning habit. Thank you so much, Ken.",True
@lloyddarnel3368,2021-04-23T13:50:37Z,1,"Great video as always, Ken! & definitely the right choice :D @1:28",True
@codingcrashkurse6429,2021-04-23T13:49:17Z,3,"Hey Ken, have you ever thought on making a video on what is important when you are in a data science role already. Would be quite interesting for me to hear your opinion. I sometimes do not know if I should dive VERY deep into some specific topics or just use my freetime to learn something somewhat related. For example I love working with REST Apis and even some Vue Frontend stuff which will not make me a better data scientist, but are also fun... Since I am also a content creator I something think the same way about creating videos. What¬¥s your opinion?",True
@colekole4012,2021-04-23T13:48:44Z,2,Is a masters needed because I am very tired of school?üòÇ,True
@fratzlol,2021-04-23T13:41:43Z,4,Mistake nr 8 : data leakage between your training and testing sets. I saw that being made by an experienced data scientist in my first job. It was ignored and a 85% precision/recall score was announced to management.,True
@archismandas8178,2021-04-23T13:40:06Z,1,Hi! I like watching your videos. Love and support from India ‚ô•Ô∏è There's some thing in particular that I'd like to ask.  1) It's been some time since I completed MySQL course. However i have gone through the videos a few times but still I am not able to gain the confidence of saying that I know SQL.  What do you suggest here?  2) Practical knowledge is very important and I am unable to get that. I have a dataset. I make up problem statements in my mind and try solving it. But that is clearly not helping at all. So can you suggest me some places where I can apply the knowledge of Sql that I gained through the course?   Course I took: 365 Data Science.,True
@DatascienceConcepts,2021-04-23T13:37:19Z,4,Excellent Insights! I totally agree with the point of not applying your knowledge and focusing only on theory as being one of the biggest hurdle for someone new in the field.,True
@shrutijain1628,2021-04-23T13:27:12Z,2,Those are spot on . These are few of the mistake I made when I was starting,True
@bianchialex,2021-04-23T13:19:34Z,3,"Mistake I personally made,  I didn't learn enough math. And I thought that I could brute force my way through a data science course with some hodgepodge math. I think really getting that foundation is pretty important and it can be done in a singular course, it doesn't have to be a year of university math classes",True
