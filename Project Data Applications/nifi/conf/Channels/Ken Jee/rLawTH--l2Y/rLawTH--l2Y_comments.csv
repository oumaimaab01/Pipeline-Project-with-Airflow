@Evan_242,2020-09-11T16:58:06Z,1,"Hello there! How did Deepak create a portfolio like this? It's awesome! I already have a github and LinkedIn detailed but not a portfolio, it's gorgeous and very attractive. I really want to explore more in depth this option :) especially because I'm searching for a job right now. Nice video BTW, I just discovered you, you really seems a nice guy.",True
@surajbolisetty6586,2020-09-09T09:43:19Z,1,"Hey Ken, Can you make a video on a project, where you predict the number of views you'll get in a week/month for that video? Also thank you for such amazing content. Much needed ðŸ˜ƒ",True
@osoyoki,2020-09-08T19:13:55Z,2,"Hey Ken, I've not yet watched the full video (although I'm sure it will be super helpful), but I wanna tell you that you could consider reviewing portfolios of your latest emails, because otherwise the person who sent you the portfolio won't get that much value (since in 6 months time he will have probably gotten a job). It's just a suggestion (I haven't sent you mine so I don't have personal interests).",True
@moppu4,2020-09-08T15:35:17Z,2,"Hey Ken, great video as usual!   I just thought I would mention, if you add a ' smile' in the Amazon affiliates link, it will take people to Amazon smile instead, where Amazon pay an additional 0.5% to a chosen charity for no extra cost :)",True
