@anubhavgoyal3211,2021-06-06T17:56:29Z,3,Well explained! ThankuðŸ˜„,True
@SydneyRox1,2021-03-27T14:47:40Z,3,The vest pun is underrated ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ,True
@piyushzope10,2021-02-08T08:32:18Z,8,Now I have got a clear idea about the difference. The explanation is very specific and well explained.,True
@a_vickyp8360,2021-01-19T03:15:48Z,6,"#15: The chart in the video is super helpful. When I was starting learning about DS all the terms were tangled in my head. A lot to understand and study, for me, it's still tricky were to specialize the knowledge. I do like ML, but AI will be the future! #66daysofdata",True
@minhhoangnguyen6870,2021-01-04T08:30:06Z,1,"Sorry bro, ML is totally different with DS, ML just uses DS to manipulate data but ML and DS are not the same and ML is not a part of DS, ok -_-",True
@skinnyboystudios9722,2020-12-20T05:43:09Z,2,"Sorry but your definition is totally misleading because Artificial Intelligence is not a field of data science neither machine learning but machine learning is a subset of AI and AI is a subset Computer Science. It has been so since 1956 and has never changed. People who develop AI algorithms are computer scientists not data scientists.   Just like Mathematics is not a subset of Physics, yes Data Scientists use lot of ML to solve problems but they do not generally study AI like computer scientist do. Just like physicists uses math but they do not study math like mathematicians do. You can also say so about medical professionals when comparing them to biologists.  Thanks... Just wanted to highlight",True
@vincentcremer4235,2020-11-14T09:42:13Z,3,"If youre aiming at becoming a machine learning/ ai engineer.. Do you think that its a good idea to work as a data scientist, without spending much time on machine learning, at first and than specialize on these subjects? i work as a data analyst rigth now (for a short time).",True
@anvayawalgaonkar4119,2020-11-07T07:33:21Z,3,Hey Ken extremely nice video ..got an offer from essex university for msc in applied Data Science and also got a offer from stirling university for msc in Ai and AI with business strategy from Aston University...Just confused which field to choose as a career option?,True
@davidg8675,2020-11-05T05:01:14Z,0,3:39  I know this video is over 1 1/2 years old but this opinion sounds kinda odd now when you think of what GPT-3 is already capable to do. Especially if you consider it did only basic training till now :D,True
@alexcastillo8507,2020-10-21T03:10:53Z,2,Iâ€™ve been reading quite a few articles to try to figure out the relationship between these terms. Thank you for putting in plain English :),True
@biggideal,2020-07-18T18:41:03Z,4,"Your channel is a gold mine for me, keep it up!",True
@softwaremaking,2019-08-20T14:04:45Z,2,What is the relation of deep learning and data science? And how data science is helping AI in day to day life ?,True
