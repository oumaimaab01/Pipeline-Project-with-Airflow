@dodjicohovi4097,2020-03-14T15:17:54Z,0,Hey Jee prop to you. I love using google colab! Though sometimes it gets me scratching my head because they are things you have to do google way. Like imshow that I have to spend all day to figure it out. My only concern using colab is that privacy with google. Some of my data that I would like to use for practice are work related. So I am not sure if it’s private enough. What’s your take?,True
