@KenJee_ds,2020-04-13T13:50:12Z,21,"Hi Everyone - Thanks for watching! I have gotten awesome feedback thus far on this series. Again, my focus here is to show that data science is an iterative process. You will constantly find bugs, errors, and make mistakes. You will also have to work through them and seek to understand them. I would love to hear about some of the problems errors or bugs you faced that you ended up figuring out in the comments section!",True

@brenttrek,2023-09-07T14:26:25Z,0,"I've been slowly following along using data I was able to build a scraper for in my local real estate market. I think I have understood the process of everything to this point, but now that we are getting into making sense of the data, this is where I need to spend time learning what a lot of this means. I just got to the cross_val_score and I can't make heads or tails of what I'm looking at after reading a few brief reference sheets and articles.",True
@eddiebelzebuth,2023-05-05T15:50:20Z,0,"Once again, great stuff. Quick question though (newbie here)... how come you didn't scale X_train and X_test prior to fitting your models? Or a more general question would be ""Do you typically scale your X_train and X_test prior to fitting the data to your models?"" I am primarily referring to non-tree models, like linear regression and lasso in this case. Thanks!",True
@yadali4833,2023-04-11T13:09:18Z,1,"Thanks, this was a great series. One question I have is when you do the get_dummies, you are left with hundreds of columns, but when you productionize your model later on, would someone have to sit and fill hundreds of cells as data-in of your model? sorry if I am missing something obvious I am new to data science",True
@jadenredhair126,2023-03-19T10:10:44Z,0,Very awesome playlist! Ken you‚Äôre giving people such a valuable resource. I took an intro data science class at Stanford and they literally teach everything you just went through but in 10 weeks! From data scraping to initial visualization and even model selection. We used Google Colab to code in and imo Colab works very well and is integrated with Google Drive so file sharing is easier for newcomers. I‚Äôm pointing anybody that wants to learn data science straight to you from now on!,True

@Elitexemnas,2022-12-18T01:01:31Z,1,"Hi Ken, I am late to the party in both this video and data science in general, but I'm hoping to teach myself enough to make a career pivot into data science (I'd be happy to take a job as a data analyst at this point). From the perspective of someone that has done two or three ""data analysis"" projects on Kaggle (that were really just really sloppy jobs at cleaning and EDA) being able to go on the journey from start to finish with someone that is an actual professional leaves me more appreciative than I can possible articulate. Thanks for the videos",True
@konstantinostzaferis5318,2022-08-23T22:54:42Z,2,Wouldn't it be more robust if you scaled the data before making a model?? There are a lot of columns that have different ranges of values so wouldn't scaling be better before the ML part! Great video;,True
@bhartikindra1191,2022-05-27T09:51:55Z,0,Has anyone reproduced the results? I did it but I am getting some different results. Anyone up for discussion?,True
@rogerod3,2022-05-13T21:26:19Z,2,"Amazing series, even now in 2022, as a new person in the area of data science this has been really helpful because I was really struggling with how to begin a data science project. Thank you for the content.  BTW, I don't know if you are aware of this now on 2022, but you can use #%% on a spyder script to execute portions of code like if it was a Jupyter notebook with shift + enter, I think is a little more efficient than highlight the code and do F5. Just in case you are not aware of this, although I think it all comes down to personal preference.   Sorry if my grammar is weird, I'm not an English native lol.",True

@xCoolguy101x,2021-09-02T02:34:13Z,0,"Hi Ken,  Great videos as always. I followed this one until 12:07. I am seeing 1.000 for R-squared and 0 for all P-values. Back in part 2, when doing the scraper I had to cut the numbers down to 250 because the process kept disconnecting. During data cleaning that number was cut down to 38. Although the numbers were vastly different compared to yours, I was able to work with it because it still produced all of the insightful analysis. Now I'm unsure if I should continue because both R-squared and P-values look weird",True
@hokapokas,2021-06-20T17:47:41Z,1,"Hi Ken, i love the way you are making the videos for the entire DS process. I would like to add a point for this video where I suggest if you have spent the feature selection process Or criterias to add more values to model and this video. Just my 2 cents for the video. It's good work done. Keep going. All the best",True

@ruizhang9615,2020-07-10T16:47:37Z,1,"Another question is that, in my data, the multiple linear regression performs fairly well with the training data (use cross validation) but really bad on test data, is that caused by over-fitting?  For Lasso and Random Forest, it's fine",True
@ruizhang9615,2020-07-10T16:39:12Z,1,"Hi Ken, thank you for the tutorial, I have followed along from the beginning until here, I must admit that the most fun and useful part is to watching you got stuck by something and went through debugging.   I have a question for dealing with missing data, in this example you consider ""-1"" for most categorical variables as a ""new"" category (by using dummies that's what it is in my understanding),  wouldn't it better to replace them with other forms or try to predict them using available values? It'd be great if you can share some insights on that. Thanks so much, please keep it up.",True

So i m following your series (which is just so helpfull), and i tried to make some kind of a different approach without getting too far. I m making the same project, but instead of predicting the salary, i m predicting the ""skills"" required . Its about values from 0 to 3 : no degree/years of experience : 0, Bachelor : 1, Master : 2 and PhD : 3. Everything seem to work well until now. I made the linear regression model using sklearn and the result of the cross validation is extremely high beside the result i should have ([0:3]).

@iliasmokas2373,2020-04-30T11:53:49Z,3,"I was also wondering, for the regression, since you use dummies, shouldn't you throw the base level of the categorical variables to solve any multicollinearity issues?",True
