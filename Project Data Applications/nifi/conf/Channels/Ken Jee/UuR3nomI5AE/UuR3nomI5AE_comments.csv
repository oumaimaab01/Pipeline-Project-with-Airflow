@surajviswakarma254,2020-08-07T20:02:28Z,2,"Hello sir,  I regularly go through your videos on data science. As you said you follow some precoded template (coding) for most of the projects.   Rather than the GitHub code. Could you please share some  of your advanced codes for Data science projects (python).   Thank You",True

@johnpickwick407,2020-08-05T12:18:57Z,1,"@Ken Jee Hey Ken, I'm 30 and i'm considering really getting into data science and machine learning after going through the field on and off over the last couple of years. Would you say it's pretty late for me to get into the field? Can you suggest ways that late-comers into the field might find an edge for themselves? What would you say or advise as an employer or someone hiring new data scientists? What would make an older applicant/late-comer more of an attractive employee or colleague compared to younger applicants?",True

@Sams3dsReviews,2020-08-03T20:17:09Z,1,"Hi Ken, I've been watching your content for a while now, and I love what you put out. Thank you for the videos. I do have a small request. Could you perhaps remove the background music in your videos? Sometimes the music comes off as irritating and given that the main content of your videos is the dialogue, I feel like it's unnecessary to have the background music for the type of videos you make. Keep putting out the great content! I'm learning a lot from you :)",True

@jaigaurav5638,2020-08-03T16:26:34Z,1,"Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline.  Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon.  PS: If you can please tell what name you decided on for your new PC  Once again thank you for making these videos, I cannot stress enough how helpful they are!",True
