@elbaymammadyarov8120,2022-02-22T21:37:23Z,1,"Thanks for  the great video again Ken! I got my pre-acceptance from Warsaw University in the field of Data Science and Business analytics(Master degree) My major at university is Accounting and Audit for know, but at the same time tried to learn some basics of data science and Python programming language. I just wanna ask you  that, If let's say I accepted the offer from WArsaw university and went there, would it be difficult for me to keep up with the other guys? I mean, probably most of them already would know Python or R , computer science and etc, but I am kinda new at this field.",True

@tackydidie,2021-05-09T23:53:53Z,1,"Hey there. I really hope someone sees this. I just recently dropped out of accounting, i have a 4.0 GPA, so it's not because I didn't perform, I just didn't love it...Now, I'm considering a Masters degree in BI, and I have to admit...For someone who's never ever switched tracks, I'm freaking out...I don't really like excel, I'm scared of coding (I've never done it) and the last time I touched statistics was an introductory class in my first year in Uni...I want to be in marketing later on, but the master's degree in marketing isn't valuable (bad placement rate, and low start salary). BI seems to be something that might give me an edge in marketing, and in an of itself, it's valued on the market and pays well of the bat. I'm really struggling right now, because I'm starting to think I should've stayed in accounting, since at least it was clear what the progression of the career would be...Someone please help me! I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown,",True

@mikekelly6774,2021-03-13T01:05:41Z,2,"I hear ya on languages. In the Intro to Data Science course I used to teach, we positioned the class as ""language agnostic"" so I ended up doing every demo in Excel, R, and Python. It made my head spin and I was constantly crossing up the syntaxes. Working only in Python for the past year has made all the difference.",True
@livelierfellow,2021-03-12T23:44:20Z,1,"Hey Ken, I just started an online data science degree this past Jan.  I was wondering a couple things:  Why exactly was the design principles course so helpful?  This is also in my curriculum.  Is it uncommon to continue taking classes WHILE working internships?  I work full time and am nervous about leaving my job to find internships without the promise of a job afterwards.  Was thinking I might start searching for internships once I only have a few classes left so that I might finish the degree during the internship.",True
@jameshizon4861,2021-03-12T23:04:05Z,3,"Focusing on one language at a time. I feel. I had to go back and forth between Python and R because of internship and coursework which made it take longer to build on understanding. In addition, one thing that isn't really talked about is mental health in data. I feel that mental health and burnout have been two ways that led to my own personal career setback. These would be great topics that I believe could add significant value.  Thanks again for being transparent!",True

More specifically, how would you ""learn Python""? With so many ways it can be applied, it's like saying ""learn to use a computer"".",True
@jw_023,2021-03-12T17:54:25Z,2,"My biggest obstacle is that companies have a hard on for prior experience.

@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2021-03-12T15:33:16Z,1,"I believe we usually tend to choose an optimal strategy based on our present situation, whose benefits are only seen on the long term. For example in Morocco, I have to get a Master's Degree, but online courses, assignments and exams take all my time and energy .. Yet I can't just decide to study DS at home and not pursue a Master's Degree because I won't qualify for most job offers. At the same time, pursuing Economic Analysis and Modelling is what introduced me to DS .. Although studying free a home would have saved me so much time, money and effort, I'm not sure I'd follow that path if I wasn't already formally stuyding .. I also believe that you wouldn't bother us today on YouTube if you were socially active in University or studied just one Degree :3 so as you said, I'm Glad things turned out the way there are now",True
