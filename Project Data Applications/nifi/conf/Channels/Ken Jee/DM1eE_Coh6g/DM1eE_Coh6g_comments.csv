@x7331x,2021-10-25T10:39:02Z,1,"Great advice, thanks for that video. Does, based on your experience, CV formatting plays a role? I saw a couple of CVs for people who work some years now as Data Scientists/Engineers and their CVs had almost identical formats, i.e., visual-based CVs. Are those better for passing the Application Tracking Systems?",True

@AntonioIvanovski,2020-12-01T13:34:47Z,4,"Great tips Ken. I always tell my friends, if you have any interesting hobby, don't be afraid to put it in your resume. If you are a black belt in karate, it better be on there! It enables you to stand out and fix mistake #6 on your list and ""have personality in your resume"". I also created a video where I walk students step by step to create their resume, feel free to check it out on my channel.",True

@stanleyolisaemekaafonta1360,2020-11-16T22:57:33Z,1,"Hi Ken, I was hoping to get your advice on something. Well I'm currently getting my Masters in Engineering Management with a Specilization in Analytics. I beleive that was the best path for me to take since I want to start out as a Data Scientist and eventually scale over to Product Management. This program basically teaches me both skills. However, I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors. Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am. I still believe once I am done with the program, I'll have the same skillset as the other majors, I just don't want to get screened out of getting a chance to be interviewed.",True

@adamblomfield7914,2020-09-18T18:21:36Z,2,"Thanks Ken.  I really like the idea of tip 3, on focusing on the outcome not the algorithms.  I'm guilty of spending all my energy on trying to show off a complex algorithm rather than why I'm doing the project in the first place....i.e. what will it help answer/solve and then how to convey that answer.  I'm going to go back and update a few recent projects.",True
@ibraheemelansari7793,2020-08-26T17:35:50Z,1,"Hi ken, I have only one internship related to Data science, but I also worked in a Newsagent, a hostel, and I taught English as a voluntary project. Do you think I should mention them as well ? Or just compensate my lack of experience with more projects and mention that one internship ? Thank you for your time. I really respect you for answering most if not all of the comments on your videos.",True

@kanishksanger847,2020-06-30T07:30:48Z,2,"Hey Ken, I have become a recent follower of yours. Thanks for all the info you have been giving on DS, trying to keep all of that in mind while working.  I have recently done some basic DS projects on Kaggle and I don't think the end result I have gotten out of them are good enough, so should I upload them on github inspite of the not-so-good results or should I first focus on improving them and then upload it?  Thanks in advance!",True

But still at least a 90% of my projects are pure technical software projects. Is it a good idea to list these in my portfolio. Because if not, I'll be presenting a resume with 5 years of software expeirience with no actual portfolio for that part of my life. Does it do any good. Or bad. Can you give your thoughts.?",True
