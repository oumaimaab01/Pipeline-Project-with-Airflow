@KingLarbear,2021-10-11T08:36:29Z,0,I do not think the 3 point should be move and I think dunks and anything really close should be lowered to 1 point,True
@KingLarbear,2021-10-11T08:36:02Z,0,"I believe there should be a 4 point and 5 point shot, the 5 point would be half court and the 4 would be halfway between the 3 and 5",True
@RamaSivamani,2021-05-01T18:56:26Z,0,26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%. So unless you can get wide open dunks on almost every trip down the court dealing with a potential 40% 4 point shooter is not something this league is ready for.,True

I think. Anyways, it's a great video. üôåüèª #66daysofdata",True
@puureshooter7,2020-11-26T20:45:29Z,0,"Technically speaking, shouldn‚Äôt the 3 point line ideally be around 5-10 feet from the rim due to the rapid organic drop in fg% from 60% to 40% you pointed out at 3:55? And then move the free throw line back to 25 feet, have all shooting fouls yield 2 free throws except and-1s which would still be 1 ft. This makes the ev for 2s, 3s, and non and-1 ft trips equal at roughly 1.2. (Given the average ft% now is about 75% at 15 feet, I‚Äôm assuming it would be about 60% at 25 feet)",True

@tobiasbasedow4104,2020-03-13T15:35:50Z,3,"What about adding a 2.5-point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current 3-point line (2 feet closer?), that would give a boost to the no-man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned-upon mid-range jumper. And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded. It might be worth a try. Haven't read that elsewhere as of yet.",True
@toshb1384,2019-12-05T07:38:20Z,2,"nice to see some truly novel analysis outside of the millions of ""predicting handwritten digits from mnist"" videos",True
@brennanruby7297,2019-10-21T20:17:08Z,1,"I thought for sure I could be the annoying guy that said you forgot about how the 4 pt shot helps the value of a 3 pt shot.  I was wrong!  great video as usual.  Love the way you break this stuff down and cover the shortfalls at the end.  I think there are quite  a few things the NBA should look into before this, most importantly scheduling.",True
