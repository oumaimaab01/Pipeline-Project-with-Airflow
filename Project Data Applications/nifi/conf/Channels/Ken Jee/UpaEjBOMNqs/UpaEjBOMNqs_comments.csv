@donnelly5757,2020-10-07T01:06:57Z,1,"Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea. Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.",True
@danielsilva3383,2020-10-05T14:30:02Z,1,"Hello Ken, thanks for the video. I've been following you since you were 5000 subs, but I had never seen your resume and I didn't know you started on data science because you were a golfer. I am a tennis player and I have been searching a lot about data science and I would like to start applying it on my tennis game. I saw an app called SwingVision that does the statistic by its own, but unfortunately is just for Ios and I just have android. I would like to get a free software or build one. Do you know any? If not, what would I have to learn to build a software like that? Thanks for your help",True

@leanwoodworks,2020-10-03T15:12:31Z,1,Ive worked in Data Science for three years now. When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience. It is quite rewarding I went from 58k starting now at 72K three years I pay 0 dollars and 0 cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get 10 sick days a year and 3 weeks Vacation Time. I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit.  I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior.   These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data  to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at  work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it.  When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.  These people have good money to pay and they know it. PACK YER POOP TIGHT thats Marine speak for SHIT together.,True

@hasnain.ajma1,2020-10-02T17:54:31Z,2,"How Much Math do I need in Data Science? Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning   I. Introduction  If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind:  Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background?  What essential math skills are important in data science?  There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include:      Ggplot2     Matplotlib     Seaborn     Scikit-learn     Caret     TensorFlow     PyTorch     Keras  Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It’s important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools. II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model  Let’s suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:  How big is my dataset?  What are my feature variables and target variable?  What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable?  What features are important?  Should I scale my features?  How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets?  What is principal component analysis (PCA)?  Should I use PCA for removing redundant features?  How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE?  How can I improve the predictive power of the model?  Should I use regularized regression models?  What are the regression coefficients?  What is the intercept?  Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression?  What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance?  Without a sound math background, you wouldn’t be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial.  Let’s now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning. III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning 1. Statistics and Probability  Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.  Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Baye’s Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation 2. Multivariable Calculus  Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.  Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function 3. Linear Algebra  Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.  Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors 4. Optimization Methods  Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.  Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm) IV. Summary and Conclusion  In summary, we’ve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it’s important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm.",True
