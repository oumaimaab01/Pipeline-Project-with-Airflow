@KenJee_ds,2022-06-10T07:31:09Z,13,Special thanks to SAS for having me out at the batting lab! Do you think I have what it takes to start my baseball career up again?,True
@WingfanSports,2022-07-06T17:02:29Z,2,One of your best videos yet!  Data literacy is soo valuable and important.,True
@ShaneHummus,2022-06-19T04:44:27Z,1,What the heck this was so unexpected but awesome!  Felt like I was watching a professional documentary.  I wonder if data science could ever help me learn how to not look like a dork when I dance lol?  Probably not üòÇ,True
@lawalsontomiwa1925,2022-06-15T03:30:10Z,1,"Thanks Ken for another great vid , I began data science after school as a way to break into the tech ecosystem, I am also a huge sports fan and founding out that data science can be used in sport as sport analytics has been a great delight. .. please what advice can you give a beginner in data science that wishes to go on the sports analytics path ???",True
@mattRRgraham1996,2022-06-13T14:32:40Z,1,"Wow, haha, I had no idea that you were in the Cary area so recently! The RTP area is a pretty cool place. I love it here. Outside of getting a cool tour and experience at SAS, I hope you got to do and see some other fun stuff here! Great video as always. I really liked how this one was edited and shot.",True
@antti_heino,2022-06-13T06:51:56Z,1,The Lab looks like a fun project with an important cause. Great video!,True
@bon8131,2022-06-12T17:57:12Z,0,"hey Ken very cool video! Applied machine learning is severely lacking on YouTube and videos like this will hopefully promote that change!   i just posted a video going over a free online analytics tool i made, could you check it out and give me any feedback?",True
@shaddee3544,2022-06-12T17:05:59Z,1,Can machine learning Improve  sports betting analytics,True
@SeattleDataGuy,2022-06-12T06:18:26Z,1,What a swing and training montage!,True
@sushantkhattar2598,2022-06-11T19:34:28Z,1,"Really cool video, interesting to see such a good real world application of Data Science in practice, would love to see more such kind of videos!‚ù£Ô∏èü§©",True
@420lomo,2022-06-11T08:35:44Z,1,Whoa this is a sick video dude! Do more of these if you can.,True
@amadios9874,2022-06-11T06:48:35Z,1,This kind of video is very interesting üòÑ it's a great opportunity to see different data science applications for real-world problems,True
@piyushzope10,2022-06-11T03:24:48Z,2,What an amazing lab... It will take sports to another level üôå,True
@ShmeegleSon,2022-06-11T00:47:52Z,1,very cool!,True
@videowatching9576,2022-06-10T23:45:09Z,1,"Wow very interesting. Would be cool if could get a suggestion for specific kinds of swings someone might want ‚Äî or perhaps if could account for height / weight and length of arms / legs for whatever might help to optimize the swing. Totally guessing those would be relevant factors ‚Äî so whatever else shows up to personalize and add ability to select optimization. For example, power vs battery average etc.   Something such as this for shooting a basketball? Some apps made for this but I imagine could be more done.",True
@josephahearn5121,2022-06-10T20:03:19Z,1,"Loved this video! As a kid I had a former MLB player help me with my swing, just one session, and it improved my swing forever. Great to see that ML can have a role in this sort of development too.",True
@dallashutchinson3783,2022-06-10T19:08:10Z,1,What a great video and what seems like an amazing Lab. Data literacy at that age would've saved me years of soul searching üòÖ,True

@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2022-06-10T17:25:31Z,3,Omg amazing video ! I agree this is a wonderful application of how data can help us better ourselves in any field. Loved the lifting and the meteorite bits Haha .. actually every part of the video ! Thanks for the huge efforts üåª,True
@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-06-10T17:15:26Z,1,Also there's a very small podcast called Beyond Coding. They are exceptional however. I think you will really like their content,True
@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-06-10T17:14:43Z,1,Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning have been very good for training sports oriented analysis. If you're interested I can share a few publications with you,True
@sawyerhunt9293,2022-06-10T16:57:46Z,1,"Awesome video! I‚Äôd love to see them expand into improving pitching and fielding metrics using data and technology. Baseball and data, sounds like my dream job!",True
@AlexTheAnalyst,2022-06-10T16:39:12Z,10,This felt like you were one of those reporters who go to different places and find out what they do - was like a News at 8 Special :D Loved it!,True
@LukeBarousse,2022-06-10T15:49:49Z,2,Ken Jee is gonna be called up to the major leagues after this one! üôåüèº‚öæ,True
@Mayur7Garg,2022-06-10T15:02:07Z,1,"Great video but I dislike the fact that the video never addresses comparative improvement in performance had there been no AI model to help. Like I understand AI helped kids be better, but I wanted to know how much these kids would have improved in absence of AI and just by sheer practice and conventional training. Simply put, this is a great problem to solve but can you quantitatively say that AI was needed?",True
@DataProfessor,2022-06-10T14:45:23Z,4,"Never thought SAS would have an amazing data-driven Batting Lab and it truly is a great way to both improve baseball and become aware of data science. 5:37 Haha, good one, almost thought you were going to pick up the front dumbbell Would be cool if the pitcher could be a 3D hologram :)",True
@datanash8200,2022-06-10T14:21:23Z,2,Machine learning and sports is my dream couple!,True
@dikshyakasaju7541,2022-06-10T14:04:48Z,2,"I too noticed the Python code on the screen in the first bit of the video and then you go asking him the same exact question that I was wondering. Haha! Great video, anyway. üëçüèª",True
@daniel_tobi,2022-06-10T13:46:47Z,1,"Allowing kids to interact with data in this ways, are the best. No pressure casually enjoying the game and still learning.",True
@felixc.programs8209,2022-06-10T13:40:17Z,2,Okay THAT is a seriously awesome real world application of data science. Love it!,True
@richmond_a,2022-06-10T13:24:13Z,1,"Nice and refreshing video, felt like a short informative documentary made really well",True
@fknight,2022-06-10T13:08:00Z,7,"I‚Äôm so jealous. Such a sick video! Did you used to play baseball? Because man, your swing is much better than I thought a golfer could do hahaüòÜ",True
