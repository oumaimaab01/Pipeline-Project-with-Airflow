@larigiba,2020-07-30T19:08:48Z,1,"Having a mentor seems like a very cool idea, just having someone you can connect with and learn from while of course making a great new friend.  I think it can be very difficult to find a mentor, especially if you're starting out or data science is not really as established in your country. I look forward to meeting more awesome people on my way and I am super grateful for everyone I have met so far.  These longer videos are really in-depth and I quite enjoy that!",True

@urshema,2020-07-30T03:56:02Z,1,I am switching into data science after 13 years of experience . I was an IT Quality analyst for 8 years but I am not into IT for the past 5 years. I am planning to join full time Masters in Data Science in UK and switch my career. Will this be a good idea? Some universities focus on statistics and deep learning more and some are focusing on computer courses. Which one will be better to choose?,True
