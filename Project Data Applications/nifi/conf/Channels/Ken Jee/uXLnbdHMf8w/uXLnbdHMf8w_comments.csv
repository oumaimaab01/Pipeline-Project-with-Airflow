I started learning just around a month ago (Im lost .....🤪)  for me as an electrical engineer (Industrial: oil & gas), data science like different planet. my mathematical background is very strong, but coding experience is absolute zero.  I found myself really taken by data science. For now, i focus only on Python, (we will see the rest after that) check out freecodecamp.org, they have a very great program with free certificate. their YouTube videos made by university doctors  Great Job Hero🏆  Believe me, Im cheering for you man, like you made a triple points with a big dunk🏀.

And, of course, help each other out, share notes and, even better, work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days? :) PS: a discord chat with voice might also be useful, and I am willing to help establish it, just in case :)",True
@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2020-08-29T07:52:00Z,0,"I am already in the process of taking not just the habits of doing ML every day (that's a requirement I think when you're beginning and new in the field) but als, recently, I started using my Bullet Journal to record my investment and progress into the field.  And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map, seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing, thank you !!  :) Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle ""maelstrom"" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map. As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :) And I assume when we, your followers and students, start becoming proficient and say 'Ken Jee was instrumental in this' ... well ...
