@rubengonzalez-cq2mf,2021-03-27T01:00:38Z,1,Could I be successful majoring in Data Science and minoring in Computer Science? I recently just switched my major and minor choice because of personally preference.,True
@rvj23,2021-02-15T13:00:06Z,1,I'm a second-year Economics student. Do you think I can make the switch? I'm unclear on how to pursue data science from here.,True
@noahj.254,2021-01-24T01:58:26Z,1,Awesome content üëè,True
@leonlamperouge9307,2021-01-10T17:55:25Z,1,"Hey, I came across your channel and I have a question.  I'm currently a junior in high school and I've been intrigued by data science for a while and want to study it in college.  As a result, I've been taking courses like AP  Computer science A ( in java),  AP Stats, and AP calc AB. But what do you suggest I should do or best prepare for an undergraduate degree in data science?    Thank you.",True
@Tim2Diep,2020-08-31T17:48:47Z,1,I am currently an Electrical Engineer and I always felt that my strongest side was in programming and mathematics. I always struggled with the hardware side of EE and was looking to change into another major. What are your opinions on a switch to DS? I have taken Statistics before and enjoyed the class as a tid bit.,True
@colorways518,2020-07-11T16:27:51Z,2,Hey Ken I am currently pursuing my ms in DS but want to continue my studies further will phd be a wise option if I want to work in industry and not planning to go into academia?  Or will MBA be a good option since DS needs some buisness knowledge?,True
@statisticianwordnpl4071,2020-07-10T12:56:27Z,2,"i posted this comment below an other video in data science. i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips. I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw.  A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams  (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc. I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually ""suck"" in it field,like programming ecc.  but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills. So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa. i would like to have your opinion about this tips. thanks. regard from italy :)",True
@mandarvaidya7947,2020-07-09T21:14:02Z,1,I am interested in field of x-informatics  or data driven science or computational science(which has a major chunk of data science).How would you recommend me to proceed?,True
@ryanjohnsen6088,2020-07-09T19:44:08Z,1,My university now offers a dual-degree in computer science and data science that has all of the computer science major courses and some statistics and data science courses. I'm not sure whether or not I should major in CS and continue into an MS in CS and take grad courses related to data science or if I should get the dual-degree in CS and DS. Is the bar for entry in the U.S. for data science/machine learning a graduate degree or could I have job prospects with an undergrad?,True
@muhammadhashir7949,2020-07-09T08:25:42Z,1,"Sir, I want to ask you how many years will data science rule in the number 1 demand for IT profession job",True
@muhammadhashir7949,2020-07-09T08:11:00Z,1,"Ken sir, I want you to add as many projects and courses in your videos as you can",True
@shouryagupta7624,2020-07-09T07:50:03Z,2,Hey ken what would u say about self taught data scientists? Can they never become good data scientist like others? Are data scientist roles in companies can only be play by degree holders? What will employers think about that data scientist?,True
@muhammadhashir7949,2020-07-09T07:38:23Z,2,Ken sir i want you to mention courses as much as you can in your videos because that will be alot helpful to us and thank you for this amazing video i really learned alot from this video,True
@valerysalov8208,2020-07-09T06:04:50Z,1,"I see a crazy hype for Data Science roles/jobs in India, is it the same abroad like in US,EU,Australia,Zealand and Canada?",True
@piercescott8634,2020-07-09T04:19:03Z,3,This video could not have been timed better. I am literally meeting with my counselor next Monday to discuss switching from CS to a undergraduate DS class. Thank you!!,True
@linanguyen7735,2020-07-09T02:30:20Z,2,What is the difference between taking an online MS data science program vs. an on-campus MS data science program?,True

@Cam-dz2in,2020-07-09T00:39:44Z,3,"I am dual major is CS (specialising in DS), and commerce (specialising in econometrics). I am wondering if econometrics would cover enough stats for the DS field? Love the video!",True

@0x007A,2020-07-09T00:04:24Z,6,"If someone chooses an undergraduate degree in data science, in my opinion, they should take first and second year courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science as electives if their data science degree lacks courses in those subjects. I am currently enrolled in an undergraduate data science degree after taking over 60 credit hours in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This advice by Jaemin is spot on and your own videos are very useful.",True
@roseisreading,2020-07-08T20:55:45Z,3,"Right before the pandemic I switched over to Data Science from Agriculture. I am currently studying Computational & Data Science B.S. with a Minor in SE.   Then I will go for a Software Engineering M.S. The undergrad degree is more modeling based... they teach R & Fortran. I am learning Python on my own, this fall I will be starting a 2-part Python certificate, 1 part intermediate 2 part advanced. I hope this is the right track? I want to learn SQL additionally.",True
@prajwal2477,2020-07-08T20:24:32Z,1,I am an undergraduate in Computer Science & Engineering. Could you have a look at these Master's Programme and suggest me which is more relevant to the current industry requirements? Note : I have offers for all 3 programmes mentioned 1 .

@richardy7888,2020-07-08T04:12:20Z,4,I‚Äôm currently doing a masters in ds with a heavy stats component. I transferred from the same course at a different institution that had one stats unit. Do you think this is a good move for my career?,True
@hamzamuhammadkhan,2020-07-08T03:21:58Z,2,"Tough call but I'd say CS or SE not particularly data science it's better to choose after you know most of the stuff that a computer student would know which you will learn in BS CS or SE, then  go for a specialized field",True
@hypercortical7772,2020-07-07T23:25:47Z,2,"It would also be nice to here what y'all think about a Masters program in Data Science vs something more traditional like CS or Stats. (especially curious about degrees labelled ""Masters in Professional Studies"". like are employers put off by that vs an MS?)",True
@jackpiccione6499,2020-07-07T23:02:01Z,3,Hey Ken would you recommend DePaul's MS in DS or MS in CS? I know you did CS just wondering your thoughts.,True
@ImportData1,2020-07-07T18:56:58Z,9,"Thank you for an opportunity to speak to your viewers, Ken! Hope this can help many students who want to pursue their careers in data science!",True
