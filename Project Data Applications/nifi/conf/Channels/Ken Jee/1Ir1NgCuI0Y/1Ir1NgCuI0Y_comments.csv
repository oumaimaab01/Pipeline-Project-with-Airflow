@sagnikmukherjee5429,2021-01-21T19:12:20Z,2,LoL i have watching all these videos and all resumes are Indian only lmao! We are flooding every channel with these i guess,True
@quasenerd5476,2020-11-09T13:32:58Z,1,"Hey, Ken! In another video you adviced against putting your picture on your resume. One of the reasons is that it may hinder the efficiency of screening apps.  You advice against putting icons on the resume too? for example, the icons in https://d.novoresume.com/images/blogs/55839c90-6d75-11e8-9ca8-6d365b13efdc/it-resume.png",True
@mongoslade2789,2020-10-28T21:40:46Z,1,"Hi Ken, I'm newly transitioning into the data science field and am wondering how to approach building a data science resume if none of my work experience is in data science or tech. I've listed several projects, skills, and certifications, but should I also put work experience even if it's unrelated? how would you recommend a  beginner resume like this be structured?",True
@Takk6,2020-10-21T01:53:41Z,2,How can we submit a resume for review?,True
@larigiba,2020-10-15T18:13:00Z,1,"Haha it was really interesting to take a look at Tina's resume :D With this series, one always finds optimization potential in one's resume!",True
@pjs1221618,2020-10-14T06:09:27Z,2,"Hey Ken! Thanks for another great video. I have a question about projects on resumes. I am struggling to think of ways to quantify the purpose of projects beyond just the results of different machine learning models. Because the results are not really put to use after finding them, there is no real quantitative impact to put on the resume (such as a 10% increase in sales).  Is it necessary or suggested to have this for your projects? If so, what ways might you go about restructuring/expanding upon data science projects to address their possible ""lack of usability"" ?",True
@AnkitKumar-ss7sx,2020-10-14T03:00:53Z,2,"Please can you make video on this ""How to choose algorithm for machine learning"".",True
@sherlocksilver9392,2020-10-13T18:56:39Z,1,Hey Ken! Another video idea for the pile: a video on the maths you need to do data science and the best places to learn it. I've been slowing working my way through the Mathematics for Machine Learning textbook and it's hard work for someone who never did maths outside of high school.,True
@TinaHuang1,2020-10-13T18:42:39Z,2,These keep getting more fun! ‚ù§Ô∏è Im also so glad that people are finding them helpful üòÑ,True
@danielsilva3383,2020-10-13T17:07:48Z,1,"Hello, I don't know if you remember the other day when I asked about the automated tennis video analysis. I have been doing some research and I found some research papers and even a thesis with that system I am trying to do. Is it illegal to apply it using OpenCV or some library? Can I use a bit or do I have to do everything from scratch?",True
@ahmedsyed1100,2020-10-13T06:54:35Z,2,"Hey Ken, I have an option of staying at a medium size school and continuing as a business major, or going to UT Austin and doing Liberal Arts. Which do you think is better for a Data Science career?",True
@MM-vx8go,2020-10-12T23:56:50Z,2,Learnt a lot ü§£üòÉ wow,True
@laurianoe7182,2020-10-12T20:21:03Z,1,"Hey Ken, I‚Äôm really enjoying this series, I just have a quick question. If I was crunched on space in fitting all the projects I‚Äôve done, would you say it‚Äôs better to keep your most recent projects on your resume OR would you rather advise to keep the projects that are relevant to the position/company you are applying to although it‚Äôs been 2-3 years since you‚Äôve worked on that specific project?",True
@xavierlim1062,2020-10-12T20:08:36Z,1,Thanks for another great resume review! It gave me a lot of ideas of how I can improve my own resume.,True
@Rahul-gn7px,2020-10-12T19:57:13Z,1,"hey ken , should we describe the personal projects we did in the resume or just mentioning them with an understandable name is enough? thanks",True
@WhisperingAZ,2020-10-12T18:24:23Z,1,great helpful  video  can I also send you my resume  for review  on the next video ?,True
@christopherjones2189,2020-10-12T18:19:04Z,1,"Ken, I'm a huge fan of your channel! I think you're providing an incredible service to aspiring data scientists. The insight you provide is so valuable, even in careers beyond data science. I'm doing my PhD in Chemistry but I've really taken an interest in data science over the past few months. Right now I've been applying machine learning to help develop low-cost COVID diagnostic platforms in our laboratory. I still have a lot to learn but who knows, maybe one day you'll be reviewing my resume!",True
@surajviswakarma254,2020-10-12T18:02:39Z,1,"Now every algorithms works in order to show what we want to watch say YouTube, Google Ads etc.. So sir my question is doesn't it makes us less interested in exploring new things. What if algorithms only shows content based on our past results and never lets us know new things. Suppose i don't have any idea what is deep learning and even didn't hear it before. So how it is likely that one will get to know about it, just by recommendation system or any other search result.   Sorry it might sounds weird üò¨",True
@TheElementFive,2020-10-12T17:00:06Z,1,"Hey Ken, random question. Do you know if Python 3.9 is supported on Anaconda yet? I can't seem to get my environment variable working :(",True
