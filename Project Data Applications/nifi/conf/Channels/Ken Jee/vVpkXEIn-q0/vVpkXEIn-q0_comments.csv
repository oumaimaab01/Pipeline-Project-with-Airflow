Is there any way (in another comment, email, etc.) in which I could get your quick opinion on what courses should I focus on taking so I can make my experience as valuable as possible ?",True
@anubhavgoyal3211,2022-03-08T06:45:55Z,2,Sorry Ken! Haven't been able to stay active in the comment section lately because of the exams,True

@zuxzux,2022-03-03T18:31:27Z,1,"NFTs are pretty risky so some data analysis is certainly useful for anyone who wants to get into them. Frankly, after getting in on NFTs early, I'm totally out now. One other example of risk is how little regulation there is upfront. I flipped an NFT that a few days later was determined to be copywritten material and the entire project was deleted from OpenSea entirely. Anyone who still had one in their wallet got stuck holding the bag on that one.  Would be interesting to do some analysis that allowed you to spot trends and get in on NFT projects before they really blew up. Still feels like gambling though lol.",True
