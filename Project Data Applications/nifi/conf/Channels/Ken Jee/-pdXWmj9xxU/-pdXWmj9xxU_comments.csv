@bin4ry_d3struct0r,2022-11-27T03:25:52Z,1,Great process! I should look into this Notion app.,True
@farhanislam8463,2021-10-19T13:34:49Z,2,"Thank you. As a beginner , it is okay to just copy other people's notebooks . I didn't know that, and it used to make me miserable . I can make small projects of my own now(really small) , but it still helps to know that back then,  I didn't know, what I didn't know.",True
@piyushthakur2386,2021-04-07T14:22:17Z,1,"I was doing it all wrong till now. When in earlier video you said go through the notebooks, I was literally reading the code not understanding. Thanks for clearly explaining what we are looking for when we look at the code and how to use the documentations the better way. Thank you so much .",True
@rajnigoyal6653,2021-02-13T00:09:42Z,1,"Interestingly, i left beginners project many times just because I could not approach and do them myself. And seeing other's notebook looks like cheating to me. Thank you for removing my notion.",True
@piyushzope10,2021-02-05T18:56:56Z,4,Thanks for explaining the process. Reviewing is the best way which we can apply for learning and I also use discussion like if you have someone with you while studying it leads to good results. I am interacting with you through video but it is really great because it motivates me to come back again and go ahead.,True
@deepasarojam4425,2021-01-15T01:29:09Z,1,"I've always had this question on how to approach a solved notebook? Should I code open the notebooks side by side and type in one by one or should I go over the solved one and then try to understand. I always wondered how others might be doing or which is the best approach (if any)! So, how would have approached if that was a video lecture where the solution walkthrough is done? Any suggestions, Ken? And, thanks a ton for creating such nuggets of videos, really helpful for beginners like me. Even the comments sections in your videos are insightful.",True

@0x007A,2021-01-01T11:43:07Z,1,"Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a ""sanitized"" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing ""notebooks"" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?   Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary?    The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.  Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.",True
@nguyenthehoang9148,2020-12-03T00:52:16Z,1,"Hi Ken Great content as usual May I have some recommendations or suggestions from you? I'm in my graduate study on modeling fish population dynamics. The situation is that I know about one field, working with data and models in this particular area but I wanna make myself a bit more employable post graduation. Therefore, I start looking up about data science, and realize there are some part of data science work I already do (I just don't know it's called data science out there lol). However, there are some part I haven't touched yet (e.g. computer vision, random forest, and neural network).  Should I do machine learning and deep learning courses to organize my knowledge?  I deeply understand that nobody can cover all the topics. It's just not happening. What I expect is to be well-prepared for job.  Thank you",True
@rahuldas6777,2020-10-22T00:26:40Z,1,"So I did a project on linear regression and I'm still kind of struggling to understand it.

@sukantasaha5678,2020-10-05T17:44:17Z,5,"This is actually so much like machine learning algorithms themselves. Like we go through loads of notebooks to understand the innate algorithms and patterns of being s good data scientist and then after we're done training ourselves with others notebooks, we can test our understanding by predicting on newer projects and then matching with others who have done the similar projects. 🙄",True

@kevinnolasco341,2020-09-06T00:33:54Z,2,"This video was great!  I have found some frustration from ""not understanding a topic"" but not looking for a different explanation. For example, I struggled to understand what a p-value is and how it is useful; to understand what the p-value was, I found a statistics textbook and read about it. I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up!  Thanks for the video Ken!",True

If I end with new function or new term I basically Google it out or search in stack.

@xordux7,2020-09-04T17:39:45Z,2,"I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook:  1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models. 2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion.  There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section.  I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%. It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks.",True

@DataProfessor,2020-09-04T16:09:29Z,9,"Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc.  On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts 😃), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips!
