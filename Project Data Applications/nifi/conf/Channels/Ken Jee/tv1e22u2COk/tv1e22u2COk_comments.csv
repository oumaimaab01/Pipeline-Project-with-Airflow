@BiancaAguglia,2019-09-04T02:10:44Z,0,"I like Kaggle for its competitions and for its kernels which, as you said, are one of the best ways of learning practical data science lessons.  Also, I love YouTube, even though I do most of my learning from reading not from watching videos. The reason YouTube feels special is that some YouTubers are great at storytelling. They help me have a more personal connection to what I'm learning. ðŸ˜Š",True
