One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way: After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages) This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = ""/images/..""  To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing.  Change the ""/images/.."" to  ""https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/.."" and the images will show This was something I faced and that's how I fixed it.
