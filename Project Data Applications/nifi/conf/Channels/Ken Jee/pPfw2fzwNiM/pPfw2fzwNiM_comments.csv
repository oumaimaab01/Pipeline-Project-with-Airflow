@AJ-ly8si,2023-03-05T21:26:38Z,0,Can you update the data and make one for 2023 once the bracket is released?,True
@itscrewston6684,2022-08-07T03:43:48Z,1,A data science/analytics channel that works with basketball data?! Hell yeah,True
@Raiseren,2022-05-04T09:18:56Z,1,Did you backtest anything? Why did you opt for a simulation model when predicting game winner without having in-play data? It honestly looks very random what you did with little thoughts to your strategy. This is something I would expect from a very junior data scientist. Not someone having a youtube channel intended to teach data science.,True
@mnm8818,2021-10-12T04:34:52Z,1,my rant: I think more important ones are matchups - eg one team can win all games all the time vs another team but loose every game to other teams + home court advantage - think betting odds already do this already? and they have a big team of coders/ prob analyst I'm guessing.,True

@jamesscouten2966,2021-03-19T15:38:32Z,2,"Quick story......I live in Vegas. I love sports.   Obviously, it was only a matter of time before I started thinking I could ""beat the book.""  Using my brain and spreadsheets wasn't cutting the mustard, so I started researching how people used computers to figure out more efficient ways of being a winning player.  That's when I discovered data science. I then saw how much more to the field there was than just figuring out how to beat Vegas. I was hooked.   And that is how my data science journey  began.",True
