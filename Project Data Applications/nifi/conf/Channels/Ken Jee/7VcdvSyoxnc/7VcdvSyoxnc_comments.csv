@donnelly5757,2020-09-23T15:46:47Z,3,"I applied in hopes that I could get mentorship when it comes to looking for an entry-level data analyst job. All I got was it said I am a bit too early and should brush up on my fundamentals. My goal is to someday be a data scientist, but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role, and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry-level data analyst job. I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree, so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own. I have been using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for nearly a year now.  I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub. I have over a year with using SQL. I am now taking a Coursera course on Tableau and working on an Oracle Database Administrator certification course. How much longer will it take for me to land an entry-level data analyst job? I am doing what I can to not have to take out more student debt for a CS degree.",True
@piyushtalele3594,2020-09-23T15:22:14Z,1,"Hello Jeremie Harris,  Sorry but SharpestMinds is not operating in India. We have a lot of MOOC's available and it becomes confusing in which one to take. To be practical or theory.  Especially I get confused like when I take up theory I tend to take theory as I do not understand the things used and why and when doing theory I tend that I am lacking the practical. I end up really end doing absolute nothing. I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India. Please may it available for enthusiast like us .Please can you make it available in India.  Thanks   Piyush Talele",True
@ChaiTimeDataScience,2020-09-23T15:15:05Z,5,"SharpestMinds, the team and company, are both truly amazing and really the best mentorship programs in this space. Only request to them would be to expand to India soon ðŸ™‚",True
