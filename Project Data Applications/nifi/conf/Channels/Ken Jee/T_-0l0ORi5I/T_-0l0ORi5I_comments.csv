@6Mar99,2023-09-19T05:57:34Z,5,"I feel this a lot as I am currently transitioning from my customer service role (for the past 7 years) into data analytics. I've been job hunting since June and no luck so far. 92 job applications sent, 6 initial interviews, 1 interview with a hiring manager but no job offer so far. I've done projects  and tailor fitted my resume and cover letter to be relevant to the fields that i am applying to and did pro bono work to have a relevant work experience for my resume, and still nothing. While doing my projects, I've come to love analytics more and more despite the rejections so I am 100% certain about my career shift. However, burnout from the job rejections is slowly creeping in. To add insult to injury, I've seen entry/junior level positions that's asking for 5 years of experience in the field. I just hope to see something positive in my career in this field  Informative video as always Ken! You have been instrumental in my career shift and journey into data science and analytics. Papaya!",True
@nomorepartiezz,2023-09-12T11:00:40Z,6,"wow if that graph about the job market is true then that explains a lot about my situation. I graduated college in May so around March-May is when I started getting really desperate for a job and it felt completely hopeless. couldn‚Äôt even get anything but automated rejection emails. Spent the summer doing the ‚Äúupskill‚Äù portion of this video, waited tables while living with my parents and working on a portfolio and certifications. around August I started noticing more attention from recruiters, and I finally got a really good job offer in September! Hopefully things work out for me",True

@RobnGG,2023-09-09T23:39:43Z,1,Lowkey kind of a depressing video,True
@Sarwaan001,2023-09-09T20:43:20Z,2,Also wanted to add that data engineer is more similar to backend software developing rather than scientific/gaining insights.,True
@Sarwaan001,2023-09-09T20:40:31Z,4,I actually have the stats for my entry level hit rate: 10 interviews/461 applications = 2%  Senior level hit rate: 23 interviews/36 applications = 52%   It gets easier (or maybe I was just lucky the second time around),True
@necophilip,2023-09-08T18:52:21Z,0,Goddamit I've been sticking this career path since graduation but hit a brick wall twice after 1.contract ended in Dec 2020 and 2. a major lay off Summer 2023. I guess it's my Waterloo in 2020 but come on it can't be twice?!,True
@RoopmathiGunnaubcmba,2023-09-08T16:05:33Z,4,Thanks Ken this was a very honest update of the DS market,True
@garp9433,2023-09-07T13:26:27Z,2,You can have multiple contracts if you have your own company. That means way more money.,True
@IanRahwan,2023-09-06T23:20:59Z,3,Ken you are an honestly valuable content creator.,True
@StevenNguyen779,2023-09-06T20:58:32Z,2,"For data science projects, how much would you recommend creating to make one stand out the most? And what project topics do you recommend? I have no idea which topic I wanna choose rn. From your experience, how long did it take for you to create a beginner data project?",True
@wolfgangschroder6742,2023-09-06T20:00:37Z,1,"Very informative and factual as always. Thanks. I have a question, hope I could get some advice from you. I really like the processing, model building, date modeling and mathematical and coding side of data science but hate the reporting and communication side, which is also my weakness point. Which specialized role should I apply for and pursue?",True
@LukeBarousse,2023-09-06T15:33:11Z,11,"""Treat the job search like a data science problem"" ü§Ø  Also, I second this recommendation on social media (or just building things)... I'm now fortunate enough that I don't have to apply to jobs and companies typically reach out me.",True
@StebanCow,2023-09-06T14:53:59Z,6,Is there a big difference between logistics and data-related jobs (besides the job title)? I find right now there are huge opportunities in the logistics or supply chain field which all lack good data management and analytics practices. It was the only way I was able to get my foot in the door in the competitive market and use that opportunity to learn and develop.,True
@brianferrell9454,2023-09-06T12:07:03Z,1,There is also quantitative analysts! Don't forget those,True

@bin4ry_d3struct0r,2023-09-05T23:31:31Z,2,"This video is indeed very helpful. I concluded many of the points made here on my own over time.  I also very much look forward to the video on contracting. There are entire courses dedicated to teaching data scientists/ML engineers on how to be freelancers. Although I'm happily employed where I am, I want to at least explore the option of being my own boss someday.",True
@David-cx3fc,2023-09-05T19:52:59Z,5,One of your most helpful videos so far! Straight to the point and real/honest advice. Lost my job two weeks ago. Was not in tech. Graduated with a math degree two years ago. I‚Äôve self studied data science related projects on the side but never did enough studying to get the role in tech. This helps motivate me to just get it done and study hard for the next few weeks. Made a better resume and staying on top of applications. Thanks for everything you put into your channel Ken! Really lifted me up today,True
@nikjojo,2023-09-05T19:28:06Z,1,"- getting Azure cents helped my callback  - gonna upskill / specialize into data engineering self learning  - LinkedIn has next to 0 callbacks for me, but Indeed works extremely well",True
@krishnasarawagi1315,2023-09-05T18:54:42Z,2,Thank You So Much for the advice.s It was really really needed.,True
@illumi3604,2023-09-05T16:42:43Z,4,I'm embarrassed to admit it but I never gave much thought of observing the statistics of job hunting or the specialization of data science jobs. Thanks for the eye opener.,True
@patfov,2023-09-05T15:58:50Z,3,"Hi Ken! Thanks for this video. It's very helpful. I''d like to watch the contracting videos. I'm starting in data science with previous experience in business analysis, and I'd like to build something and be a contractor.",True
@Joan.Zacarias,2023-09-05T13:11:30Z,1,"Hello Ken, great video. I would like to ask you some questions: Do you think it's possible to create an extra layer of automation to outperform the job market? I don't have a university degree, and I'm not aware of how much of a disadvantage that puts me at. Should I consider bootcamps? Furthermore, I'm thinking of starting a DS YT channel, beginning with explaining the basics. Any suggestions before I start? Thank you very much for your content.",True
@rodrigodasilva9176,2023-09-05T12:58:51Z,3,"Ken Jee, awesome video! Please, make that video about independent contracts over full time jobs at big companies. Also, talk about freelancer possibilities. Thank you very much!",True
@neurosync_research,2023-09-05T12:27:35Z,1,"I follow the strategy of networking more and applying to smaller set of positions. I much prefer informal networking to formal networking, I wish there was more of it.",True
