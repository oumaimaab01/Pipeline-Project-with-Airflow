@fratzlol,2020-12-16T11:39:44Z,1,"Hey Ken,  Thank you so much for all the work you put in your videos.  Back in May, I started my data science journey after 5 years in project management and I was kind of lost on what path to choose. Following your advice, I started online courses, then worked on Kaggle projects, and finally built a portfolio.   Now, 7 months later, I landed my first internship as a data scientist ! What tipped the scales in my favor was the portfolio, which I made thanks to the Hugo tutorial on your channel !  So here, thanks from a grateful subscriber =)",True

However, on that gap, I lost the knowledge I had :)) and added more to my depression and imposter syndrome. Now walking through your youtube videos (you have done quite great stuff when I was not out there ) makes me feel safe that I'm actually not that late and I can start it over, I believe that community is going to have a great impact on me!

@mattRRgraham1996,2020-11-16T15:55:10Z,2,"Hi Ken, nice video! I didn't participate in this one but I'll join the discord server and do the next one! Quick question: what video editing software do you use? I see in your description your computer details and the camera you use, and I searched throughout your channel to make sure you didn't have a video talking about this stuff, so I'm sorry if you get asked this a lot, I just am going to be done with my second-to-last semester of grad school this week (!!!) and have like, 2 months for christmas break so I was going to spend some time learning editing stuff so I can hopefully start my own youtube channel soon enough. I can't afford the camera yet, but I don't need that to start. I've got some ideas and I just am curious to know what software you use to edit your videos. Do you have a preamp and a mic with a pop filter you use? Thanks!",True

@mohammedazeem3303,2020-11-16T03:38:02Z,1,"@Ken Jee this was an absolute journey so far. I think we can have the version2.0 to be more inclined towards practical implementation. We can form teams on Discors & work towards common goal, improving upon the basic we have learnt so far.  1. We all can curate a list of projects from multiple domain & decide which one to work & with whom. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.",True

@joshcummins3916,2020-11-13T18:08:51Z,3,"Hey Ken, When I started the 66 days of data challenge my goal was to learn deep learning. I was going to learn it through some paid resources but little did I know that posting everyday would open doors to have recruiters talk with me. I got to speak with recruiters from Amazon, Facebook, and a consultancy group. I have now pivoted to Computer Vision as the niche I want to focus on. I look forward to doing this again in January.",True
@0megal2,2020-11-13T18:01:55Z,2,"The 66daysofdata challenge is actually helping me to get though with my degree thesis too. Seeing as I was doing the 5 min even if I was tired from work, I told myself: ""If I can do 5, I can do 10!"" and then set an extra goal of 5 min of daily thesis progress. Some days are harder than others, but it's working and I plan to finish it by February, and that's something a need to thank you for Ken! You really are an inspiration.",True

They referred me to some research papers related to the respected domain which had seriously complicated math (look at it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225708015_Impact_on_inventory_costs_with_consolidation_of_distribution_centers).  I am really overwhelmed with all this and am kind of scared by looking at the same.  What should I do?

@ddranimestyle,2020-11-13T15:46:23Z,2,"I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the ""5 mins a day"" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course. And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative, with all of these improvements in mind!",True

@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2020-11-13T13:20:53Z,7,"Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :)  And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the ""Silent Flute"". The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age,  it's full of wisdoms!   One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, ""seemed to know everything"" he simply answered with this:  ""Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day."" ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added ""... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.""  I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life.   Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one.   Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text.  ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly).   Good luck to everyone for not just your #66daysofdata, not your #666daysofdata but, why not?, your #alifeofdata ;)",True

I delegated the first part to kaggle, Data Camp, etc. and that just isn't long term sustainable or even short term optimal. No regrets though. :)",True
