@shrutijain1628,2021-01-17T15:19:30Z,2,I want to ask one question so this part of series where I get struck because I don't understand it so is it okay that I like follow step by step this video do that ...I mean I still did a project but literally must have copied this thing so I am not sure what's your point view on this?🥺😅,True
@shrutijain1628,2021-01-01T04:03:32Z,3,Heyy can you make a particular video on to choose which model should be used and like what are the most used model in general so in ML we learn that with great importance 💯 Ps: I am taking too long to complete this series 🥴,True
@vinipuonder5455,2020-11-20T18:27:41Z,3,"Again, nice job. It was really helpful. Now I understand how a model code should look like and I also learned some tricks.  There is only one thing I think could have been better. Sometimes I couldn't understand what you were doing nor why. It felt like I was just watching you code. I understand it is hard to explain everything while you are debugging or improving the model, but you could have added some explanations while editing.  Anyway, this doesn't take the value of the video.   Many thanks!!",True
