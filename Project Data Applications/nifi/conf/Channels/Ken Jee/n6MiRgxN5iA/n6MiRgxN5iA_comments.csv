@janehuang8124,2021-11-10T18:20:52Z,1,how to start? where to start a podcast?,True
@LeonLokk,2021-11-09T13:21:46Z,1,It's amazing to hear you say that you also struggled and stumbled over your words early on. I've wanted to start a podcast for months now but I'm fairly introverted so I've been putting it off. Your comment about controlling the environment instead of being controlled by it hit the nail on the head and I've never thought about it that way.  Thanks for sharing that Ken! That's something that I'll remember for a long time.,True
@mathewsjoy8464,2021-11-06T22:28:41Z,2,"Hey I stumbled across your channel and been enjoying the content. I really want to do a intermediate data analytics project (ideally with SQL, Python tableau etc) but struggle for good ideas, I don’t want to just do a basic get csv data set and analysis but want to do bit more in depth and challenging, do you have any ideas? Thank you",True
@DataProfessor,2021-11-06T01:15:16Z,8,"Agreed 100%, I also feel that it helps me to understand myself better as well. Do you think it’s possible for the next guest on Ken’s Nearest Neighbors to be Ken Jee? Ken interviews Ken, would be an awesome episode :)",True
@Rawi888,2021-11-05T21:20:27Z,2,You know.... Thank you for this. I'll give it a shot.,True
@lecryptojames,2021-11-05T15:24:48Z,5,Started a small YouTube channel and it helped me practice communication and storytelling skills to recently land a Data Engineer Consultant role. Definitely agree haha,True
@johndavidariansen,2021-11-05T15:20:03Z,2,What are your thoughts on live podcasting? I'm curious how much editing you're currently doing...,True
@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2021-11-05T14:56:07Z,3,I really like your podcast ! I was wondering how much time does it take doing research on the guest ? Or maybe as time goes by you don't need to prepare as much as before ?,True
@fknight,2021-11-05T14:40:50Z,4,6:26 I made the cut!! I’m also a very animated talker… my hands help tell the story 😂,True
@harshitsati,2021-11-05T13:48:24Z,6,"KNN is really a great channel with great content, I love the style of ""insert situation/problem"" as the video/podcast topic, this makes it a lot better for someone to relate to.",True
@Mara_143,2021-11-05T13:33:30Z,4,🌸🙏🏽🌞,True
@Major_Data,2021-11-05T13:27:07Z,10,"I'm thinking of starting sort of an anti-podcast and titling it something super awkward like, ""Nobody Should Listen to This Podcast."" I'd describe it as an arrogant jerk and his (formerly) inner monologue.   That way, it's half satirical reverse psychology, half self-sabotage. Which is sort of my thing, really. 😁",True
@sebisamuel2605,2021-11-05T13:12:12Z,4,"I started a podcast mainly coz I just wanted to learn how to talk to people. To get out of my social awkwardness. And it worked!! Absolutely agree with all the points you have made and even though I have only done 2-3 episodes I can relate very much!! Am very much looking forward to resume my podcast work after my college applications and all thanks to you Ken!! 🐢🐢🐢  My podcast isn't that interesting, it's completely random hahaha(It did make Tina laugh tho 🤡). Let's see if my brain helps me to make interesting content 🤠🤠🐢🐢",True
