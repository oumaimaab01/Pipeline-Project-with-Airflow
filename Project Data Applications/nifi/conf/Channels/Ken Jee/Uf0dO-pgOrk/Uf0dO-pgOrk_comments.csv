The way I see it, it is that by you sharing your life experiences and other people experiences, when you do the interviews, your are providing me with invaluable information. I think, it is MY responsibility to take the information that you provide as an advice or just as interesting information. I appreciate all the effort that you put into researching the topic and putting it in an understandable manner.  By the way, I got the point of your video, that is embraced it and grow with it.

@byoutekinaeiyuu,2020-10-16T19:53:58Z,4,"""We fail more then we success""  - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;)   I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a ""real scientist"" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all.  One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)...  As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic.  The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things.  I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today.  I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)",True
@TinaHuang1,2020-10-16T19:41:51Z,1,Thank you so much for this video! It resonated so much with me.

@user-qy9ys7ux6v,2020-10-16T18:00:01Z,1,letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people  like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.,True

@patrickcoady3110,2020-10-16T16:31:01Z,3,"I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. ""Shouldn't this be easier?"", ""How does anyone understand this"", or ""The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand"". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot. The other issue is time, the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks. I don't know what to do about that, we are finite creatures after all.",True
