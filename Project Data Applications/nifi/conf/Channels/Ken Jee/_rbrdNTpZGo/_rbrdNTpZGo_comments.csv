@jaigaurav5638,2020-07-24T15:53:18Z,2,"Hello Sir! I'm a student whose currently studying in class 12th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist. Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters' degree, I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this. As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because - 1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool 2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time 3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense  Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!
