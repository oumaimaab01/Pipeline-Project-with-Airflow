@HOORAY4CH33SE,2020-05-22T22:25:59Z,1,hey! I sent you an email requesting to have my resume reviewed. thanks,True
@Data360YP,2020-05-22T12:50:34Z,1,Great video Ken! I like how you focused on the findings and not just the model! It's something that people don't talk about but we need to give it more focus! Keep up the great work!,True
@larigiba,2020-05-21T08:09:05Z,2,"good review! I think this shows once again that documentation is really crucial. In the end it does not matter how many incredible projects someone made, if they can't showcase and explain them clearly, even if this sounds harsh. This really motivates me to improve my own resume, I'm working on it but because I'm from Germany I actually have to translate my homepage so that I can send it out to international recruiters if needed, and that takes up some time as well :D I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much. For smaller companies though there can of course be differences.",True

@duncangates522,2020-05-20T06:24:15Z,1,"Hi Ken, I love your videos, they've been incredibly helpful. I'm an economics major with an actuarial science minor and am teaching myself Python and SQL through DataCamp right now (I already have a fair amount of experience with R). I am also doing a data science internship this summer. I know this may make it seem like I am pretty set but I am also graduating this fall and am pretty scared about my job prospects. Do you have any advice for more I could be doing to try to get into the field?",True
@26_chirayuaggarwal23,2020-05-19T13:45:51Z,2,Great Video !!!!!!! Question :- I watched andrew ng machine learning course on coursera but he taught everything on Octave . I know basic things about machine learning but nothing about phython . Could you recommend me a course just for python for machine learning,True

@lucasteixeira5346,2020-05-18T19:05:08Z,1,"Hello, Ken. Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US, I can speak about Brazil (my home country) and France (the country I currently live). Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player. Watching youtube videos about data science I have the impression that on the US the job interviews focus a lot on asking technical questions, but I'm not sure if it's the same through all types of jobs.",True
