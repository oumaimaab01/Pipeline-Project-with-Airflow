@megaprimegamer1184,2021-06-05T19:49:49Z,1,"Hey Ken. What would the best approach be if I already have a project but am just getting started with Python programming?¬† On conversing with a data scientist one time, I was told it was a deep learning problem. I am confused if I should learn what's necessary for this project or approach it like everyone else?",True

@byoutekinaeiyuu,2020-12-05T22:23:56Z,2,"I like the last project ideas. :) It's nice how you start from scrapping and data analysis and end with AI ;)  What did you do for the glassdoor project (data scraping wise) if you don't mind me asking? If I understand things correctly, if the robots.txt forbids you from scraping them, you use their API and all is cool?   How is it with using youtube data for data science projects? I'm not talking about downloading videos - I'm interested in comments, video titles and thumbnails. Intuitively it should be ok to use those...   Edit: I should watch the videos of the projects you reviewed for inspiration.",True
@BadEnoughDudeRescues,2020-11-14T16:06:30Z,2,"Hi Ken, love your videos. Got a question for web scrapping tho. Maybe I'm missing it, but what should I be looking out for in the robots.txt about scraping? I pulled up the glassdoor one on my own, but not sure which line says to not scrape. Maybe I'm missing it or don't really know what to look for.",True

@mattRRgraham1996,2020-10-09T20:06:01Z,2,Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA. Great content.,True
