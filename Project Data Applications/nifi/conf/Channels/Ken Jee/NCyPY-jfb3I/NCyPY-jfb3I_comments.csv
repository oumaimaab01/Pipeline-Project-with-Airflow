@zero_day_xsploit,2023-08-27T21:17:39Z,0,Does this do LIVE games as well?

@garymichalske2274,2023-02-25T18:13:18Z,0,"Hi Ken,  Thank you so much for this  video!  I was able replicate everything you demonstrated in it.  My goal is to have all the games for several seasons showing the away team on the left with all their stats and then have the home team on the right with all their stats. I was trying to understand the TeamGameLogs endpoint but don't know enough about it to see any of its data.  Can you point me in the right direction or perhaps do a video showing how to do this?  UPDATE:  Well..I got started in figuring it out.  The code below only gave me the 2016-2017 season and only the Team stats, none for the opponent.  Here's the code I used to get the games in the game log.  Not quite structured as described above, but all the games nonetheless.  from nba_api.stats.endpoints import TeamGameLogs all_games = TeamGameLogs() all_games_df = all_games.get_data_frames()[0] all_games_df.to_csv('nba_gamelog.csv')",True
