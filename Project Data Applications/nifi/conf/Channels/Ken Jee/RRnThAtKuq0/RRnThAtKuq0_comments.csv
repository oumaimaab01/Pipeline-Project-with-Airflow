@KenJee_ds,2023-04-04T01:49:07Z,9,Thanks for watching everyone! I promise this is me and not Chat GPT (contrary to what the end of the video may suggest),True
@claudiotorres9138,2023-09-07T18:30:54Z,1,how does it handle angular?,True
@LeonAlkoholik67,2023-04-19T13:19:52Z,1,It isn't that great. It even struggles every now and then with a baby language like AutoHotkey and even struggles to differentiate v1.1 and v2 and sometimes makes things up that aren't true still. It can write prototype code and you adjust it from there. That's pretty much it.,True
@stenbiller99,2023-04-16T15:14:32Z,1,dude that ending...... hahaha,True
@HaseebHeaven,2023-04-07T11:29:32Z,2,I am also using GPT 4 for coding a while i can say its 70% accurate than previous iterations but it also makes mistakes sometimes it forgets methods which are necessary and don‚Äôt know the flow of code.,True
@wwlee5,2023-04-06T08:27:30Z,1,Looks like a lot less need for software engineers then,True
@Charles-dt6dh,2023-04-05T15:53:00Z,0,"Before it was very hard to find the specific solution to my problem but now, I just had to ask chatGPT then validate if the response is right or wrong",True
@AKispert1965,2023-04-05T04:21:29Z,8,"I see ChatGPT 4 for software development as both a learning and productivity tool.  I can easily see a future interview where I have to demonstrate conversational programming utilizing ChatGPT 4 and then explaining the code it has written.  I don't think it will replace programmers, but will result in programmers with more productivity.",True
@jturk0131,2023-04-05T00:51:48Z,0,Not lying about that soon u won't be coding at all üòÇüòÇüòÇ,True
@user-wr4yl7tx3w,2023-04-04T21:59:34Z,1,Same with writing. I hope craft of writing will no longer be deemed the end goal. Like how calculators have replaced silly algorithms for basic maths.,True
@yourlogicalnightmare1014,2023-04-04T19:45:16Z,0,"ShatGPT is only as smart as the data it is trained on, making its use cases very limited.  If you trained it on the collective knowledge of 6 year old children, the software is incapable of giving you a 12 year old's answer.    The more you learn about AI, the more you realize how absurdly stupid the whole approach to AI is.",True
@metinunlu_,2023-04-04T16:10:09Z,1,Ending was a good touch haha,True
@diegoariel707,2023-04-04T12:43:13Z,4,"Been hearing that a lot of the junior positions for Data Analysis are gonna be dead thanks to IA, what do you think?",True
@moisesdiaz9852,2023-04-04T12:38:48Z,6,Clearly Ken just wanted to flex his biceps,True
@lexscarlet,2023-04-04T12:06:14Z,4,"We think a lot faster than anything we do, not just coding. Conversational coding, in your terms, works so well in my humble estimation because once that thing starts spitting out the code to what you want to accomplish, you can get right back to work ideating. When I used to code without chatGPT, my mind would be flooding with ideas and the mechanical distraction of trying to type with minimal errors and get the code down BEFORE I forget the next thing I want to work on that keeps intrusively disrupting. Now, I type my request, it does its thing, and I'm way more likely to keep the train of concepts flowing. Sometimes I'll furiously scribble some indecipherable reminder while it's outputting, so I can return to that line of thought after I double check its work.  This thing is beyond a game changer.",True
@enotdetcelfer,2023-04-04T12:05:46Z,0,"I feel like I got promoted from code monkey to project manager on all my personal projects. If they're really worth anything, we're about to find out because my job is ideation, direction, and integration and chat gpt is my programming team. I'd call it Prompt Coding. The better your prompts, the better the code",True
@user-rc1bh6tn8b,2023-04-04T12:02:00Z,2,"With IA's getting improved, would it be wise to start to learn data science and spend more than 1 year learning about it ?",True
@insanerinze,2023-04-04T07:08:36Z,0,"I think what a lot of people failed to understand, is that AI is a function and humans are the input. Without proper input (or prompts), there's no way AI can function therefore everything you're learning at present is still very valuable and important because your input helps to verify, identify & validate the expertise of the subject. Please don't be that person who takes AI prompts as replacement for everything because it just proves you're not an expert of the field! Why are you somehow speaking on behalf of lawyers as a content writer ?????",True
@marcinjagusz2481,2023-04-04T05:06:52Z,3,"Dear GPT-4, please write the transcript for the video ""I'll Never Code the Same Again... (GPT-4 is OP)"". Thanks, Ken.  üòÑ",True
@bin4ry_d3struct0r,2023-04-04T04:54:39Z,0,"We also need to worry about using ChatGPT to potentially code ourselves out of a job. Tina just released a video about this herself, and she's freaking out.",True

@DP52879,2023-04-04T00:30:40Z,1,What a twist üòÇ,True
@EricLeung-hk,2023-04-04T00:29:30Z,1,Do you think OpenAI would take any responsibility of it's ai product if it leads your apps to something wrong?  Are you the only ONE to face any legal or other consequences. Even Images it provides is based on some existing images. They might have copyrighted.,True
@6Mar99,2023-04-03T22:45:55Z,4,"I would like to know your thoughts on how GPT-4 would affect the data analytics world in terms of employment. I'm almost done with the Google data analytics certificate and its pretty nerve-wracking. Although AI cannot fully replace the job, it might lower, if not, eliminate the demand for junior analysts. I am planning to take AI courses in Coursera though to hedge my skillset in this hyped up AI period. Great video as always!",True
@twigax7993,2023-04-03T20:03:13Z,2,Genuinly scary end üòÇ,True
@hidayatlahabu3345,2023-04-03T19:44:11Z,1,"I agree with ""loosing human touch, but not really loosing creativity, coz AI helped us to type what is in our mind, and that is creativity of human mind, so don't ask how to build something, but ask about some problem when we build something..maybe this is just my thoughts",True
@codingcrashkurse6429,2023-04-03T18:58:17Z,3,"I have talked about GPT-4 vs GPT-3 on my own channel as well. The difference is HUGE! GPT-4 is a different beast, at least for me a programmer. But in comparison to the release of ChatGPT, there is almost no hype around it.",True
@codingcrashkurse6429,2023-04-03T18:55:46Z,2,Would you mind sharing how you did the animation with ChatGPT? Would really appreciate that üôÇ,True
@danielvandervelde7478,2023-04-03T18:39:25Z,2,holy shit the ending ‚ò†‚ò†,True
@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2023-04-03T18:36:33Z,6,"Ahahaha the ending killed me! Nice touch ‚ù§ Your creativity hasn't died with the automation üåª My coding style also changed completely especially for specific usecases!  However, one concern I have is the ability to develop professionally and understand the code you're using. I am currently using Django and I just pasted a normal plotly chart to ChatGPT and asked it to convert it to plotly.js to be rendered. It works but if I didn't spend time trying to learn what it did I would've had a fully functional interactive chart with no idea about the syntax.  Of course I know enough to be able to copy paste, but do you think this is something to be worried about and we each have to understand what it writes ü§î?  Thanks man! Can't wait to meet someday :)",True
@peterpetkanov2699,2023-04-03T18:18:53Z,9,‚ÄòConversational coding‚Äô is very good label. I‚Äôve been experimenting and using it similarly for method blocks. This whole thing feels like another abstraction upwards for a greater productivity,True
@Rex_793,2023-04-03T17:22:16Z,1,Great ending haha üëè,True

@gabrielbarroslinslelisdeol6222,2023-04-03T15:22:37Z,4,"Well, I hope that John Connor will be prepared for the KENMINATOR haha. Jokes aside, the chatGPT had improved a lot my productivity, I can do more in less time. It's a great tool.",True
@rantnhnaketon,2023-04-03T15:10:11Z,5,1:34 see Ken's chat history üòÇ,True
@jamesscouten2966,2023-04-03T13:38:27Z,17,"One of the things I've loved with chatGPT is that it understands the ""why"" so if you're trying to solve a problem, and it's giving you code you don't understand why it's there, you can ask why it is, and it will give a detailed breakdown to explain it to you so you aren't just flying blind.   That's just as helpful, to me at least, as any of the code it produces.",True
@ajohny8954,2023-04-03T13:25:40Z,10,"Any ideas what this means for the data science / AI job market?   I started a masters in data science in February, coming from Finance. I love this stuff, so I‚Äôll just go through with it regardless, but it now seems to me that there will be 0 need for junior data scientists when I finish my masters next February",True
