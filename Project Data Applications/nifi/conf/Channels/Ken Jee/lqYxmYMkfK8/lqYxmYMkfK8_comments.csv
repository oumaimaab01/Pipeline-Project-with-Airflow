@KenJee_ds,2023-07-22T09:35:50Z,1,What do you think? Is the code interpreter worth the hype or is it everything you dreamed of?  Let me know ðŸ‘‡,True
@SaidThaher,2023-08-20T13:55:22Z,1,U forgot to mention that ita just a couple of months old .. and its a beta version ðŸ˜‚..,True
@miwata8828,2023-08-02T02:44:36Z,1,"On point with the solution, exactly the route I chose... thanks for the video.",True
@theReuven,2023-07-29T09:54:55Z,1,"Ai really could replace data analysts, but the ai tools are becoming less effective because the job market is not prepare to a ai replace. So, we need advantage tine to prepare us. It's s my opinion.",True
@Xnozea,2023-07-23T17:09:18Z,2,"People are wasting their time optimizing their prompts. Meanwhile you can code the same task with Pandas and re-use the script whenever you want with less text. I mean I learnt annotating text in my plots with Matplotlib once, now whenever I need to annotate I turn back to my old code and use it.",True

@Mutual_Information,2023-07-22T19:36:25Z,2,"Well said. I've been using ChatGPT as a coding assistant, originally motivated from a feeling of productivity-FOMO, and am now familiar with its limitations. The biggest one is in the workflow you mention, where you have to supervise the code. The productive boost is from ""writing every line"" to ""checking every line"", which is an improvement, but not a job-destroying-10X-er that headlines would have us believe.",True
@dikshyakasaju7541,2023-07-22T14:06:25Z,1,"I couldn't agree more. The Code Interpreter is a valuable tool, but its level of maturity is not yet sufficient to replace any jobs entirely.",True
@pr0skis,2023-07-22T13:53:13Z,0,ChatGPT is like spell check. Ever wonder why so many native English speakers can't spell or use correct grammar? ChatGPT has it's uses but most people will just be turned into even dumber useless eaters.,True
@ayushvatsal,2023-07-22T13:14:50Z,2,"Its interesting how anyone who finds the code interpreter to be ""the best thing ever"", has NEVER worked with data. People just don't seem to understand that the code interpreter, even if it worked flawlessly, is a very minor part of what Data Analysts do. No, it won't kill any new jobs, at least not the way it is now.",True
@fawazalsaif600,2023-07-22T12:59:45Z,1,"Hello Ken, Thanks for the video. I relate to the points you mentioned in the video.  I think that the code interpreter lacks something else as well that might be more important for an analyst. Tgat is memory. If you decide to resume your analysis later on in the the say, you practically need to restart your analysis if you didn't explicitly ask chatgpt to generate your files for download.   And even then, you need to re-explain it to chatgpt and give it the files again as it would have discarded the files/dataframes etc... that it created while doing the analysis.  That was a big turn off for me when I tried the interpreter a few days ago. I was doing an analysis,  and decided to re-do it using to code interpreter to compare. I was impressed until I had this limitation!  Thanks again!",True

@leonlow9911,2023-07-22T10:22:51Z,4,It has only been out for less than a year though,True
@piyushzope10,2023-07-22T09:55:47Z,7,So it's true... It's good extension for someone's learning... Apart from that one need to put good amount of efforts...,True
