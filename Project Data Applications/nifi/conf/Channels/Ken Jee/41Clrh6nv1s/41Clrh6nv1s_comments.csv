The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University's program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it.

I've been in the Marketing field for over 5 years & I decided this isn't the field that I wish to continue perusing.  Since a lot of companies require Master's degree as a minimum requirement for a Data Scientist position. I conducted MSc programs search that would have low entry requirements considering that I come from Business major, and  I came across ""Eastern University"" Data Science Accelerated (7 Weeks) Online MSc, which I applied to & waiting a response from the admission office.  I compared the curriculum to other universities, & I noticed that Cloud Computing & Algorithms are not covered.  My Question: If I proceed with this low entry barrier University (If Accepted) considering my lack of technical knowledge coming from a Business Major (Learning Python & SQL on my own) - Will I be able to land a job after finishing the program? since the university isn't well recognized or hiring relies on sharpened skills? - Does the curriculum cover the needed practical knowledge on the job? - What are the areas/topics that you see important and are not listed in the curriculum?  Below are the information of the program, if you could spare 15 minutes of your time to give me a candid opinion. - https://www.eastern.edu/academics/colleges-seminary/college-health-and-sciences/departments/department-mathematical-5  - https://www.eastern.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-data-science  Thank you & Happy Holidays",True

I certainly don't mind it... I found some courses on Coursera about those topics... I am not ruling out taking those courses in 2021. Engineers that are willing to get involved with those topics are rare, so familiarity with such issues can be very valuable to employer... it is just an idea at this point, no decisions have been made).

One thing I would love to add to those seeking their first job is to ignore job titles, and be open to positions such as ""BI Analyst/Engineer, Data Analyst, etc"", especially if you are entry level for several reasons  1) I was a BI associate and had opportunities to work on ML. Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen ""data scientists"" who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2)  If you want to be a data scientist, you'll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it's taking 1 step back to take 3 forward.  and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing ""cool"" projects. A lot of companies aren't ready for advanced ML/AI. You will be more miserable creating a data science project which will never be put into production than creating a Tableau Dashboard that the whole business will use.  Here’s to a great 2021!",True

I'll do my best to finish by january 1st so I can join you in the #66DaysOfData.

@happyllama4153,2020-12-19T14:41:37Z,1,"There is so much free and good source out there about data science and so many ways to learn it... As someone just starting their data science journey and someone who is struggling with ADHD I was so overwhelmed and confused. If anyone is in my situation I've found ""Siraj Raval - Learn Data Science in 3 Months"" video helpful. You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice:  you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you've learned over time :) Good luck everyone!",True
@swarnimadubey,2020-12-19T14:28:07Z,1,"You're just the best! I started the 66 data journey with you but wasn't able to keep up, but you always motivate me, hope to be more sincere this time. A structured curriculum should be made, at least for me to be more, you know,  sincere. Maybe starting with Kaggle and online courses.. So many different courses, competition, everything gets me so overwhelmed, maybe because I just look through it instead of starting, but not this time, I will make use of time! Listening to you today, made my day! Thanks, KJ Merry Christmas!",True

@Major_Data,2020-12-19T14:13:57Z,10,"My first project for 2021, which I plan to complete during the 66 days:  I think the Marine Corps is stratifying its officer corps through selection of all schools and command opportunities through selection boards, or panels. I believe these boards are subject to heavy confirmation bias and anchoring.  I'm going to analyze the recidivism rate of the boards, using SQL joins (which i know how to do, sort of...) and web scraping, which i don't know at all. Planning to learn enough of that over Christmas to get the job done.",True

I feel the urge to jump ahead but I am committing to finishing the machine learning course from google because I know I need more of a foundation. Should not take long, I plan on starting my first project this week.   I think it would be cool for me to do a sort of reaction/breakdown of this video and how it relates to my journey for a more in the dirt perspective if that's ok with you. (not that your perspective isn't good, just that I don't need to start over because I have barely even started, I think you know what I mean haha)",True
