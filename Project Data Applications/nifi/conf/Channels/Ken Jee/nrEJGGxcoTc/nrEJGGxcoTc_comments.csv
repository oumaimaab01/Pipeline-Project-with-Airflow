@Z3DZ3R0,2021-09-16T20:03:13Z,2,"I agree with most of the things you said about the algorithms being so good and that it would be very inefficient for your phone to listen constantly to everything. Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider.  However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. ""Ok google"", or ""hey Siri"" the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad. In essence they don't actually analyze all the things you say, they just listen for some keywords that they are interested in.",True

@BharatR97,2021-07-08T16:13:44Z,1,"@Ken Jee, if this is really the case that companies (like Google, Facebook) are planning to limit the amount of tracking in one way, does it point to the fact that they are already using other means of tracking and who knows if that's more invasive As people (aspiring and/or working) in the Data Profession, it's probably up to us to use the algorithm more efficiently üòè, but who can say the same for others?",True

@arthurmiller5276,2021-07-06T15:08:06Z,2,"It's also been suggested that phones and other devices aren't actually listening to US but high pitched tones in the audio of TV and radio programming and commercials. Just one more way to get insight into consumers' likes and dislikes.   Personally, while I don't like the idea of eavesdropping and / or collecting my data (not that we probably haven't already given permission in the fine print of the voluminous service agreements), but I do wish if they ARE going to use the information they're gathering they would do a better job of suggesting things I'd actually want instead of things I DON'T want. Unfortunately we're years away (hopefully) from ""Minority Report"" where sensors identify us as we walk around and deliver targeted ads on the fly.",True

@michaelnurse9089,2021-07-04T12:03:57Z,0,"I think you are a bit na√Øve - 90% of people who can do something profitable but naughty without reasonable fear of getting caught simply do it. Endless university social experiments have proven this. I think that when they do it, they make sure it is hidden behind layers of plausible deniability - so the component that listens is purchased from a third party and it was some 'bad man hacker from Russia' who broke into the server room through the roof and so on. They will make sure their reputation stays clean even if it means running a 'black ops' operations where the people who do the work have no idea who they are working for. Only an Edward Snowden type event will blow the lid off - and that will be very unprofitable for the individual concerned.",True
@michaelnurse9089,2021-07-04T11:57:37Z,0,For a while less reputable apps were playing and listing for sounds above human hearing limits. They could tell who you were associating with outside of the digital world and then sell that info to whoever wanted it.,True

@AssadJawaid,2021-07-03T15:09:04Z,2,"Insightful video. I've got smart ho e devices and I do believe Google assistant has the tech to listen in on my conversations, but if I'm getting value out of it, then I tend to just let it be. I'll use/allow certain platforms to have access and not others. We have somewhat of a control over how our info is shared, but it's not right in front of us. Hope Apple, Google, and others can make it more clear and simple how to control tracking.   Excellent video to watch before bed. Have a good weekend. üôè",True

@jamesscouten2966,2021-07-03T13:26:10Z,4,"Your explanation makes a lot of sense when you look at it from the outside. The bandwidth needed to listen and store all audio to target ads is beyond comprehension.   Look, Google gets the lionsshare of their revenue from advertising. I believe it's in the 90% range. If they aren't helping business owners grow their businesses, they stop making that money,  so if they tell you they are going to use less tracking on you, it's not out of the goodness of their heart.....it's because they can accomplish the same goals with less resources.",True

I haven‚Äôt so much as typed a French translation into my phone.  However after a night at a friends with our kids I had been speaking a bit of French to him and the kids. The next two days several French ads started appearing when browsing and recommended videos on French started appearing on YouTube.  Now some of you might think, oh it's just that they used the ""friend"" algorithm and figured they would send you ads in french.  Except that I live in Thailand, and I don't get ads in Thai....why?  Because I don't speak any Thai and never have, despite obvious amounts of Thai being spoken around me, I never speak it so it has never picked up my voice speaking Thai.",True
