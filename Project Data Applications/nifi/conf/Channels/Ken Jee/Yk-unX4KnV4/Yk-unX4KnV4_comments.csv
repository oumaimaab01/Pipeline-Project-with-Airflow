Anyway, tutorial sounds amazing and I'll come back once I have the patience or a clean computer.  AFTER A FEW DAYS ... Tutorial is very good and I finaly got it working. However, it was easier for me to do it without conda and relying on the things I know pyenv and pip and it works just fine on python 3.10. Thanks for your excellent work.üòÄ",True
