@OT-tn7ci,2021-03-30T07:05:34Z,1,"man...you are a legend..I wanna get into data science..I had loved this field since i was literally 8 years old, I always loved to keep stock of all my stuff, toys, books etc, i started with maintaining a work book on my notebook, even though i barely knew how to write lol, and then i started using MS Access, Loved it so much as a kid, it was mostly DBA than data science though, until I started watching a lot of football, tennis etc, try and analyse the data from each match and started to build etc etc yk how it goes and today about a decade later, I am super interested in the field.. I know basic Python, R, Power BI, MS Analysis services, etc etc, But i wanna know a how to get self taught a good path to follow, hope anyone could point me in the right direction, thank you..",True
@chaitanyasharma6270,2021-03-19T09:01:17Z,0,9:28 why do we have to use dict.fromkeys() ?,True
@krews2,2021-03-16T22:10:46Z,1,"Yeah plotly is pretty nifty, but I have a hard time understanding the logic of how to do things past the more basic plots because the documentation can be a little lacking when trying to customize something. I did some poker analysis using plotly and can understand the struggle.",True
@fgnb-md4ln,2021-02-18T01:55:46Z,1,"Thanks for sharing this, Ken. Looks amazing and that's what I need. When I try to follow ur way to code, I found an easier way to do that in 14:22, which is in ""In [12]"" (the heatmap part). Actually we can order the data by ""df.sort_values(by=['Q1', 'Q6'])"" before we plot the heatmap.",True
@tombra4ril,2021-02-10T09:55:57Z,1,This was really helpful. Followed the tutorial to the end and would say plotly is a very nice tool for interactive graphs and plots. Thanks a lot for making this available.,True

@davidwashington4282,2021-02-08T11:04:49Z,1,Plotly is not showing up in Jupyter lab.

@tengkuizman1954,2021-01-19T09:13:58Z,1,"Hi im curious about the code list(dict.fromkeys([i.split('_')[0] for i in df_fin.columns])). Why does for question 7 for example has only one in the list where it has like 12 parts. If you split it should not it be Q7, Q7, Q7, Q7....repeated 12 times. Is it because in dictionary you cannot have duplicated keys?",True
@kabbasal-saadi6751,2021-01-18T19:28:42Z,2,You are really making a difference by showing the steps and hands on methodology of the work that a dat scientist does!  Thank you!,True
@kaulpelly,2021-01-17T18:41:24Z,1,"Great video. I am new Python so its great to see some uses for dictionaries and some of your clever aggregation techniques. I completely relate to the Plotly struggle as I decided R Shiny, rather than Tableau or Power BI, was the the tool for my Masters project in Data Vis. I spent days and days working out the kinks in all my visuals but it came in really useful when I did my dissertation and had to visualise my results. Plotly is painful but powerful.",True

@gregjacobs110680,2021-01-13T15:24:41Z,2,Ken - Really enjoyed this video.  I think it is incredibly valuable to see your approach to learning a new Python package - especially to those new to the field that are struggling with imposter syndrome.  Googling and seeing how other people have tackled a problem/project you are working on (and even using some of their code) is perfectly fine and in lots of cases probably the most efficient way of learning a new data analysis method/skill/etc.  I can't wait for the logical next iteration of this style of video - livestreaming your work!,True
@paulntalo1425,2021-01-13T00:21:22Z,1,Thank you for the training. Am learning how to approach a data set from a data science view. Am two months into learning data science Msc.,True
@sid4752,2021-01-12T09:53:23Z,2,"Ken , what do you think about Tensorflow? I use a macbook and have been stuck with issues (modulenotfound and PIL errors) since a week. I've literally followed every single stackoverflow and github issue thread but nothing seems to work. Does tf, in general, doesnt work on MacOS?  This is my error(if anyone's wondering):  !python {'/content/generate_tfrecord.py'} -x {'/content/Training'} -l {'/content/label_map.pbtxt'} -o {ANNOTATION_PATH + '/train.record'} !python {'/content/generate_tfrecord.py'} -x{'/content/Testing'} -l {'/content/label_map.pbtxt'} -o {ANNOTATION_PATH + '/test.record'} running which gives me the error:  Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""/content/generate_tfrecord.py"", line 29, in <module>     from object_detection.utils import dataset_util, label_map_util ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'object_detection' Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""/content/generate_tfrecord.py"", line 29, in <module>     from object_detection.utils import dataset_util, label_map_util ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'object_detection'",True

@twrciv,2021-01-10T04:26:04Z,1,I have a python question: why does the line at 8:55 'qnums = list(dict.fromkeys([.....]))' work?  Shouldn't 'dict.fromkeys' only work for tuples not lists?,True
@MildlyAmusingComedyC,2021-01-09T19:17:57Z,1,So for the first 6 questions (not including the country question) I converted the data types to Categorical and set the order I wanted them within that step. It made it so that the plots I made were in in that order without any additional code in the plotting step. Do you think that would cause any issues down the road with other parts of the process?,True
@jeremynx,2021-01-09T16:39:08Z,1,Thank you very much. Very creative graphs. The most interesting was how you used dictionary for multiple answer questionsüëçüëçüëç,True

I haven't completed a degree and currently have 5 years of experience working IT on government contracts.  Is it recommended that I finish my degree in something on the business side such as finance, learn SQL/python/stats and try to land a BI role?  Or should I go ahead and pursue a science degree such as a bachelor's of science in CS?   Goal is BI/DA --> MLE/DS one day",True
