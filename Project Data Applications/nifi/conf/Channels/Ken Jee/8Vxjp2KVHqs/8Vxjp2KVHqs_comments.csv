@navidtehseen,2024-03-03T10:07:48Z,0,"I am currently working on my projects, and i have a question,  Do the projects needs to be full stack? Or just the notebook, and a detailed report of the analysis and model? Because i feel like it takes a lot of time actually building the apps and deploying them. Thank you in advance!",True
@piyushthakur2386,2021-05-12T14:16:11Z,1,The Q/A session at the last was very important. Got the answer to my own question about beginners projects. Thanks for answering that question Ken.,True
@brentcos9370,2021-01-22T02:46:42Z,7,"I totally agree with you Ken.....people really need to focus on the business results vs. techniques used or programming code. Businesses hire people to solve problems, generate sales, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, etc. All of these things can be quantified to some degree. At a minimum, put some focus on how your project adds value to the organization. Position yourself as not just a data scientist or ML engineer, but also a value-add problem solver and business advisor. You're not in academia, you're in business.",True
@yumitomoonuma3033,2020-11-24T21:46:29Z,1,"Very good advice, I like the honest, detailed responses. Will definitely be dropping you a message when I get some more work done! - mechanical engineer",True

Can you please walk us through the Data-domain (Data Scientist/Data Engineer/Data Analyst) recruitment process in one of ur videos?  I am doing my undergrad in Computer Sc. Engineering. The campus-recruitment at my university is more Dev-intensive, focused on coding, Data-structures and Algorithms... could you suggest me something? Thanks. Ciao!",True
@filipdjokovic3684,2020-09-24T22:08:54Z,1,"hi Ken, really helpful video! Do you have any examples of how to include Github and Git into my routine? (you mentioned it at the end of the video). Do i just focus on getting my project on github or focus on how to store it and present it (if thats the case, is there a tutorial on it or would you be interested in doing some tutorials?). Or is it something totally different.  Keep up the good work!",True

@drewscatterday8020,2020-09-22T21:17:34Z,2,"Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume/portfolio. I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume.   Project A - Kaggle:  - finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts   Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science:  -Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping  -Clean the data  -Do some advanced feature engineering with the data  -Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best  -Create a website and put the end model into production  -write a blog post about the project and its results     Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question. Cheers!",True

I have a query, I have been working as a Data scientist for past 4 years in IT services firm and have delivered projects in Engineering domain(customers in manufacturing , aero, auto etc) . Even though I have some good projects(the ones I delivered for the customers)  to showcase on CV, I don't have a proper GitHub profile because I cant recreate the projects I did in GitHub  because of customer /project confidentiality.  In this case what would be your advice on building a solid GitHub profile, which datasets / project I can work on?",True

@gohnsheinthit5557,2020-09-22T06:23:50Z,2,"Hey Ken, so I have a project where I train a neural network to determine if a piece of text is toxic or not.

@NedalNudals,2020-09-21T18:04:35Z,2,The only project I've completed so far is the titanic set. should I even bother putting this into a portfolio seeing as how everyone has seen it before and it has solutions posted?,True
