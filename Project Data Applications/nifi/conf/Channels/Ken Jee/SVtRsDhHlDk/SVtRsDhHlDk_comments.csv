But still somewhere all this wasn't much appealing and interesting as it was appearing before entering into it. I realized I was not very interested in statistics and probability. And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea.
