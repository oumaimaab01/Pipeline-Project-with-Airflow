@adamgdev,2020-10-27T11:14:58Z,2,Solid video!   I am kind of binging your channel as I am committed to getting a job in Finance with Data Science.  You mentioned  data wrangling being over 50% of the workload at a job.  I am going hard on Pandas and all supporting libraries (2 - 3 hours a day for a couple of months).  Do you think this will cover the data wrangling side or are there other libraries/stacks/tools that I should be getting into?  Thank you for all of the great content!,True

@JanooseCanada,2020-06-07T13:57:15Z,1,I am coming from computer science background. I took lots of stats courses but doesn't seem to sink in into me. I keep using just basic stats for my work in the finance/decision support department in hospital. I am starting to learn Python.

Just if you need an idea regarding new videos, I would be interested in your way to learn and apply new stuff effectively. There is so much to learn on a regular basis. It's currently tough for me to grasp, what is really worth to spend time on (e.g. learning statistics theory vs hand-on experince by try and error).",True
