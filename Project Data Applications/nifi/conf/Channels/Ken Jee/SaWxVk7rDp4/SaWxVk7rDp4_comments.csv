@ej4530,2021-05-14T14:23:56Z,1,"Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for the video! I've been struggling getting into data analytics industry for the past 1 year. After watching your videos, I've tried doing projects from Kaggle, but my technical skills for completing projects on my own are quite not there to show off to hiring managers. I recently was contacted by a recruiting firm that provides SAS training and get assistance getting into a first SAS programmer role, it will take me 3 months to get a certificate and possibly get the role. I'm thinking maybe 1 year of experience as a SAS programmer can help me to get a feeling of data analytics field, and continue to learn Python on the side. Could you advise if this could be a helpful route for me?",True

@skaysyndromes8735,2021-05-13T01:18:11Z,9,Brilliant idea to make short vids like these. And yes I have come to rely on lambda functions more recently after watching your project on data science salary estimates. They keep the code compact and clean.,True
