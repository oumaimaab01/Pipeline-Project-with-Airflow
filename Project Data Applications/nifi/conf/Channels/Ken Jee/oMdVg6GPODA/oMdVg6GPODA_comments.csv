@importdata95,2020-03-25T16:25:33Z,3,The only constant in data science is that it's always changing! It's important to always learn new technologies. Thanks Ken for the motivation!,True
@donnelly5757,2020-03-24T02:55:48Z,1,"Great video as always, but I will say this is a serious understatement.  Now that I'm out of work,  I am ever so glad that I have decided  to pursue this career path. Three great reasons to pursue data science: 1. Do something positive for society and gain a strong sense of purpose. 2. Something to keep the mind stimulated which can greatly help with depression and anxiety. 3. A solid career that can potentially help someone avoid being homeless and going down a dark path. I think these are solid enough reasons to purse this field.",True

@devinhorvay,2020-03-23T15:03:36Z,2,"Great video. When you say you expect the work culture to shift towards employees working from home, do you mean in the short-term i.e. while the pandemic is still going on, or do you see this just being the ""new"" working environment? Interesting insight.",True
@krishnasankar6160,2020-03-23T14:20:00Z,1,Can you suggest a good youtube channel or website for learning a good amount of python for data science.,True
@mohitnagarkoti4086,2020-03-23T14:16:23Z,2,Thankyou ken,True
@justinlam5565,2020-03-23T13:47:28Z,4,Whenever I see that Ken Jee notification I drop everything I'm doing to watch it,True
@AndrewAlarcon17,2020-03-23T13:33:05Z,1,Couldn't agree more. Working on a data set about the virus during this time. So many people have created really insightful notebooks on Kaggle already!,True
@t_tek760,2020-03-23T13:25:02Z,1,"I‚Äôve been learning a lot using my iPhone and I‚Äôve gotten to that stage above the usage of a phone, kind of difficult getting a laptop but hopefully someday  I‚Äôll be able get one to practice with, Thanks for your motivations.",True
