@kimsuarez9027,2020-09-24T15:35:46Z,1,"Hi Ken. Just found your channel recently and itâ€™s been an amazing resource for me. Iâ€™m new to data science and as a former athlete, Iâ€™m hoping to work in sports analytics eventually. However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for 10 years. Based on what youâ€™ve said a few times, it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports? If I wanted to start building my portfolio, would it be weird to have projects in both categories? Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun? A little confused on how I should present myself.",True
@mehrzadm.7464,2020-09-19T06:42:51Z,1,"A question here, Ken: As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project. Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach. I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio, at least until I do a little more advanced projects.",True
@babayaga626,2020-09-18T05:30:32Z,1,"Hey Ken, What kind of projects people with 5 years of exp should have if they are willing to move into Data Science? What extra things do we add to get calls for the interview?",True
@aidanobrien6895,2020-09-15T15:41:56Z,1,"Loving this project/resume series - it's just full of useful tips. I'm just about to start an MSc Data Science and I'm planning to do some project work to complement the course content. I saw that you did your undergraduate in Economics, do you have any tips for an economics undergraduate transitioning to DS?",True
@miguelrosales3930,2020-09-15T14:41:36Z,1,"Amazing! Anyway, this is my first Kaggle project https://www.kaggle.com/miguelrosales/data-analysis-of-house-prices ,  I hope you can check it, Ken! Thank you as always! :)",True

@insigh01,2020-09-14T22:33:57Z,1,"Oh man Ken!  I'm just starting my GA capstone project, and I was always wondering when you would review a capstone project.  This is awesome!  Maybe I'll shoot you a message when my capstone is done after October 12.  Thanks always for what you do!",True
@jimmyaidoo1110,2020-09-14T19:37:53Z,5,"very cool project. The detail in the ReadMe is impressive. As a relative newbie,  this is quite intimidating to me.  Wondering how long it will take me to get to this level of proficiency.",True
@RohanPaul-AI,2020-09-14T18:34:17Z,1,Thanks a ton Ken. The project you selected was really awesome on showing one of the best in class documentation. Learned quite a few points from it. Someday I shall submit my own project for your review. ðŸ™‚,True
@larigiba,2020-09-14T16:59:02Z,1,"Already the 20th episode, wow! It feels like you just started this series yesterday and now 20 episodes in you covered so many different resumes and projects! I believe in general, talking more about the other side is very valuable in conversation. We as humans just like talking about our own views and when a company is hiring, they of course want to know what they can ""get"" from a candidate.",True

@DataProfessor,2020-09-14T15:26:35Z,4,"Awesome video Ken! Cool, I'm early today. Great advice on stressing the value that one can bring to an organization. I really like the organization and layout of the ""Hotel Review NLP"" project, great job Ahilan! The class balancing is also a great way to make the classifier less bias, great job! Oh, and nice mechanical keyboard by the way ðŸ˜Š",True
