@bradams75,2023-03-11T21:10:55Z,0,A few weeks ago I had a conversation with a work colleague on Teams and mentioned the book 'Worker Leadership' and said that it was largely a case study of implementing a program at John Deere Harvester. Then I started getting ads for John Deere Harvester on my phone (a different device). I am a librarian and live in the suburbs. No activity I've performed on my phone would suggest such an ad. My conclusion is that my phone is listening to me.,True
