@devonpeters9458,2021-09-29T00:40:40Z,2,"Thanks for the video. I‚Äôm curious, do you see any benefit to getting an MBA and an MS in DS? I have a scholarship that will pay for most of both, but I‚Äôm also 35 and hesitant to go back to school for that long. If so, would you suggest one before the other? If not, could I still break in to some of the more technical roles with an MBA?",True

@Epipedobatideo,2021-08-01T22:10:41Z,1,"When I was starting my Ph.D. in Computational Biology, I discovered Data Science. Now I'm slowly changing my focus to it. CompBio uses many disciplines and concepts in common with DS, which was a very satisfying discovery when I started to read about DS. I think it's very nice to be called Master, but man, Doctor Weiss sounds *SO evil scientist* that I couldn't help myself when choosing my path. It's just what I wanted since I was 4 LOL But seriously, although I'm just migrating but not there yet, it seems to me that many (or most) areas that include programming and statistics will have a good match in DS.",True

@chacmool2581,2021-05-29T13:12:07Z,1,"Why didn't you choose a master's in Applied Statistics?  I just put in an application for a grad certificate in Applied Stats yesterday. The choice of school was made for me by these factors; 1. No GRE required 2. No recs required 3. Three intakes a year so no waiting till next year 4. Non-exirbitant tuition (under $1,000 per credit) 5. On-line program",True
@thePronto,2021-05-15T04:05:51Z,1,"So, your choice of discipline, or school didn't determine the outcome?  Spoiler alert: it was you.

@lucasfernandes3107,2021-01-04T19:23:05Z,1,"Hello Ken! Thanks for the content!  I recently moved from Brazil to Saint Charles (about 1h from Chicago) so as to stay with my wife and thought that pursuing a masters, instead of only self learning, could give me an edge when looking for a job here. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and am pursuing a masters in data science, preferably in the Chicago area.  Is pursuing a masters a good idea given that I do not currently have a diploma that local employers would recognize? How much does the prestige of the university matter for professional outcome? What is, in your opinion, best for professional outcome? An online but more prestigious degree or an on site but less prestigious degree? In Brazil there is prejudice against online learning. What are your thoughts on University of Illinois at Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology in general, but also regarding their Business Analytics and Data Science masters ? Given that I have what I believe could be considered a ""technical background"" what do you believe would be important in a masters in data science? Hard or soft skills? How was your experience at DePaul? Quality of classes and professional outcome wise.  Sorry for this avalanche of questions. Hope you can answer them as I believe it would be of great help. Thank you!",True
@bianchialex,2020-12-08T13:20:18Z,3,Side comment you made that I find really interesting. That the education was similar everywhere you went but the students were all different. Part of the reason I want to go to a master's program or top company is to surround myself with different people than my upper middle tier college (Seton Hall). Would love to see a video talking about that it even interview you on the topic.,True
