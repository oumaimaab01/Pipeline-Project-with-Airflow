@m12327,2020-08-23T01:47:53Z,0,"This seems like the kind of top-tier job you would get in silicon valley. I'm from the midwest US and really want to see the more mundane and less glamorous jobs that are out here, since I don't want to leave behind my family and friends and life in indiana to chase a dream job. I know someone who works as a data analyst for CANON and a lot of his work is SQL queries and relational databases and excel spreadsheets. Don't get me wrong -- your job looks amazing -- but it looks really competitive (like 200+ applications per job for these sorts of things) and something that would be near impossible with my background in the humanities.  edit: You know, I just re-read this comment and it sounded rude. So let me just say that I do really appreciate your content and videos!! :-)",True
