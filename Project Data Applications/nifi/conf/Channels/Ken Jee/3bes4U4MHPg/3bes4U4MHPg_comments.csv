I have read so many comparison about it but some of these info are outdate or 1side opinion. I want ur opinion on this. Here is my goal: Owming my own business and using Data Science to give my business an edge over my competition.   But now I came across a new major call ""Business Analytic"". I was wondering if Data Science are too broad of a subject for my goal in comparison to Business Analytic which sound more specific?.",True
