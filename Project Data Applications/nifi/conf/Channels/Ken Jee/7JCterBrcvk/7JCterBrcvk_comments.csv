@aarons5205,2021-06-23T15:45:21Z,1,"Love Cal Newport! I think a lot of what he discusses on how to work could potentially help with some of this! His book Deep Work is a great place to start, or his podcast Deep Questions. It‚Äôs helped me at times manage my learning with a full time job and a very busy family!",True
@heather7324,2021-06-22T08:42:08Z,1,"After completing my BSc Honours (biology) degree in January this year I started a self-study journey into data science. I went over various resources including Kens and Tinas YT channels which helped. In the past 5 months my main accomplishment was the IBM certificate in Data Science and I‚Äôm so happy to say I secured my first job as a Jnr Data Scientist starting last week!!!   It‚Äôs possible guys, keep up the hard work!",True
@joeltorres1237,2021-06-12T04:17:35Z,2,"Will a bachelor's degree in kinesiology and master's in public health be helpful in a field like data analytics? I've taken classes like bio stats. I enjoy fitness, sports performance etc. I consider myself a sports junkie. I hear in data science employers want a masters degree. But what if in another field that's not data science.",True

@nlay42,2021-06-05T21:45:58Z,2,"Ken, I like your videos very much! They are both informative and inspirational. You have a genuine understanding of what beginners encounter with data science. Thank you so much for dedicating your time to creating the videos!",True
@arunkhrishna790,2021-06-03T05:35:20Z,4,Hey Ken! Recently many articles and news sites stated that data science is gonna extinct in the future. Is it really true? Could u share your opinion about this.,True
@learningdata,2021-06-02T04:59:19Z,3,Thanks a lot for this video! I thought I was the only one having these negative feelings along my journey. This really gives me hope that I can someday be as good as you in data science. :D,True
@thepythondiary1011,2021-06-01T09:29:32Z,1,"hello, I would really appreciate an advice on choosing between data science and software engineering. I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion.  After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python. Since then I developed a true passion for programming.  I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these. During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics.  I am really undecided on which career to pursue.  These are the things I like mostly: - programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering) - using Git and Github - discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science) - creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person. - languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue)  I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely ""make more sense"" given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis. I do not think I would enjoy working with math every day.  Thank to anyone who took the time to read, sorry for being too long :)",True

@arthurmiller5276,2021-05-31T12:49:19Z,5,"The ‚ÄúImpostor Syndrome‚Äù usually refers to the nagging fear of being labeled a fraud for having a job we don‚Äôt feel we‚Äôre qualified for or receiving an award or recognition that we don‚Äôt feel we actually deserve. A variation should be called the ‚ÄúAverage Person Syndrome‚Äù for the frustrating feeling of not being ‚Äúenough‚Äù. News and social media frequently show us things like grade school students developing apps or web sites to address some issue of the Covid pandemic, or podcasters, YouTubers and Twitter tech influencers with thousands of followers. This can leave ‚Äúaverage‚Äù people second guessing their ideas and projects as not being significant ‚Äúenough‚Äù when compared to others on display.",True
@mariopaul6505,2021-05-31T12:44:11Z,3,"Heavily relate to feeling overwhelmed at times!  I've always felt overwhelmed when I think about how vast the field of data science is and all that there is to learn and keep up with.  What helped me was understanding that I will not 100% know and understand everything and that is okay, nobody does:)  Taking small baby steps and learning through 1 project as a time has been a huge success for me & for those trying to learn, I highly recommend the ""Data Science Project By Scratch"" series on Ken's channel!",True

@theoutlet9300,2021-05-30T03:58:46Z,4,"The best way to overcome discouragement i found is to accept failure. Accept that you are gonna fail but also have the confidence that you are gonna get through it if you work hard. Recently was given a task which I thought I could never do.

@DataProfessor,2021-05-29T08:16:38Z,3,"Great video as always Ken! For me, re-evaluating my Why helps to bring perspectives and motivation to get back up again. As you suggested, changing environments or taking a walk does really help to declog a stuck state. The realization that it‚Äôs okay not to know everything does give great comfort, great tips!",True

@AssadJawaid,2021-05-29T03:24:50Z,2,My last project I decided to use sklearn and ended up with an overfitted and underfitted model. Definitely felt discouraged and realized taking a nap or tackling it after not thinking about it helped to feel more confident. Another is learning so much based on job postings. Have learned so much for Data Science and looking at SQL feels overwhelming. Thanks for this video and I'll probably watch it a few more times to help me.,True
@taylorbosier,2021-05-29T03:18:59Z,2,"Ken, I think that my therapist has helped me a lot in my journey as a Business Analyst. They have allowed me to get to the root of my problem, which is exactly what data science is about. I highly recommend pursuing EMDR with a trained therapist to tackle the core issues of one's character. This therapeutic journey has allowed me to get over myself and to just jump straight into my work problems.",True

@LukeBarousse,2021-05-28T19:52:36Z,5,2:46 Ken very much resonate with this of taking the time to think and contemplate.  I do this with short bike breaks during the day and it's done wonders with helping me come up with solutions to complex problems!! Thanks for sharing your insights on this important topic!!,True
@BharatR97,2021-05-28T18:23:49Z,2,"Wow awesome @Ken Jee! Just acknowledging that everyone has these feelings by itself makes it easier, especially coming from you! And like other comments here, sometimes switching the problem/changing the tool to solve the problem also seems to help, maybe that's a point to add",True
@Xavier-ww9zy,2021-05-28T17:21:15Z,6,"This was awesome! I've been feeling discouraged because I would do well in interviews, even receiving compliments for my growth and enthusiasm, but then I'd be rejected, only to be invited to compete again. After 6 months of this, I've got an internship! Thank you for teaching me how to stick it out and go on, Ken. God bless you!",True

@Ibraheem_ElAnsari,2021-05-28T15:40:13Z,5,"If I could add one thing to the last part of the video; something that has helped me a lot is changing the tool you use if you're really stuck .. I got stuck so bad creating a Dashboard that gets updated daily in R Shiny and got so frustrated .. I completely switched the language and did it on streamlit, I finished it all in one day afterwards ! Just like Tina once told me that you shouldn't be married to one course, the same thing could be said for DS tools ! I think this is super important because many people spend days working on one thing until they quit completely ..",True
@leavonfletcher4197,2021-05-28T14:51:06Z,2,Really really really excellent video!  I needed to hear this.  I just need to concentrate on my classes and keep moving forward.  By any chance have you heard anything about the PG-AIML program at the University of Texas?,True
@nelsondevera9178,2021-05-28T14:39:39Z,5,Thank you for this video. But the bird pooped at 9:34 lol.,True
@_wassaname_,2021-05-28T14:33:04Z,2,You feel even more discouraged if you are from India. Here in India as a computer engineer or computer science student the 2 mainstream ways of getting an internship or a placement is to do Development or do Competitive Programming and get a SWE job.  If you choose Data Science and if you manage to get a job you will be paid half the amount of a SWE as a fresher.  It leads to doubt... Am I doing the right thing?,True
@anthonyabdo1735,2021-05-28T14:22:21Z,3,"Great content as always. I have a question, maybe it will help others too.   I'm starting fresh in the DS journey. There's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and I felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too: One of the big reasons I decided to switch to DS is being an International career; I saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like Software Engineers ^^).  However, I sensed that it's not the case with DS? I sensed like if I joined a certain industry as Data Scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. For example, you joined the DS world in the sport industry, right? Do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...). Landing a job in a different company/industry is easy?  Your opinion is much appreciated!",True
@piyushzope10,2021-05-28T14:03:48Z,9,"Hey, Ken. I have small request for you.  Can you also pass my prize to the next winner. You already have given me many resources through this competition and those are really useful for me.  I'm really gratefulü§ó to you for your support and efforts for the community.",True
@GriefHC,2021-05-28T14:01:18Z,4,"Great video, Ken. What I realized overtime is that you‚Äôll never be free of worry, anxiety or feelings of inadequacy. But what I‚Äôve learned to accept is that these feelings are your body and mind‚Äôs way of self-regulating to push you past your comfort zone.   Life is a struggle, learning new fields of study is a struggle, but as long as you learn to accept the struggle and push forward regardless, when you zoom out you should get a better picture in how much you‚Äôve accomplished over a course of time. And you should be very proud about that.",True

@aamnasuhail4468,2021-05-28T13:27:04Z,6,I was feeling discouraged but I didn't gave up the idea of diving into the field. That speaks in itself  that I wanted to learn this .  Great Video Ken!!! I needed  it.,True
@piyushzope10,2021-05-28T13:23:46Z,3,"Yes, It's is really important to control time which we are spending on using tech products. Having some physical exercise and mediation is essential.   During these days mostly people are following WFH pattern and spending too much time on using laptops and mobile phones including me but I'm trying to set boundaries to it because it has bad impacts on our health.

@codingcrashkurse6429,2021-05-28T13:16:49Z,3,"In the last two weeks we set up a model registry with mlflow which allows to write model artifacts to the hdfs. We had deploy that in our Kubernetes Cluster and make that work with the hdfs. Volumes, kerberos tickets, different nodes. I even had a feeling of quitting the job because I am too dumb to be honest. In the end, we made it. We have to love the struggle, we don¬¥t get paid well because it¬¥s easy, but because it¬¥s hard.  Splitting it up really helps, taking a break helps. Good advice in the video :-). Pro tip: To make it really stick, teach a colleague about it or make a youtube video about it.
