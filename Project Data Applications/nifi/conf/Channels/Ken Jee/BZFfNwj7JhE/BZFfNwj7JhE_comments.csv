@paulabatistadesouza,2020-07-10T14:13:59Z,3,"I have a business role in Operations / Planning, but all my major accomplishments were related to collecting, treating and analyzing data in Excel and Power BI. I am currently learning Python, R and statistics to do it more professionally, and in the future I would like to be able to do predictions/ML to bring even more value to the business. I fear that strict data roles may get me too far from the business routine, what could be a problem as I do enjoy living in the supply chain area. I am not sure if being a Data Scientist is my ultimate goal, but I also don't know which roles would be more aligned to my objectives.

Just a small question, im currently an industrial engineering student (so i have a good background in statistics) and have enrolled in the EDX IBM data science certificate program. I have finished all the courses (excpet for the SQL one which i will start soon) and feel like im fine with the coding and concepts (regressions, clustering, classification, etc. ) but do not know where to go from here since i have only worked on 1 project (the capstone from the course).
