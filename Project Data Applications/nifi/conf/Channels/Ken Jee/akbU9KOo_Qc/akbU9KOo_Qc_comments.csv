@chinny872,2020-08-30T18:25:12Z,1,"Hey Ken!¬†Thanks for the tips; I‚Äôm steadily habituating many of these practices, and with greater intention after watching the video.   Question: what are you using that small whiteboard on your desk for? I have a similar one that I‚Äôm trying to determine a purpose for. . .",True
@neroandjohn4493,2020-08-19T18:49:19Z,4,"Thank you for the tips Ken! I especially agree with the ""starting small"" part. In the past, I used to just consume most of my daily time to that new habit during the initial phase. I would just see starting small as being ""not good enough"". However, I realized that this was causing me to have burnouts frequently. So even though changing your ""bad habits"" is hard, I am trying to apply this advice and I can already see its benefits.",True

@drewrobinson2413,2019-12-13T13:34:02Z,1,"Ken, great video. Can you post that spreadsheet to github?    I come from a non technical background. My major is supply chain management with a minor in information systems. I took a data science course and did well in it. The course mainly covered more advanced statistical concepts, not so much of programming (I lack in computer skills the most). I really enjoyed the course. I currently work as a business analyst. I am considering taking your advice to get a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan. Thanks for the information you provide on this channel!",True
