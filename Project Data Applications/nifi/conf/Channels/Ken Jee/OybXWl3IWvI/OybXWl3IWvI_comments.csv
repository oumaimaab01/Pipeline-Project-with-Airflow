@Eta_Carinae__,2023-01-09T17:57:14Z,1,"I'm just discovering your channel, and I can see how on top of replies you are - big props btw - so I have a question: I think I'm coming at DS backwards from most people. I'm very interested and inspired by research around the areas of Bayesian dynamics, self organised criticality and emergent control systems - that kind of thing, as it applies to intelligence. Do you see the industry, or a subset of it, leveraging any of these kinds of ideas from the ""quantitative life sciences"" broadly, as opposed to say _just_ neural networks/Bayesian statistics/etc. in particular? Or, at least do you see a problem or class of problems in industry that seems to demand more exotic methods, like the aforementioned?  I'd like to try work on a project, but I can't think of anything very interesting. ChatGPT reccomended I do something that can measure the phase changes of a distributed neural network, which sounds awesome, but I don't know how industry would care about something like that, aside from a rather uninspiring ""making DNNs more efficient"". Thanks in advance.",True
@Eta_Carinae__,2023-01-09T17:28:59Z,1,"For me it's leverage, I think that's most important. I need to be irreplaceable, such that people who mistreat me have that sword of Damocles hanging over them always - that being the implicit threat of me going somewhere else. I hope I could obtain leverage through novelty, which I guess counts as a value, but it's anscilliary to leverage in some part. As it pertains to DS, I'm most excited by novelty through methods, rather than 'just being really good with SQL' or something. I know it's an undervalued essential, but this whole prompt is a pipe-dream so...",True
