@e.i.l.9584,2022-12-19T22:56:12Z,0,"Hi everyone, I have a weird background to get into datascience and just wondering on everyone's advice on what program would be best suitable to get into data science. I have a double bachelors in neuroscience and psychology with a specialisation in statistics and a minor in AI and data science. This year I'm on exchange to study mathematics, logic/descrete math, and data visualisation. I am good at R and okay at python. My options for the master are: Artificial Intelligence (very heavy math focused having to prove most models by hand), Statistics & data science (math & R, little bit of python and SQL), or data science (focused on Python, bit SQL, tiny bit R, no math). What would be best to get into the field of data science or machine learning engineering. I really like statistics and machine learning. I'm afraid if I go for just the data science one it could be just a hype diploma but it's the most applied to work in the field, the others are more theoretical but therefore more future proof. Does this even matter after you get your first jobs? Would bootcamps be better for one or the other? any pros or cons? Thank you everyone for your time/reading Best",True
