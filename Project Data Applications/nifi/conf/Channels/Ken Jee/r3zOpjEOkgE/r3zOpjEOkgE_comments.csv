@singhmastr,2023-08-29T06:19:30Z,1,"Great info. People should narrow their job search to 2-3 industry's and then have several projects for each industry. Or have some amazing projects that cross over realistically.  If interested in real estate and want to work for a company life Redfin/Zillow, have projects that look at real estate.",True
@eric_welch,2023-07-08T04:16:50Z,2,Great advice!!  So let's say that I want to end up with a data science position related to the music industry or to soccer in some way.  Do you have any suggestions on how to tailor learning in that way??  Just look for relevant data and try to build a presentation??  Reach out to someone in one of those industries??  Thanks as always!!,True
