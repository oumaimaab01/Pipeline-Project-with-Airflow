@karishma3346,2023-02-23T17:48:10Z,0,"I recently started my first real data science project since I always practice projects using hands on projects on youtube and work step by step with the youtuber. This first project I have started is from Zindi and I am working with this project for over a month now...I definitely learnt wayy more than I expected.  At first I was just doing what i learnt from the other hands on projects and I was like ""How come this project feels easy ?"" Then bam! I asked a mentor to guide me and I found this project is wayyyyy complicated and advanced for me..mind you this is supposed to be a begginer friendly project...if anyone can assist me I would really appreciate it.   PS : I have been learning DS for 8 months now but I don't feel ready to apply for any internships.  I only have kaggle Certifications ...also let's connect on linkedin..would love to learn from everyone",True

All US techs are forbidden for Syria by US rules. This is not a civilized act from a great country like US.
