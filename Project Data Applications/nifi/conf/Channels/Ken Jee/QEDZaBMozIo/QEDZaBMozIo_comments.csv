@nancycarlson548,2024-04-22T20:44:23Z,2,"Like it or not time does lay a path in front of us. What I mean by that is today we choose our best path based on our past and what we hope for our future. As time clicks forward, our current today is becoming exponentially different from your yesterday, making yesterday's choices diametrically different from our todays realities. In my case, I started as an art student, became a fashion designer, who looked at that landscape and chose to be a small business owner, who then saw technology would rule this domain, educated myself in the ways of programming and database design to build my own on-line business, only to realize after 25 years of success that the inventory investment to grow at the rate necessary for success was more than I wanted to commit to, leading to going back to school to get a formal education in Data Science from UC Irvine, which has led to now starting my new career as and Energy Analyst at the California Energy Commission. My advice is to stay connected to today's reality and be open and agile enough to update your best choice for your best future, cause guys I guarantee you its going to change so you might as well enjoy the ride. Bravo Ken for staying connected to your reality! I am looking forward to watching your next chapter.",True
@LukeBarousse,2024-04-22T20:22:13Z,10,"Ken, As one of the first OG Data Science Youtubers, you've had a tremendous impact not only on the community at large but also on my journey.  I remember first watching your content when struggling to learn everything in this field and then you made me feel like this was possible. I remember saying to myself: ""Heck, if Ken can do this, so can I""üòú  Super stoked for your next journey with the Expontial Athlete; I can already see the passion in the episodes you've made so I have a feeling this is gonna be epic!

@jamesscouten2966,2024-04-22T10:48:52Z,1,"Funny. No more than a week ago, I was driving and randomly thought, ""I haven't seen Ken post a video in a while.""  No idea if this is a good idea or not, but Billy Walters,  who is the greatest sports gambler of all time might have some insight into many analytics you're looking for as he assigns a point value to every athlete that matters in a sports outcome. He might have both tangible and intangible aspects that athletes possess that help them be a better athlete. If you could get him to open up as he has been willing to do recently as he looks to pass his legacy on, you might get some of what you are looking for.   Will definitely follow that project as well!",True
