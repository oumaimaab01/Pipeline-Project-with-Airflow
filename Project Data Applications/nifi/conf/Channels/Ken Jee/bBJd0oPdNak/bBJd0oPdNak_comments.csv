@Mellowyellow8888,2022-05-08T06:39:49Z,4,man i'm baffled with the level of questions in the chat.. seems like basic questions from people that haven't done their own research which have been asked many years ago and posted everywhere on the internet.. this is a gathering of people that are working or involved in the industry for a while and you ask them such basic questions?..   Ask more inspiring questions.. like how has the problems they've been asked to solve evolved from when they started to now? How have they evolved/leveled up in terms of their own problem solving skills..   What are the views of management on current data scientists.. which any views of fast up and coming analytics/ML/DL techniques (I'm aware these guys might not be plugged into current academic research..) they might not know this..  these are really things people should be asking.. as we get a glimpse if DS jobs are moving towards in the future (good/bad)..,True

@Ludicrous2019,2022-05-08T01:11:29Z,7,"Thanks for the Town Hall, everyone! Really enjoyed learning more about you all personally and professionally. I had a couple more lingering questions if you can select one to respond to or both, I would appreciate it:  1- Do you think Microsoft Azure certificates are worthwhile when it comes to job search?   2- What do you think are some strong non-traditional master's degree areas that you see breaking into data science? I'm not talking about statistics, computer science, analytics, or physics degrees. Are you seeing more healthcare and other STEM/non-STEM master's degree holders pivoting into data?  Also, if yall are still in Austin, definitely check out The Oasis on Lake Travis restaurant. Very scenic on the lake, it's perfect and the food is great!",True
