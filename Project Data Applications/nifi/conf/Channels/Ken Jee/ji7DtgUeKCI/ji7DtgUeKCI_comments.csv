@mdrafatsiddiqui,2022-07-18T09:37:43Z,6,1. What you will be learning?  i.e. Curriculum 2. Job Placement Opportunities? Check the stats and connect with alumni 3. Class diversity and flexibility i.e. look for institutions offering courses you want 4. Place of education i.e. online or offline (based on personal preference) 5. Duration  - full-time or part time  6. Research and Internship i.e. need real world experience (co-op etc.) 7. Monetary considerations - may not get job after masters.  8. International Students - STEM and OPT considerations,True

It is still an important tool for engineers, the basic sciences and mathematicians. Still would not recommend it for data science, unless you expect to work in engineering and colleagues use it a lot. It is just too expensive to justify it, unless you know your employer will gladly pay for it (and all the separate toolboxes).",True

Rankings are just marketing and must be ignored, look from pros and cons from the uni and the location to avoid surprises (especially as an international), get money from wherever you can as you will have enough stress from learning, and prepare in advance to reduce that 70% to save time and enjoy the journey.",True

@khwabvachhani2100,2020-12-12T06:11:50Z,0,"Hello, I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",True

I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with. Course based masters definitely can be good, but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with, and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons.
