@vinimator,2020-05-18T04:10:24Z,0,"Hi Ken, I do recall when I couldn't find any guidance about how to initiate a DS project and what all steps needs to be carried for a complete DS project with git hub repo, your DS project from scratch proved a life saviour for me. I loved that series so much that I completed that in a single stretch. Thank you so much for making DS videos and helping us to understand the concepts behind it.  I can say that you are a North star for aspiring Data Science professional like me. Wish you to cross 10 million subscribers shortly. Thanks  Vinay",True

@Abhi-qn4xv,2020-05-14T13:34:19Z,1,"Sir i have couple of problems unrelated to this Video, I am a 3rd year engineering student from India, and planning to go ms in data science in USA after 4th year.  1.is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie, like I am seeing that some people prefer 2 years of industrial experience over 2 years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain.  2.Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether (a) . to start learning practical application of ML(like I have build a model but what next..... To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or (2) .read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college. Can u help, like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting. Thanx and sorry for such long question",True

Today I was applying to data analyst roles and I remember you saying that these are great roles for people who want to pursue data science but aren't quite there yet. I think you said that... Anyway  I was wondering if you had any tips on pursuing these roles?    And in honor of your 10,000 subscriber and 100th video, I just like to say that I took an online SQL course and somewhere I discovered your SQL Lahman's Baseball tutorial and it was great as a supplement.
