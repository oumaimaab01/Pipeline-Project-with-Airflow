@ChocolateMilkCultLeader,2022-01-12T04:32:38Z,2,Bayesian Learning will be very important. The BBN ability to operate probabilistically and work with incomplete evidence is quite powerful. It can also allow for interesting dataset quality/Imputation checks. I don't know why more people don't talk about this,True
@kelline1979,2021-12-08T02:33:59Z,1,Found it. your great content on ML-Ops. Thanks,True
@ANANDKUMAR-sd3is,2021-11-17T14:51:32Z,1,"Hii Ken,  I am also trying to switch career to data science field. Just had one question. How much programming is required?? Are data structures like trees and their algorithms also important?",True
@farhanislam8463,2021-11-11T18:32:39Z,2,"Thanks for sharing. It seems like one of those areas which you don't really get the hang of unless you're in the industry, simply because companies have that infrastructure built.",True

@EK-fs5ms,2021-10-26T20:08:13Z,1,"Hi Ken, I am planning to change Career to be a Data Scientist  Although I started the Google Analytics professional certification and I plan to then do a course in Python for Data science after. I am realising it may not be the right step to take and maybe a water of time  Do you think it may be useful and I should complete the course or do I just dive into a Data science course instead.",True
@DataProfessor,2021-10-25T04:40:22Z,1,Great and concise video Ken on MLop! Is that a Papaya T-shirt? At first thought the black circles were scattered data points but the hint at 5:36 suggested they‚Äôre black seeds of the Papaya?,True

@fratzlol,2021-10-23T07:24:57Z,1,"Thanks for the video !  I understand the importance of MLOps as a concept, but I don't understand why it has become a job.  I feel like MLOps principles should be carried out by data scientists that understand business and project managers that understand data science ; there is no need for a separate position.",True
@shrutijain1628,2021-10-23T04:44:19Z,2,Ml ops was something that I didn't  understand but now I do üíØ. I know what video to send someone if you want to know meaning of Mlops or devops. Thank you Ken!!!!,True
