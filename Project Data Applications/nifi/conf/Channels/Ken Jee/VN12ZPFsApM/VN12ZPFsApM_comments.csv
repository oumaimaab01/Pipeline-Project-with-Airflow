@KenJee_ds,2021-03-29T19:38:08Z,4,"Thanks for watching everyone! If you're looking for specific resources to learn from, there are plenty of great free and paid ones.  Some free ones I like: https://www.freecodecamp.org/ https://www.learnpython.org/ Paid one I like: 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY  - Course taught by YouTuber ""Python Programmer"" is really solid. Also have access to the other data science courses!",True

@YuzuruA,2022-01-03T20:09:15Z,1,"Yes, it is such a big downer to know statistics but to don´t be able to do a fing simple thing because absolutely nothing works and you can take 3 hours surfing from one topic to another on stackoverflow because you can´t even ch ange the color of a table.

@maxh8655,2021-11-19T02:50:05Z,0,"Hi Ken, I'm currently doing a structural biology PhD. The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting.  I've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming.  Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)?  That was long winded, but thanks!",True

@bolaowoade,2020-05-26T11:13:43Z,6,I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development. I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R. It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language. R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data. Also you can use R and Python together.,True
