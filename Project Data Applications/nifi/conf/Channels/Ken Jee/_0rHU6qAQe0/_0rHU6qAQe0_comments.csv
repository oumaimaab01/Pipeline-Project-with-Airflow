@rickymort135,2021-05-17T16:12:07Z,1,"I'm familiar with git from a software development side.  My question is for data science what do you add/track in your epo?  Do you track the entire working tree so that output files dont need to be regenerated for each contributors (e.g. if you have slow running scripts). It do you only ""add"" the source data and scripts so that each person needs to run everything in their local copies?",True

I am working on my own GitHub repository and I am at the moment working on Data Science projects thanks to your encouragement of #66daysofdata! I shall be completing Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence in a few months and I will be sharing them on GitHub as well. I wanted to thank you for your well-tailored, descriptive, and concise yet enriching videos as they are of incredible help and I use them as a road map to becoming a Data Scientist. With your guidance, I hope I end up getting a great job in the USA or Canada, and what I love more about is that you have been so interactive all along! Thank you once again Ken! <3",True

@rayojel3918,2020-10-24T12:45:53Z,2,"Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work:  1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didn’t do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice. 2. He’s using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that’s the command line interface to use git. It’s also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu it’s be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you don’t want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash).  3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first.  (Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later).",True

@huntermitchell3252,2020-10-23T18:26:25Z,1,great vid! I watched the MIT Git intro lesson about a month ago and it definitely overcomplicated things. I like how this sticks to what commands you are actually going to use,True
