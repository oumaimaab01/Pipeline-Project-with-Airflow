@scottpetrovic,2021-12-29T15:05:19Z,1,"I have been reading a lot about investments and budgeting for the past couple years. A book that really made an impact on me is ""The Millionaire Next Door"" by Thomas Stanley. One of the most important concepts that stuck with me is understanding and balancing your offense and defense with money. ""Offense"" means controlling how much money you make - which you often have less control over. And ""defense"", which is how you spend money which is more controllable. It is pretty data heavy...which you might like as a data scientist.",True

@rubyherring,2021-11-16T22:56:23Z,9,"Hey Ken, read ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" if you haven't yet. It's about how we constantly make bad/wrong decisions without noticing it, and what psychological mechanisms are behind it. These mechanisms are so fundamental to our thinking that even if you are aware of them, you still are prone to making those thinking errors. It's basically more than half a century of Kahnemann's own research distilled into one concise and very densely written book and probably the best book of the 21st century to date.",True

@scottdouglass2,2021-11-14T17:55:21Z,1,"Have you read How Not to Die? That's the book that has had the most profound impact on my life.  You talked about how our gut microbiomes affects the way that we respond to individual foods, but you didn't mention the way that what we eat impacts our gut microbiome. Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn't surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I'm extremely skeptical that it's actively good for anyone.  I'll be interested to read what they say in Personalized Diet, but I doubt they can convince me that ice cream is healthy for anyone.",True

@krispudzian,2021-11-13T10:23:32Z,1,"Hi Ken, are there any books on the topic that you found useless despite being often recommended?  Here's my small list:  1. How will you measure your life? By Clayton Christiansen  2. Never split the difference by Chris Voss who is the former FBI negotiator  3. You are a badass by Jen Sincero - a very powerful self-help book  4. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel - so far my favourite book about financial literacy",True
@jakobtimmermann8075,2021-11-13T08:59:32Z,1,"While in general on par with most, I always wonder why people are so sure about what a ""good"" habit is. So in general I think everyone should be make sure about that before jumping to conclusion on how to achieve these ""good"" habits as efficient and fast as possible. Just an example: is efficiency something that is always better than inefficiency. That's why I highly recommend something like: Henry Miller - Colossus of Maroussi Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morality Beauvoir - The Mandarins  etc. Made me wonder whether optimization is the holy grail :)",True
@josewilhelm2717,2021-11-13T08:09:51Z,1,"It's good to see you uploaded this video! I'm always looking for great book recommendations on the topic. I'm going to add Digital Minimalism, Breathing, and Why We Sleep to my next reads list! I've read Atomic habits and it's indeed a great book.  I've read a few personal development books, as I'm fascinated with the topic and always looking to increase my productivity and personal character. The first book I've read on the topic that got me started with everything else is ""7 habits of highly effective people."" That book did the same for me as Atomic habits did for you. I recommend it, it's a very interesting read.  Btw, I'm halfway of reading Getting Things Done. It's a great book, and it has added immediate value to my life already. I recommend it, too.",True

@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2021-11-12T13:43:34Z,2,"Almost forgot: I do have a suggestion of a book in english: It's ""the bullet journal method""  by Ryder Caroll. Most sites who talk about bullet journaling have actually no idea what the method is truly about which is about focusing on important matters in your life and WHY they matter.   Not having something beautiful or gating people out because ""your stuff is no bullet journal"". Ie: I do mine using small binders and not a notebook and it works for me but people have told me ""this is not a bullet journal"" and yet it's still a pretty functional bullet journal.  Also, in the same vein of atomic habits, I can recommend Elasitc habits by stephen guise, he's my go to guy when it comes to habit. And this book is about having habits that adapt to the circumstances of your life. How to maintain one when things are very hard and how to maximize the benefits of a good day.",True
@sebisamuel2605,2021-11-12T13:34:03Z,3,Yoo Ken what a flex in the thumbnail!! ü§†ü§†üê¢üê¢  Loved your recommendations and have read Atomic Habits myself and am considering to read Digital Minimalism. Well here are some of my recommendations which are about life and I guess psychology:   1: *Man's search for meaning*- A must read definitely 2: *What Every body speaks* - How to read Body language 3: *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*- BF Skinner classic (an interesting read) 4: Works by *Dostoyevsky* and *Tolstoy* - you know the classics üê¢ 5: *So you have been publicly shamed*- Definitely something for the social media world. 6: *Influence: the psychology of persuasion* 7:  *As a man thinketh*    Well the list does go on but I hope this will be of some value to you üê¢üê¢üê¢,True
@daedalusdreamjournal5925,2021-11-12T13:31:37Z,2,"You might also be interested in the practice of self hypnosis. It helps clear the mind, relax the body and increase mental focus for, say, doing machine learning ;)  The problem is my main source of information on the subject is from a french guy named Benjamin Lubszynski. He has a youtube channel unfortunately in french and two books, also in french.  That being said I'll look for english sources for this as I believe it is a lovely habit from which everyone can benefit and its benefits are many :) (greater than meditation as it takes its source from the subconscious which makes it both more accessible than meditation but also much more effective).",True
