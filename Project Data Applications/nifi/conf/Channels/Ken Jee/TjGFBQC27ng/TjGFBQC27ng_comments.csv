@liudmylataranenko4751,2021-12-06T18:17:44Z,3,The ultimate Data Science goal is to solve business problems. So it goes without saying that business skills are so important!,True
@wilsonman8661,2021-10-23T12:47:33Z,2,Fully agree it's crucial to learn how the business makes money and learn how to clearly articulate how what you want to do will help the company make more of it. :D,True

@muhammadhashir7949,2021-10-21T10:36:36Z,3,Ken I have a really important question. Are Data Structures and Algorithms important for Machine Learning?,True
@anubhavgoyal3211,2021-10-21T08:17:22Z,3,Really nicely explained! Thanks for the video. ðŸ™Œ,True
@piyushzope10,2021-10-21T05:37:37Z,3,"How to talk to different people? If someone is good in this skill things can get more easier. I think, Communication is an art as it's the first step... I myself find how can I make more improvements to my communication skills while working in industry.",True
@datasciencefromzero2666,2021-10-20T20:17:54Z,3,"Communication, man. It is very underestimated. Most of the time, we can achieve much more if we collaborate with others. On the other hand, it requires one to have strong communication skills to manage such a collaborative organization. Unfortunately, people opt out collaborating because they fail to communicate. I am not talking about just talking to each other. I am talking about ""understanding each other"" and willing to solve problems together. 2 years ago, before my PhD oral exam, one wise professor in my PhD committee told me to relax and enjoy the process because no PhD student can be smarter than 5 professors testing you. That was a great advice, and it is very true that we are stronger together IF we can communicate to be a coherent group.   With that said, I am wondering if there is a video about different ""data"" related roles. I am looking for internships. There are different roles, such as data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, AI engineer, etc... I have a broad idea how they differentiate, but I would like to learn more about these roles and their requirements. I quickly skimmed your videos, Ken, but couldn't find a video about it. I mean a video including all these roles, not just comparing data analyst and data scientist. If there is one, can you point me it? If not, it would be great to see a video about that.  You are doing great work popularizing the field and making data science accessible to more people, Ken.  Thank you! =)",True
@candidlyvivian,2021-10-20T10:30:57Z,3,Great video Ken! Completely agree with the points you raised - these are so underrated!,True

@bc4198,2021-10-18T21:02:26Z,2,"Ehhh, we can always improve, but I wouldn't take that much blame.  If you are trying to help them and they'll only give you one word answers, they're just being jerks.",True

@damianrudling7663,2021-10-18T19:18:17Z,9,"I think business strategy is important for data scientists, and then learning to deal with ambiguity. Business majors are great at dealing with ambiguity where as technical people such as engineers, data scientists etc struggle with a lot. By ambiguity, I mean that in business, 1 + 1 does not equal 2... it could equal 3 or 5 or -2.",True
