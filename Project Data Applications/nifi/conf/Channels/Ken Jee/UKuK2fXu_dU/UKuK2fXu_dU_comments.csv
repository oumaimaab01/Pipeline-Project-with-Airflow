@brendali5803,2020-10-15T06:28:41Z,1,"This video made me more aware of the importance of building my personal brand. My weekly sharing at maimai (local social medium like linkedin in China has lasted 5 months. I did not realized it has been so long until today. Just keep it as a habit.  I've worked in the manufacturing industry for over 10 years. I strongly believe that AI and big data analysis will bring our industry to a brighter future. Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills, I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry. That's why I started my sharing of AI, big data analysis, the driven power behind IT industry, 5G, block chain. The highest number of views are 100~200, still far away from those popular posts which got thousands of views. I'm not discouraged because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. So I will keep making my efforts.",True
