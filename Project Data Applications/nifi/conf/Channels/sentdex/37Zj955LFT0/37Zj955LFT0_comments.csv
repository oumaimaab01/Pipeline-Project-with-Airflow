@robertoguerra5375,2024-03-22T09:55:38Z,0,"Thank you for your plotly animation demos :)  I tried this example, but I needed this correction:  There is no Event in dash anymore, and we must use [Input('graph-update', 'n_intervals')]) in the function decorator  Also, I tried reducing the interval to 100, like you did in example 5, but the browser is very slow in displaying the updated plots. I see the dash process receiving the Input and creating the output 10 times per second. But the browser only updates 2 times per second (or so).
