A flattened image is simply contiguous memory (let's not forget that under all the Python here we have C++ and CUDA) mapped to a 1D array, which boost operations performed on the memory (lookup, writing etc.) as well as prevents memory fragmentation. What I would prefer is not an explanation where that number comes from but maybe just automatically do the flattening all together. Then again it really depends on you input. A 2D image is easy to flatten but if we go multidimensional data samples things get difficult rather quickly.",True

There is a summing of signals in the neurons and yes there is a threshold for most neurons to fire, but this is mostly the case and not always the case. Also, it is very likely that quantum coherence in the brain, a theory by Hameroff and Penrose, suggests that the brain is performing exponentially more quantum operations than previously considered. This will become more apparent as we transition to EUV resolution neuromorphic computer architectures and we will see that even if a perfect unsupervised general intelligence the AI doesn't meet our high expectations for it.

@martinmartin6300,2020-04-03T18:05:41Z,0,I realize that this is an introduction but still I think its better to obtain input size from the data itself in some way in your code. You could for example specify the input size as a must have parameter in your initializer of your class. Same for the number of neurons per layer if your fully connected layers have equal sizes. Another improvement would be to use a list of layers so that you can iterate over your layers in e.g. forward method. You could include another parameter in init which is the number of layers to use.,True

@MrCam143,2019-09-26T11:50:34Z,0,"Question regarding the branching of layers you mentioned at the end. Using the grand theft auto AI as an example,  does it make sense to think about it as the first few layers determine which specific branch to fork off into? So first few layers determine if its driving a car, and then something like if drivingCar == True: etc etc.   Is that the right way to think about it?",True

@adamgrygielski1201,2019-09-25T17:12:26Z,122,"I think you meant to use softmax algorithm instead of log_softmax :) Difference is that log_softmax is basically log(softmax(x)) and does not sum to 1 as we can see on the data you passed through. Anyway, thanks for videos, I've always wanted to see how PyTorch looks like but never had time or motivation and now I just chill watching your tutorials. Best luck!",True
