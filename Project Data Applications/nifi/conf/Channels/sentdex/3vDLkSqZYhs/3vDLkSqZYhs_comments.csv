@porlando12,2017-01-04T00:05:53Z,0,"sentdex,  I think the issue you're having with the simple bettor is that you're still allowing him to place a wager despite having negative funds. You only fixed this problem for the doubler in your previous video. I tried adding the following below the ""RollDice():"" function within the simple bettor while loop:  if (value - wager) <= 0:                 wager = value   Great tutorial by the way!",True

@maksimbanin,2014-03-29T11:03:14Z,0,"Wow, this is counterintuitve (you might have a bug somewhere). You're basically simulating roulette with 51 sectors for the casino and 49 sectors for a player. That means that on average everyone slowly loses 0.02*avg_bet*bets of their money. Why would doubler better be any good? Since the roulette have no internal state, this is exactly the same as a guy who bets 100*2^n with probability 2^(-n).",True
