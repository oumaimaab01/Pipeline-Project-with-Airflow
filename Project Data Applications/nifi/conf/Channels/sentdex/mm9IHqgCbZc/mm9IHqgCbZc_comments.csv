@milliamp,2024-02-09T03:37:54Z,1,"I agree with the person below that said to use a fiber connection for this. Get a switch that supports pluggable (SFP+) modules ($200), and buy some 10G SPF+ ($130/each) + fiber, plastic corrugated plastic pipe to put the fiber in etc. and just drop it in a trench between buildings. It's a little expensive as home networking goes but you will have reliable 10G ethernet between buildings when you are done and you can always swap/upgrade components on the other side of the fiber in the future without needing to touch the fiber for 20+ years. The 10G ethernet connections between buildings will support AP's in each building running the fastest WiFi speeds. Don't mess with mesh WiFi, media converters, repeaters etc. Just go fiber now. Even Ubiquity sells an 8 port SPF+ 10G switch for $270 if you want to stick with their ecosystem for everything.",True

@benilev6511,2024-02-08T07:59:01Z,0,"A network bridge is a (mostly)logical  term. it enables attaching 2 different MAC layer network into a single MAC layer network. For example, when you arping a device in a bridged network, you should get an answer. Point-to-point is a meaning of Physical connection, hence being in the physical layer. So, you can establish a bridge over a point-to-point connection, or over any other means of physical connection. On the other hand, you can connect 2 devices using PTP, but use IP routing, and then you get 2 separate MAC networks that communicate at the IP level",True

The page is a little dated but most of the basics haven't changed; only prices have gone down on fiber stuff.",True
@caseymorean83,2024-02-08T01:44:31Z,11,"With due respect, I think you stopped on fiber too soon.  You can get 200m outdoor rated LC to LC fiber for $200.  Many small routers and network appliances are coming out with SFP+ cages and you can pack a bunch of utility on them. Pihole, firewall, NAS, cache, etc.  There is the added benefit of hard wiring stuff in your barn.  Youâ€™d just need SFP+ connectors on routers with a 200m weather rated cable and 1000BASE-SX SFP connectors.  Try it out!  Weâ€™d love to see it.",True

@RandomGreymane,2024-02-08T00:25:21Z,0,Granted itâ€™s a much smaller distance but Iâ€™m using a Unifi AC Pro to bridge to my garage.  But if I had to do it DIY point-to-point Iâ€™d probably try and do a connection using a DIRECTV dish with standard WiFi antennas in the LNB housing.  Connect that to a mesh bridge router and point it at your home WiFi. But honestly itâ€™s almost easier to buy a couple solar LifePo4 setups and buck converters and put a switch in the middle of a physical line. To each their own.,True
@DavidGetchel,2024-02-07T23:26:17Z,1,"Nice setup. We have Starlink too along with a few of their gen 3 routers to extend into the garage and pump house. Also 4 separate solar systems. If the electronics ran on a 12/24v system you wouldn't need an inverter. That'd save money. Leftover house install panels can be found for pretty cheap. Battery is dependent on what you're trying to run and for how long, but building a pack with 18650s or something could be an option.",True

Fiber is easy, I'd run OM3 (LC-LC) fiber to a 10GB SFP+ router or switch between the points and it'd be like $500-750 for full setup.   If you want to keep it wireless I'd go with MikroTik 6Ghz P2P dishes which is a directional wireless connection that sends Gb speed internet. Ubiquiti also has these super high speed wireless connections. These P2P wireless aren't wifi rather a faster data connection and work up to several miles apart with some good line of sight.",True
