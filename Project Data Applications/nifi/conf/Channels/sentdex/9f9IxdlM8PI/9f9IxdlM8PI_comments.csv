@nareshprabhu8397,2019-02-08T19:15:51Z,0,Hey I liked this series of yours a lot. When is the next video coming out?,True
@TalesCembraneliDantas,2018-06-13T17:06:30Z,0,"Hi guy, I'm brasiliam and I reach you channel by google couse i'm reading ""Developing game with pygame"", (or something like this rs, but you're one of the writers of this book), and I'm become very impressionated with what things you can do with Python. I already program before, but never in Python, I make many things in C++, Delphi (my love), and Java but I guess the Python will make what every language try before, become a default in every system. So tks for your contribution with the new Python programers.",True
@Fiifufu,2018-06-07T08:21:51Z,2,I was going through your code and I noticed this:  Should the xstd be ystd in ys = [y for y in ys if y <= y_init_avg+xstd or y >= y_init_avg-xstd],True

@easyBob100,2018-05-25T16:25:18Z,0,"IDK about the python version of opencv, but in the C++ version, using windows and drawing to them is VERY slow.  Only show what the robot sees for debugging.",True
@bastin.5854,2018-05-25T16:22:18Z,0,You might use some kind of spring between the Arm and the striker so there is always some pressure applied. Looking forward to the next episodes!,True
