@2005krishnan,2017-04-10T16:30:26Z,0,The best tutorial that I have been able to follow except for few hiccups.  I am currently stuck in candlestick part since is has been deprecated.  I have tried downloading the mpl_finance from git but that gives me problem.  Is there any way you can shed some light on this?,True
@TipsyRiver,2017-03-30T04:37:41Z,0,"if you're getting an error you due to matplotlib.finance getting removed soon, but don't know what to do(error message instructions are unclear), you should:  1) Go to https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl_finance to get the new finance module.  2) Move *mpl_finance.py*(you don't need the other files) to site packages directory, which probably is C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\matplotlib.  3) Now you can use *from matplotlib.mpl_finance import _candlestick*. Take note of the syntax change, you need the underscore before ""candlestick"" now.",True
@kennypotts7590,2017-01-12T13:34:42Z,0,"After reading the docs, it looks like the matplotlib.dates datenum is the number of days since 0001-01-01 plus 1 day for a correction. Then it seems that you're right you could then convert to unix. Still with current implementation, the only option is to hack around a bit.",True

@MrJTrahan,2016-05-28T19:16:20Z,0,Enjoying this series!   I'm searching for a way to avoid the gaps on my chart caused by the market closures on the weekends. Any ideas on how to eliminate (step over) the weekend sections from my chart's x-axis?,True

When I run the module this message pops up:  Warning (from warnings module):   File ""C:\Users\gthomp16\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\finance.py"", line 865     mplDeprecation) MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: This function has been deprecated in 1.4 in favor of `candlestick_ochl`, which maintains the original argument order, or `candlestick_ohlc`, which uses the open-high-low-close order. This function will be removed in 1.5  No idea what this means. I'm thinking it is because I'm using anaconda.   - Thanks man keep up the good work!",True
@aliakseiharbuz9917,2014-10-30T17:39:56Z,0,Hi. How I can make candlestick from intra-day stock data. I always have  mistake 'unconverted data remains',True
@bironel7528,2014-08-17T20:52:40Z,0,"Looks like you can use something like this to get the candle array: rowmaker = lambda row: (mdates.date2num(row[0]), row[1][0], \                         row[1][3], row[1][1], \                         row[1][2], row[1][4]) candle_array = [rowmaker(row) for row in df.iterrows()]  Where df.columns = Index([u'Open', u'High', u'Low', u'Close', u'Volume', u'Adj Close'], dtype='object')  iterows gives rows as a tuple; row[0] is index (here date as timestamp) , row[1] is a tuple containing the row values in same order as df.columns.  So currently bit of a PIA to use with dataframes - but doable (with a bit of help from your tutorial)!",True
