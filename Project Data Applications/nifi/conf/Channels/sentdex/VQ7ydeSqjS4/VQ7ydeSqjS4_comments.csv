@otacon1024,2019-10-16T15:27:38Z,0,"Here because I for some reason decided to run a website that archives and provides an API for full historical WoW auction house snapshots across all regions. Realized I probably bit off more than I could chew when I gathered some data for sampling and realized that storing it as received would generate about 1.6 TB of data monthly xD Simply restructuring the data got me to about 10% of that. Pushing the result through 7zip on Ultra nets me 20% of _that_ , so I'm left with something that's 2% the original size, which is pretty impressive. Will be pretty interesting to see how Python libraries compare to 7zip. Anyways, compression = epicly useful stuff.  UPDATE: Well, after some testing, zlib underperformed 7zip (was getting about 3.5% overall). The algorithm I used with 7zip was LZMA, so I did a bit of searching, and sure enough that also ships with Python, and got me the same 2% overall compression I had with 7zip. So check that one out if you really need to squeeze out every last byte out of that data. Documentation here: https://docs.python.org/dev/library/lzma.html",True

@mrshr3d,2014-07-30T07:54:38Z,10,"The downside to using base64 output for the compression is that you don't get quite as good a compression ratio.  To avoid using it - the file object used for writing the compressed data needs to be set to 'wb'  (binary write), and 'rb' (binary read) when decompressing.   In my testing:  my decompressed file size was ~130 KB,  base64 encoded compressed file size was ~80 KB, whereas in binary format, the compressed file size was ~60 KB.  Examples:  WRITING DATA  plainData = open(""decompressed.txt"",""r"").read() compFile = open(""compressed.txt"",""wb"") compFile.write(zlib.compress(plainData) compFile.close()  READING DATA  compressedData = open(""compressed.txt"",""rb"").read() plainData = zlib.decompress(compressedData)  Hope that helps  :)",True
@TheMalaysianInvasion,2013-12-08T18:57:50Z,0,i have a question. Do you know how to create a compressed file. For example in my class we have to get a file that has a text and get the frequency of each word and so and then compress the file. I was wondering if you could help me. i  am just so lost.,True
