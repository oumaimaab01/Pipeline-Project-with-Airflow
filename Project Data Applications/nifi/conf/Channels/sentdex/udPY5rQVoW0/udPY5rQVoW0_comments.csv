You could take a real car out on a real street and record dashcam video.  Then feed it into the AI.  The AI could generated a driving game with real life graphics.  It would be way more realistic than GTA.    You could feed in footage from a F1 world grand prix race. Or nascar video.  Or Tesla dashcam footage.  Take real world driving footage and feed it into the AI.  Then generate a hyper realistic driving game that could look just like real life.  The only limitation is the GPU power.

Edited to add:   That being said large pieces of the code would have to be filled in by hand as GAN Theft Auto has no idea about other physics such as rolling upside down if the original training didn't include rolling in all angles as well as damage.  A person reverse engineering would instantly understand that this is a car, which means it's heavy, made of metal, rolls on wheels, has suspension and so on.
