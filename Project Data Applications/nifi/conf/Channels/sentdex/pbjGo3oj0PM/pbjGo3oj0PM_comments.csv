@trench6118,2014-09-27T09:02:36Z,0,"Should I use pandas or csv module to manipulate csv files? I am not so familiar with either but I would rather learn the best one for my needs: 1) Work with large csv files (back tracked data would be 2-10g each probably, but moving forward it would just be daily updates of small files) 2) Only 'extract' certain columns 3) Hopefully find and replace certain values (like if 'City' = 106 then it is NY, for example) 4) Add a column with certain calculations (like summing 3 columns and dividing by 60, for example)  I will then import those files into Tableau data extracts for analysis. ",True
