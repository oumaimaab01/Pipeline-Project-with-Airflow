@shawndegroot761,2019-09-29T19:10:47Z,1,thank you sentdex! It took me 2 months but I have finally made it through all 26 tutorials.,True
@avidelo4968,2018-11-10T08:58:56Z,0,"I enjoyed watching your series, but why convert your dependent variable into a categorical / the use of SVM rather than keeping it continuous and predicting returns? Assuming a binary dependent variable, why not apply logistic regression to determine the probability that a stock would be a winner? Why the use of a binary variable and SVM at all rather than that predict numeric outcomes like random forests or even CART? Can SVM provide factor importance metrics? I'd love to see you reopen this series working on this data set with other predictive techniques. When I look up the SVM predictions, they seem not to have stood the test of time.",True

@timlamb182,2016-04-22T12:43:32Z,0,"Thanks so much for doing the tutorial.  There is some very good stuff here.  I especially liked the info on parsing a web page.  I've done that in java and it took many more lines. There were a couple of things I expected to be covered that were not.  (suggestions for machine learning 102) 1. Using non-numeric features.  I have access to Morningstar's Moat (Wide, Narrow, and None) and Stewardship (Exemplary,  Good, Average, Poor) ratings.  Those are in order, so can be changed to 1, 2, 3 - but what about items like industry and sector?  How are those incorporated?  2. Improving the model.  How do I know if adding or removing a feature helps?  I've used random forests in R and I can set the seed, so the random factor is constant, so when I add or remove a feature, I know the result wasn't due to the random feature of the test.  For random forests, sometimes adding a feature actually hurts the accuracy.  Can that be true for SVC?",True
@SohelKhan-tr6jr,2015-04-27T14:17:59Z,2,Thank you for the excellent tutorials. I watched all the 26 tutorials and ran the programs in my Mac. They are excellent. I will conduct experiments with other Machine Learning algorithms to compare results from different MLs.,True
@kimnorth7060,2015-04-24T13:58:53Z,1,"thanks for the tutorials, thoroughly enjoyed all 26 and picked up a few handy python tricks along the way!!",True
@slipthetrap,2015-02-01T12:09:34Z,0,"You mentioned the SEC's Edgar information a couple of times. Do you know of a python api for that ?  So far I've only found examples that either use FTP or RSS to download txt/xbrl files, which seems to work ok. Also, once one gets the edgar data which fields/features were you planning on using ? Just curious, as I started writing a small app for this, but there's a ton of info in a 10-K filing. Thanks in advance.",True
@slipthetrap,2015-01-30T20:03:02Z,2,If anyone wants the source code in these videos I just added parts 18 to 26 see: https://github.com/cleesmith/sentdex_scikit_machine_learning_tutorial_for_investing ... can't wait for more videos,True
