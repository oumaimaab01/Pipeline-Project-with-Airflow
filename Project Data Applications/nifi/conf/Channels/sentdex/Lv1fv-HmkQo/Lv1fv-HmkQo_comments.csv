I was considering switching to linode per your recommendation but noticed since it is a virtual private server, you need to setup and manage your own email server.  Linode has a guide (https://linode.com/docs/email/running-a-mail-server/) which reading between the lines discourages their customers from doing so.  How do you handle email?
