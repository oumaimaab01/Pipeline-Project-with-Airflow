@mikelezhnin8601,2018-07-06T23:05:05Z,1,"@sentdex So, first of all, those pictures you generated by yourself sure look like those from the DeepMind, I wonder why you decided to make those by hand.  Second, coming from an SC2 player here: if you just go voidrays and optimize your strategy, you will indeed  get fairly good at the game, but you will hit a ceiling. The reason is, in SC2 there is a thing called build-order, which is kind of your strategy for your early game. SC2 is a lot like rock-paper-scissors, where some openers beat the others -- just because.  You already probably noticed that your strategy kind of struggles versus early rushes. So I highly suggest to somehow program in the ability to chose a build order or something of that sort.  There are some more things to SC2:   First: warpgates and chronoboost. Warpgates tech is researched at the cybercore and allows you to turn your gates into warpgates, so that they ill warp and rechange faster, and also can warp anywhere in the psionic matrix. Chronoboost is an ability of the nexus, it speeds up the production of the building that you cast chronoboost on. Those two things are like really important for protoss.  Second: scouting -- the way to beat the opponent at rock-paper-scissors is to scout and predict what he will chose, you know :)  Third one is called harassment, especially early game harassment -- that is to deal damage with small amount of units without engaging into a battle. Create two adepts  and send them right into the enemy base, best case scenario use shade (adepts ability) to get behind the mineral line and start killing workers. If you will implement build-orders I think it will learn to do the harassment on its own, otherwise I do recommend adding those two adepts at the start of the game. Alternatively you can get an oracle out of your first starport, that one also can kill most of workers with no problems.  Last but not least, upgrades. So, there is the cybercore for air units, you can get +1 attack and later maybe +1 armor for your voidrays there, and there is forge, which lets you research upgrades for ground units. Get yourself +1 attack, it profits stalkers a lot.",True

So you flipped the co-ordinates for the map while creating the numpy array but you used the co-ordinates of the nexuses in the same order as provided by python-sc2. Wouldn't you eventually encounter an out of bounds error because of messing with the dimensions of numpy array? Thanks :),True
