@ispete,2015-03-11T18:56:13Z,2,"I'm a bit confused with some pieces of code.  Under class SeaofBTCapp:  frame = StartPage(container, self)  What is the meaning of 'self' here?  Does it have to do with the 'controller' argument in the initialization under 'class StartPage'?  If i remove the 'self' parameter from above and the 'controller' parameter from the code under 'class StartPage' It runs just fine like so:  frame = StartPage(container) ... ... class StartPage(tk.Frame):    def __init__(self,parent):  Great tutorials!  Thank you for your hard work!",True
