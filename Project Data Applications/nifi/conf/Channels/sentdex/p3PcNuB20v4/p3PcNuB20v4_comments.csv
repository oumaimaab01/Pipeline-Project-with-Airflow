@HrvojeSpoljar,2016-10-26T15:50:34Z,0,drop_caches is bad; stuff you are purging from there will need to be read again from disk and will cause your disk to become bottleneck sooner rather than later. I urge you to revisit this video and reconsider this strategy. If you have issues tuning your system let me know I can help you tune it so you don't need to do this truly horrible thing which will honestly not bring you any good.,True

@mulchi01,2015-04-06T17:46:34Z,8,"One little correction. In your own example file you have  * */5 * * *  as an example for ""every five hours."" Well, that's slightly wrong.  That minute * is actually quite a tricky one. What you have is ""run every minute every hour divisible by 5"". So it will run every minute in the hour 5, 10, 15 and 20, or 240 times a day. With scripts that run longer than a minute, that could actually create all sorts of problems.  What you want is  0 */5 * * *  Instead of the leading 0 you can of course state any minute you want, but this will run it only on the ""0""-th minute every 5 hours, or only 4 times a day.",True
