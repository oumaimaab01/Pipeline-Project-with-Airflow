I have a question and I am not  sure where to go to: I am using NLP to analyze language and match it to specific graphics.  Users would enter text and then the text would display graphics according to both the actual word and syntax.  I am creating my own algorhythms that match the verbal content to a specific graphics-animation algo, which would be executed through javascript.    I am essentially creating my own language classification that is related to visual elements. I am a relative beginner and my question is essentially how does one structure the architecture so that the nltk will be able to analyze the user text input, return variable to which it belongs. and then go into the javascript to connect with the graphics algo,( because the linguistic classification will determine the order of the graphics display)  I was starting with NLTK and Python but then ended up using a simple library for now (NLP compromise) because I am not doing statistical analysis as of yet, I just want to be able to start connecting works and expressions to the graphics, which is easier with JS at this early stage since I am using the browser to display everything.
