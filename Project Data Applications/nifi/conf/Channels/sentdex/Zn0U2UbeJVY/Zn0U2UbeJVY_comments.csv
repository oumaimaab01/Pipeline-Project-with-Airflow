@jefflee5113,2018-04-23T00:24:42Z,0,"This is a great video, I wanted to thank you and ask you a question.  I am interested is it possible to take a picture of multiple objects and have it display the outline or silhouette of the items to the proper scale?  I only need it in black and white, but am trying to figure out how to understand what the distortion and or parallax will be.  I would think there is a method to ensure the proper scale of all items taking a photo and just getting the outline.  If there is I would love to hear your thoughts.",True
