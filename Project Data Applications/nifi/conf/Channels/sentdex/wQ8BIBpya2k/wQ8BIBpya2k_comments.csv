Otherwise, we may get troubles if a compact network structure is used for training. So you may want to consider x_train /= 255.0 instead. (Please ignore my comment if I was wrong:))",True

I have a problem tho when I run your code with my own sample pictures instead of the MNIST data set. It took me quite a while to figure out how to format the data so it will be accepted by keras, but finally I did and startet training. I tried several different setups, like expanding the dense layers to 1024 nodes, adding more layers, taking away some, chose different set ups for optimizing / loss calculation.  But somehow, no matter what I try, it will have some accuracy right from the beginning say, 40%, 50% or 60%, and that will be the end result. While learning it actually drops down a few percents, but overall it will stay around the same value that it has from the beginning.  Is that a sign that my data is crap, the topology is wrong for what I want to learn, my sample number is too low or too high, or what could I do wrong to get that kind of result?

@kwea123,2018-08-11T14:46:10Z,28,"You shouldn't normalize the test data with respect to its own mean and std, as it is not supposed to be known in advance. The correct way to do is to normalize with the mean and the std of the training set.  At 14:26 binary crossentropy is totally not what you explained in the video... it's not because there are two classes (cats or dogs) that you use ""binary"" crossentropy as it might sound. Binary crossentropy works no matter how many classes you have, and the difference between it and categorical crossentropy is that in the former case the classes are not mutually exclusive, e.g. there could be a dog and a cat in the image at the same time, and the output probabilities are independent for each class, so you can have .99 dog and .98 cat; In contrast, the latter, categorical crossentropy, means that the classes are mutually exclusive, e.g. there can be only one kind of animal in an image, so for example .79 dog and .21 cat. In mnist we use categorical crossentropy not because there are more than two classes but because there is only one kind of digit in one image.",True
