@nacnud_,2020-02-16T12:23:19Z,0,"First: Test the parameter at the top, if it's that important to you. Why measure, if you can't return a value?  Second: Why setup the GPIO in this function? GPIOs don't tend to change. So, get them setup once, not every time you use the distance function.   Third: Don't use magic numbers, ever. Even if you define PIN_DRIVE_SOUND_SENSOR = 12. Number the other ones too.  Thanks for the sensor usage stuff. Very good.",True

@bluerayyy6193,2017-11-23T22:21:38Z,0,"hi guys, so i tried all of what he's done except i used a voltage divider with two resistors. anyway i tried this code with my sensor and it didn't work as if it got no signal back it didn't send another out so just a suggestion if you have a similar problem i created a counter and used an if statement increasing the counter in the no signal while so after a certain amount of runs it would set pin 12 to false then true sending out another signal. before i did this it only rarely worked or i had to use the wires to get it to work by plugging or unplugging certain wires but now it works fine",True

@mustakimmustakim,2017-05-05T08:47:42Z,0,"Hi sir, I try your coding from your website. But it didnt working. When I run it, the distance always show 100. I try different sensors and it is still the same. What would probably going wrong?",True
@gabrielgermani8444,2017-04-27T11:18:19Z,0,excuse me but i don't understand how you put tl/0.000058 = distance but we both know that speed = 2distance(forth and back)/time so 2d= time*speed and speed = 340 m.s-1 so 2d = 340*time so d = 170*time so i don't really see where you got with 0.000058 and 0.000148,True

@tigersteelers,2016-03-17T22:01:15Z,0,"This is easily one of the worst playlist/tutorial setups I have ever seen. You make an intro video with ""all"" the part required for this project, but then proceed to keep adding additional parts throughout the playlist. I have ran back and forth between multiple stores looking for these required parts which you stated would be in the kit from sainsmart in your first video of the playlist titled, ""supplies needed."" Thanks for informing me, someone new and interested in programming, on ALL the supplies necessary for this project to be completed. I have now lost the interest in programming that I once had due to the lack of information that was provided through this playlist.
