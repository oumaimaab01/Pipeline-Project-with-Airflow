@luismatias2495,2020-07-21T22:12:45Z,1,Just a note for next viewers: You can use ['center_y': 0.5 ] or ['center_x': 0.5] inside [pos_hint] to center (exactly) buttons on window. Thanks for video :),True

@brpawankumariyengar4227,2019-02-23T07:14:41Z,0,My Python App does not seem to be picking up my .kv files (though) they are in the same directory. Is there any naming conviction that I need to follow? Please let me know. I had to (in frustration) use float layout by directly specifying in Python code. Please help me,True
@TheJaniable,2019-01-30T19:48:44Z,1,I wonder why you're using IDLE everywhere. Is it a personal preference or you just want to keep it as simple as possible so anyone can jump right in?,True

@kowsikr7690,2018-11-01T18:30:57Z,0,Does the buttons created can be deserved to hold any action like submitting to databases?  And does kivy helps for Android app creation for mobile phones?,True
@red5hat,2018-07-08T06:46:59Z,0,Looking at the code in another terminal and typing won't do. It proves you are not fluent using Kivy. And making these videos out of pressure of just to make your presence felt on youtube.,True

@BleachWizz,2017-12-12T16:02:40Z,14,"QUICK EXPLANATION:  ""x""             : 0->1 goes from the LEFT to the RIGHT and it places the LEFT of the widget in place. ""center_x"": 0->1 goes from the LEFT to the RIGHT and it places the MIDDLE of the widget in place. ""right""       : 0->1 goes from the RIGHT to the LEFT and it places the RIGHT of the widget in place.  ""y""             : 0->1 goes from the BOTTOM to the TOP and it places the BOTTOM of the widget in place.

@tsalamazing4032,2017-10-17T16:30:01Z,0,is the init not needed here because the app class inherits only from the Widgets? Thank you,True
@sraheja12,2017-09-08T04:52:32Z,0,"I suppose it is in't the degree of topness or rightness, it is just the location of the top or right edge of the widget. 0 is extreme bottom or left and 1 is extreme top or right",True
@achintyatiwari7723,2017-06-27T19:27:37Z,0,"actually there are only 4 pos_hint parameters >>> x,y,top,right  (where x and y act as left and bottom)  of button",True

@Justin-oo3bh,2016-06-20T17:22:04Z,1,"After looking at the docs/source code I think the reason your ""bot"" key in the dictionary is not working, is that it doesn't exist (at least in kivy 1.9.1, not sure about the version you were using in the video). The dictionary will take any keyword you give it but not throw you an error like ""keyword 'bot' is not a valid keyword"" which is kind of misleading.   The valid keys for the dictionary are: x: How far in the x direction (from bottom left of button and screen) right: How far right (from right side of button and left of screen) y: How far in the y direction (from bottom left of button and screen) top: How far up (from bottom of screen and top of button) center_x:  How far in the x direction(from the center x point of the button and left of the screen) center_y: How far in the y direction(from the center y point of the button and bottom of the screen) center:  This one combines both center_x and center_y, however takes a list or tuple of the two values. Eg. {""center"": (0.5, 0.5)} centers the button at the center of the screen anchored at the center of the button. pos: Similar to center except it uses the bottom left of the button as the anchor (Combines x and y). This also takes a tuple  Hope this helps someone, feel free to leave a comment if I messed something up, I am new to kivy aswell.  Thanks :)",True
@MiledRizk,2016-03-12T20:29:26Z,0,"Thanks again for the tutorials, for the position hint thing, the ""right"" means the top right, not the top left, this is why if we write ""right"": 0 the widget will disappear, and the same thing goes for the ""Top"" position. Also there is no ""Bottom"" property, this is why it wasn't responding, same for the ""left"", also it doesn't exist.",True
@yomomma338,2016-03-09T04:59:22Z,1,I don't understand why you could make buttons without importing it into the python code. Can anyone explain this?,True
@RonnieAndrewMagatti,2015-09-04T03:05:17Z,2,"Just a comment, the (0, 0) isn't ""flipped"" ist just that on OpenGL left bottom corner is where the 0,0 is. Since kivy runs on OpenGL I guess it wouldn't make any sense to just shift the 0,0 to the top left corner. Thanks for the FloatLayout explanation thought, was very useful. (:",True
@ViaNocturna85,2015-06-10T10:08:51Z,0,"I think the better way to explain the 'degree of...' is to rather use 1 = on, 0 = off, like a lightswitch. That way when bottom=0 would make more sense when it starts at bottom",True
