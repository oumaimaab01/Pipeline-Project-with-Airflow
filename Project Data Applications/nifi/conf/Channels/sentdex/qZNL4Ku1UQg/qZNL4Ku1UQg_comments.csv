When I type in the IP address, the app works as desired, but if I navigate to my freshly bought domain, it shows the index.html file located in var/www/html by default. Do you know how I could fix this? Thanks in advance!",True

@foenixlord,2015-07-09T17:13:28Z,8,"Hi Harrison, first thank you so much for your tutorials, you are a great teacher.  I have a problem with (maybe) Flask, I've followed your tutorial step by step but at the end, the ubuntu apache2 default page ""it works!"" shows up instead of the __init__.py I would expect. I cannot find the solution over the internet to solve that problem. Do you have any idea why?",True

@SHABOQ,2015-04-12T16:20:20Z,0,"Hi Harrison.  Google didn't really guide me through my problem so maybe you will. From time to time when I'm trying to start/restart the apache2 service i get this error: ""apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message"". Any suggestions?  Also, great series!  Edit: The only time it doesn't give me this error is if I break the SSH connection and SSH into the server again. Then I can run service apache2 start and everthing works fine, until I try to restart it or stop it and start it.",True
