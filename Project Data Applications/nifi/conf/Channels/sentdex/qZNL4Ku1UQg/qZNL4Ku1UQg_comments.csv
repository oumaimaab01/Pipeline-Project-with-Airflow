@petrolbears,2016-01-16T20:46:00Z,0,"Hi Harrison, I set up a Flask app following your tutorials and I came to a point where I linked it to a domain I bought on GoDaddy. When I type in the IP address, the app works as desired, but if I navigate to my freshly bought domain, it shows the index.html file located in var/www/html by default. Do you know how I could fix this? Thanks in advance!",True

@foenixlord,2015-07-09T17:13:28Z,8,"Hi Harrison, first thank you so much for your tutorials, you are a great teacher.  I have a problem with (maybe) Flask, I've followed your tutorial step by step but at the end, the ubuntu apache2 default page ""it works!"" shows up instead of the __init__.py I would expect. I cannot find the solution over the internet to solve that problem. Do you have any idea why?",True

@SHABOQ,2015-04-12T16:20:20Z,0,"Hi Harrison.  Google didn't really guide me through my problem so maybe you will. From time to time when I'm trying to start/restart the apache2 service i get this error: ""apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message"". Any suggestions?  Also, great series!  Edit: The only time it doesn't give me this error is if I break the SSH connection and SSH into the server again. Then I can run service apache2 start and everthing works fine, until I try to restart it or stop it and start it.",True

@paulransfield,2015-03-27T06:53:39Z,0,"hi harrison ... i crashed my initial flask app ... to restore, i had to:  1   Add these two lines of code into the FlaskApp.wsgi file ...   activate_this = '/{{ add your path to your virtual environment here }} /bin/activate_this.py' execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))  2   Change my app.py to __init__.py  I accept that if I had followed your advice and not develop on a production server, I may not have had this issue ... however, if you want multiple tools on your production server, I think at some stage these two lines need to be added into the FlaskApp.wsgi file  Thanks very much - love your tutorials",True
