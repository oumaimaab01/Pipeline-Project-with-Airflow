@diconicabastion5790,2021-12-21T22:05:27Z,0,Doing FPS that way is the wrong way. In professional game development we use a timer not to limit the cycle rate unless you are using vsync. Vsync sucks. What you effectively did was create a vsync and turn it on. except it isn't hardware based on video refresh rates or anything. If you want all your stuff to move at the same rate on different machines us use the timer to determine how far they moved each frame. So for example if you want something to have a velocity of 60 pixels a second you time how long it was from the last cycle with your timer. If you do it in milliseconds you divide the time the last cycle took by 1000 then multiply it times the 60 so you know how far it should have moved in that time. Then you update the position to that.   It also doesn't guarantee 60 FPS or cycles. It just limits you to that being the max. So if someone is running slower hardware their entire timing is going to be off any ways. All it does is cause the system to burn up CPU cycles if it gets around to that point and 16.6 milliseconds haven't passed by.  On modern hardware you are better off creating your own timer using int(round(time.timer() * 1000000) so you can get the microseconds. clock.tick() returns in microseconds. which can be to slow for modern hardware. Using that 60 in it,True

It's a heavy and frustrating blow honestly, as I set out learning python almost a year ago now, making a ton of other programs with the end goal of writing my own games and eventually a MMORPG.  Does anyone know a way to distribute the game? I know it's possible, or nobody would be making games with python.

@gukonni,2015-01-22T21:07:57Z,0,"I can barely hear this. Why's it so quiet?  Few things I want to say.  If Python is supposed to be easy, why'd they make 3.0 not backwards compatible with 2.x? All of those tutorials online are invalid now unless they're for 3.0. And all of those libraries which could be used are incomptable as well, unless they have been ported.  And linux doesn't make this easy. There's no ""pygame"" in the software center. Apparently, to get pygame working with python 3.4 I have to build it. And building it means I have to probably use console commands. Linux is soooooooo unfriendly this way, but I guess one can't expect much more given this is a programming language, not a game.  Bottom line, just making a simple python program IS easy. Ubuntu comes prepackaged with pythong 3.4 and IDLE. This is usable for someoen who wants to use python for coursework or as a means to make some text game prototypes. But this is just hte beginning. If one wants to go further, it's a big job to pull all of these loose ends together.  I will watch these videos you made. I'm currently messing with some text game ideas. Trying to settle on the best setup for it. My background is mostly in C++, but I've used almost everything out there, including Python. I really like Python. There're just a lot of factors.",True
