@vaw7016,2019-04-16T11:00:04Z,0,"Hi, I used a automated excel or google (?) spreadsheet that scraped data from Morningstar. Recently this sheet stopped working. Only the manual excel version, where I copy/paste all data myself, still works. Searching on the internet learns me that Morningstar has changed something to avoid scraping. Do you have any solutions for this? I am not a computer/excel/spreadsheet expert, but I am really looking for a solution. Especially because many people use this sheet and they are all waiting for it to work again.   You can find a video of the working manual spreadsheet here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0RL4WyIPoo   A video about the automated spreadsheet (which stopped working) can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwN3F3QwDsc   I have contacted they guy who send me the spreadsheets and got his permission to find a solutione because he hasn't one. (he didn't develop the sheet all by himself)",True
