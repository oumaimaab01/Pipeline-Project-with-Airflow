@specom1653,2016-03-25T20:24:39Z,0,"I'm having some issues, I think its because im using windows 10? I got this set up perfect on my windows 7 work laptop. But im getting 1 line error for pandas and like 6 line errors for numpy. Ive been using python 3.5 on both. Ill try python 3.4 on my windows 10 and see what happens.  For example the pandas one says something like line 13 __import__(dependencies) it seems like some compatibility issue because i did what seemed to be the exact same thing on my laptop, i tried 32 and 64 bit as well.",True
