@flabberdog,2020-04-06T08:18:09Z,0,How come the game.loop function uses a global variable without calling it as a global variable? How does it know what display_width is equal to without calling it as an input parameter in the function definition or without calling it as a global variable. Is this an old version of python where global variables were able to be called in functions if not defined in the input arguments?  Thanks,True

@oribarashy1,2018-09-19T04:37:52Z,0,"First off, love all your videos. Better than other things I've tried online, including a Udemy course... I think I know why you have to release one key completely before moving the opposite direction (sorry if you've solved this in a later vid). If you press R then L then release R, event type will bey KEYUP and x_change == 0, hence the car stops moving.

@asrowley1,2016-06-11T09:29:08Z,3,Love the tutorials. I'm a CS teacher and I'm hoping to use these next year if that's okay? This code isn't working for me: for event in pygame.event.get():              if event.type == pygame.QUIT:                 gameExit = True I have a work around of:             if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:                 if event.key == pygame.K_x:                      gameExit = True But really want to know why the former isn't working....,True
@leisun3347,2016-05-24T11:11:16Z,0,"About the function ""def car"", I think the gameDisplay is a global variable.  Why the ""global gameDisplay "" statement is not needed?  Thank you.",True

@jivegaming9685,2016-04-05T20:31:42Z,1,"Hey, huge thanks for doing these videos first of all! Secondly, I have made a background ( to look like a road) and I wanted to have boundaries that didn't mean crashed so I put:  if x < 211:             if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:                  if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:                      x_change = 0          if x > 956:             if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:                 if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:                     x_change = 0  My dimensions are slightly different to yours but anyway - once I run it and hold the left arrow it will stop at x = 211 but then if you keep tapping the left key it will still move to the left and vice versa to the right! Can you help? Or suggest a better way to just stop them from keeping on moving?  Thanks again!",True

@redvineslicorice,2016-02-13T06:54:56Z,0,I like how short each video is :) It's way easier to watch a few ten minute videos than a half an hour video. Especially cause I can take breaks with these. Great tutorials :),True
@TheHamza300,2016-01-28T11:46:02Z,0,i did as you said. subtracted display_width from car_width but the game still exits before it touches the edge. why is it happening?,True
@KarPlaysGamez,2016-01-05T02:33:51Z,0,if x < -car_width:    x = display_width - car_width   if x > display_width:    x = 0   This code will just send them to the other side.,True
@xevelzolYT,2015-11-13T09:59:07Z,24,"Hi, this how i deal with car_width automaticly  carImg = pygame.image.load('mycar.png') (car_width,car_height) = carImg.get_rect().size",True
@renux4944,2015-11-08T03:03:51Z,53,"Thanks a lot for making these tutorials, it's really helping me out. <3",True
@miwwie1504,2015-10-02T12:39:36Z,1,"hey sentdex, you know my gameExit doesnt works, BUT! you can also use pygame.quit() synthax, and it will do the same thing instead of crashing and all that, maybe you could use it?  ANSWER PLEASE!!!",True
@azzeddinekharbach8832,2015-09-11T20:14:50Z,2,"Hi,  Can't we get the width of the image directly from the Object carImg ?? by using some method if it exist, like carImg.width() or something like that ?? Big thanks for your videos man !!!!",True

@bigal6667,2015-08-14T20:26:08Z,11,I have learned more from your videos than from 2 books that I read regarding python. please keep the videos going!!!,True
@Ahzafera,2015-05-20T21:45:18Z,0,"I was going along with this, just doing what you said without checking the video too much. Mine worked when I tested it as your didn't xD actually couldn't tell what was wrong with yours, though I guess thats because I wasn't the one scrolling through. Just found that amusing for whatever reason xD",True

@backwoodsbaker4226,2014-12-24T23:12:02Z,0,never mind i figured it out. i had one Exit and the other EXIT. they have to be the same,True

@SwayyAllTheWayy,2014-11-08T11:58:36Z,0,is there  a way to make a custom background in this game?,True
@greenalien5509,2014-10-29T22:17:35Z,9,I did mine a little differently...   key_right = False  key_left = False  while not gameExit:      for event in pygame.event.get():    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:     gameExit = True         if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:     if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:      key_left = True     elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:      key_right = True          if event.type == pygame.KEYUP:     if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:      key_left = False     if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:      key_right = False         if key_left == True and x > 0:    x += -5   if key_right == True and x < (display_width - 128):    x += 5  This way the car stops at the borders and holding both keys down at the same time works properly. :),True
@ladyqonimvu8604,2014-10-06T13:00:37Z,0,there is an error in coding .. of keys .. heres the way for event in pygame.event.get():               if event.type == QUIT:                      pygame.quit()                      sys.exit()               if event.type == KEYDOWN:                      if event.key == K_RIGHT:                             x_change =  5                      elif event.key == K_LEFT:                             x_change = -5         x = (x + x_change),True
@Klainn,2014-08-31T03:22:00Z,29,All your vids are so well done. Keep up the good work. I feel I'm actually understanding what I'm seeing with these tutorials. ,True
