@jasonwhyttes1679,2019-02-02T15:50:36Z,1,"my guess for why the pump starts before the arm gets back is that its calculating how long it would take to get to a position and then continuing with the next command, perhaps 1000000 is faster than the arm can move, so it defults to its max speed somewhere under 1000000, but still calculates and runs the code as if it did move that fast.",True

@wuda-io,2018-05-22T21:35:35Z,0,I guess it measures the current of the pump motor. So it has feedback of the torque of the motor and knows therefore the pressure. This is also the case in window openers in the car to dont injure your arm/hand.,True

@kylek29,2018-05-22T18:31:54Z,0,"This should be a fun series!  Looking over the API code, the wait=True (it's also on the pump code, so it can be set to wait) has an internal timeout, it appears to wait for the msg_id to be processed or the timeout limit. So that's why it doesn't always wait.  Within the protocol.py, there's a ton of config. Including the cmd GCodes.   As for the gripper, it uses a current feedback loop. Essentially, if the grip has something, the current ADC read should change (pump drawing more current as it's working harder).  For the more curious:  getPumpStatus() is in uArmAPI.cpp under the Marlin firmware.   Threshold is set under the Arduino library: uArmApi.cpp PUMP_GRABBING_CURRENT = 55",True
