@vivianyang3130,2017-07-26T23:20:48Z,0,"Hey, I have a question about this algorithm. Is this algorithm runs at the end of the day to decide whether buy or sell? How can I specify whether my algorithm runs at the beginning of the day or the end of the day? If I choose the backtest as daily, does that means you only exercise one time each day(maybe the end of the day) to check if it meets your condition even if it crosses over several times during the daytime?",True
@adamdry9423,2017-07-06T09:40:16Z,0,"Thanks for the vids! Can you explain the difference between a python method and a function in the terminology of php, .NET or java? Is a method basically a static function? Cheers",True

@tomasemilio,2016-07-07T17:10:31Z,0,"I really like these videos, although I would not recommend it to someone with no Python coding experience.  They really need to learn the basics before really taking advantage of these videos. Anyhow, great videos man.",True
@mspacey,2016-06-30T20:06:24Z,0,Hi I'm trying to replicate what you're doing here but Quantopian doesnt have the Daily/Minute option.  It seems to be running by the minute Minute by default and taking forever.  do you know how to set it back to daily?  thanks,True
@2371996npistiolas,2016-06-28T02:16:19Z,0,i would like to know if the libraries available in quantopian are downloadable. can you use them in your own algorithm and if not are there any libraries on the internet about trading?,True
@vinshah292,2016-06-16T00:00:09Z,12,"Hey so this was posted roughly a year ago and I was wondering if it will still be applied today? I went to new algorithm and it had a lot more different ""methods"" to it. Looking at them it doesn't seem to complicated, but I was wondering if you had maybe a video or a link that would explain it better. Thank you for these videos though very helpful.",True

@herkfsu,2015-12-02T03:42:51Z,0,"Thanks Sentdex!  When you are establishing variables(MA1, current_price etc) what is the difference when you are using brackets to call upon something vs parenthesis vs periods?  For example, why would context[portfolio.positions.symbol.spy].amount not work? What is going on when using each different callout(not sure what the right word is for those)?  Thanks!",True
@cedrickojo,2015-11-04T03:28:44Z,0,"Thanks for the video! A few questions: 1. In the initialize method,  will you ever pass in more arguments than ""context""? 2. What does it mean when you continue referencing ""context"", are you calling a specific input?",True
