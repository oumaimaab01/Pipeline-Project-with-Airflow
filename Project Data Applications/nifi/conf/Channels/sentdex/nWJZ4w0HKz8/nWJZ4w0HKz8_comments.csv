The game most probably mange inputs by polling them every frame, pressing/releasing instantaneously will results in most of the key presses not being detected by the game. Sleeping is very crude and blocks the rest of your code which is pretty bad. Have you tried just keeping the key pressed until the next loop iteration?

@Alluvian567,2017-08-03T21:56:21Z,0,"I know this is late, but I think a serious problem here is that with keyboard you are teaching it very bad habits.  When you turn on keyboard in a game like this you feather the key, so some frames on a turn you have it held down, and on other frames you have your finger off.  Exactly what frames you are on or off the key is fairly arbitrary.  I guess it COULD learn to mimic that feather from scrambled data, but it seems unlikely.  A steering wheel or controller with analog input seems like it would be far better, and a lot more like how an actual car or bike would work.

I REALLY NEED AN ANSWER BECAUSE I WILL PLAY IT ONLINE IN FUTURE AND You can evolve this to a new level ! If you play Gta 5 online .. you need just to create a checkpoint on the map and after that  the motorcycle or car go there without your help but you just need to programe it,True

@MarkJay,2017-04-19T05:38:49Z,2,I'm not sure how to implement the PID because you need a target value to compare with prediction. we don't really have a target value. Maybe your idea of using the prediction percentage will work tho.  anyways super cool project!!,True
