@dustmouse,2015-04-02T17:38:49Z,13,"I have a pet python.  I have studied them for a long time.  They are wonderful creatures and I don't think it's cool that you're making flasks out of them.  Also, I hope you're drinking root beer out of that flask, because alcohol is for Losers (notice how the L is capitalized?  That's because it's Loser with a capital L).  Anyway, I just noticed a video called something Django, and I'm going to go tell people not to watch that crumb pile of a movie.    ",True

@alexmm01,2015-02-02T07:29:13Z,0,"I like Flask and Python in general but the reason I still use php most of the time is ease of hosting.

@themolynator5127,2015-01-02T08:01:11Z,0,"hey ill keep this short.  so i want to launch a website, which will be mainly an informational blog site with articles, images, and links to other sites.  I figured I should use wordpress because its easy and cheap.  Its my first site, Ive already got 6 basic html pages laid out, but need to doctor them up to look pretty and write articles.  Id kind of like to make it look slick with html5 and css3, nothing crazy just more of a well rounded look, maybe embed some videos, rather than boring old html.  I take it Id still need to find a web hosting server correct? and would I need to use flask for this?  Im planning on keeping it fairly simple as my first site, though may add an email newsletter script.  Thanks",True

@sentdex,2014-10-11T15:45:05Z,28,"Apollo Clark Only a matter of time before someone has a bone to pick with what I said there. I don't want to turn this comment section into an argument about *what* php is, or *what* Wordpress is. There is no definitive, authoritative, answer, as these are just categories that we're imposing on things after-the-fact that aren't built to purposefully fit into categories for people.  Most people also put their foot down and say WordPress isn't a framework, and cite that it is a CMS. For whatever odd reason, people refuse to think of things as a spectrum, it must be ""this"" or ""that.""  Soon someone will probably come in here and argue with me about the ""level"" I called C as well.",True
@apolloclark,2014-10-11T14:54:13Z,3,"PHP is a programming language, not a framework. Laravel, Zend Framework, and Yii, are PHP frameworks. Wordpress is a Content Management System, which includes a framework. The biggest issues with large frameworks are architectural lock-in, and performance; ie, if I want a RESTful API, the framework needs to support it, or be flexible enough to add support to it, which Flask does very nicely.",True
@Colstonewall,2014-09-24T23:23:47Z,0,"I'm glad you're tackling Flask. Question, how deep are you going? Are you going to make a couple simple pages and stop, or make a real site?  I've read most of Miguel Grindberg's book on Flask, and think it's great. However there are some things he does I really don't get. I'm not even sure why he does some of the things he does in it, but for the most part it's a great book. Of course it's a Blog example, which I HATE! Anyways, curious if you've read it?",True
