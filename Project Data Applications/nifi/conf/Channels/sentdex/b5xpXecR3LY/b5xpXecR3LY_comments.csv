@krembananowy,2017-07-12T00:27:37Z,30,"Sentdex, for the reinforcement learning the time for travel between checkpoints is the ONLY score Charles gets? If so, you are dealing with big *reward delay*. You can do something called ""reward shaping"" : add secondary factors to his reward. For example, if Charles arrives to a checkpoint he gets 1000 / time_taken points, but outside of that he always gets 0.1 * distance_traversed_along_gps + 0.01 * current_speed. Even if the secondary goals are purely heuristic (high speed is not always the best thing to achieve) it can push learning forward (or sideways) significantly. There is even a paper written by some students, where a Convnet was learning to play a couple of SNES games. On the racing game F-Zero the net failed to learn to make a single lap, because the points were given in form of time per lap, so only upon finishing the lap. Once they added forward velocity to the reward function and restarted the learning process they got good results really quickly.",True
