@gedoensful,2021-05-03T16:14:34Z,1,Don‚Äôt you have overlapping date ranges? That would be a reason why repos show up multiple times. There‚Äôs get_tags or something like that to get the tags without doing another API call. You can also easily get a tarball (tar.gz or zip) from github and extract that. Probably way quicker than potentially cloning huge repos if you‚Äôre only interested in the current code anyway‚Ä¶,True

@Cieric,2021-05-03T15:34:30Z,2,"Probably a little late considering it's been almost a month since you made the video but ranges will get you all results for both days, best to just do a single day like ""created:2021-04-10"" and next I don't know if it's it but there was a get_tags entry in that list which sounds like a function and an extra api call.
