It's really not impossible to learn the basics of python in one week, and people in bootcamps do that. But how do you recognize, that an algorithm is fast? How do you prove, that a system meets certain security standards? Programming is not taught that much, because just programming is really not that hard. In my university, we had only one pure programming class in the first semester in Java and still after one semester everyone was able to program a 2d or even 3d game.  There are dedicated programming classes for people who are more interrested in just web programming let's say. CS should stay CS.",True

@robertalatalo5904,2017-03-07T18:05:29Z,0,I enjoy your videos and found your comparison between programming and computer science funny.  Very true but completely opposite from how it's normally portrayed.   If someone can't adapt from python 2 to 3 and are worried about being taught the an out of date version I am worried about their programming.  The CS degree should give you data structures and algorithms and the tools which will be used in any language and will make you a better programmer in any language.  I though there should be some two year degree programs which focus more on programming but in the end I think it all goes back to your statement about finding some real project because once you have a real project you can learn what you don't know.,True

You have a bunch of courses that you have to take and will have no real good use for in life, and only a few of them will teach you what you actually want to learn. With self-learning you always learn specifically what you need to learn in order to solve the problem at hand, and therefore have the skill to later solve the same problem.  Formal education will tend to always give you the same generic set of problems that has been used for years or decades and that may or may not be useful in the real world. Testing and scores are an outdated concept. It should be thinking, experimenting, and trying something new instead of memorizing and regurgitating the same basic problem set.",True

Programming always seemed daunting to me. My first shot at programming was with C++ and microcontrollers in College at age 21, but C++ did not speak to me. I wanted to do creative stuff right away, but everything moved so slowly. I quit college 6 months later.  Then at age 25, after working part time at a grocery store for a couple of years, I signed up for a night time course in Python. A friend from childhood was a teacher in this course, and he suggested I join in.    After the first day, with a couple lines of code,  I had launched a window and played around with turtles in Turtle Graphics. I was hooked. Python spoke to me. My first thought was: ""Why didn't I learn about Python 10 years ago? This is what I want to do!
