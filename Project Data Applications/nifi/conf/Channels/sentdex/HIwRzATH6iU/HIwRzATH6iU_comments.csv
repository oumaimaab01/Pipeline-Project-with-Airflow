@shermanpump,2023-09-26T11:22:42Z,0,"I followed this tutorial and got it working. However I need the currency to be in GBP. I tried adding the followin hidden form value <input type=""hidden"" name=""currency_code"" value=""GBP"">,  however this didn't seem to write any data to the database via the ipn route. It was working before the change in currency, any ideas on how to fix this please? Thanks for a great tutorial",True
@idan5930,2022-07-19T18:50:03Z,0,"Hello, I hope someone here would be able to help me.  I'm using this same technique, but for some reason the custom attribute is not being shown when a user submits a payment. The odd thing here is that it does append the user a custom attribute (PayPal Dashboard), but it's not getting send as an IPN attribute, so it's basically useless.  Any help?",True
@marcova10,2021-03-20T21:42:58Z,0,"Excellent tutorial, I understand this better with Sentdex than with the pages and pages from PayPal.  PayPal should give Harrison a tip and some space for explaining how it works. Unfortunately they would not like to hear that their buttons are ugly,  One comment 6 years later....... the line    for x, y in values.iteritems(): didn't work for me, but I managed the tweak  for x, y in values.items():",True

@Blue-Scorpion,2018-03-11T09:55:26Z,0,"Hi sentdex  Why not create a layer in between view and db (service layer), so that you don't have to copy paste the logic from view handler to view handler, each time you need to do the same thing (for pay pal example there will probably not be a need for that, but generally speaking i find that to be a good practice). And i also noticed you are logging stuff into a file? Why not create a service that will have naming for example: log_successfull_payment(user, product, amount, timestamp) which would log this into a db and not a file.  Btw thanks for the video and effort.  BR",True
