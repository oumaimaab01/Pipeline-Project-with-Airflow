@superz7940,2016-05-22T08:07:03Z,2,"haha,funny, the video  just  code  tow lines,but  the what you saying is important  ,isn't it?",True
@bhushantembhurne6905,2016-02-20T09:21:50Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, why do we take y=11? and what does the variables p1,p2,p3.....upto p10 implies? Reply ASAP plz",True
@derekspeigner2406,2015-10-17T23:52:40Z,0,"Hey sentdex, where can I find more information about logarithmic normalization? Would I take the LN(currentPoint/startPoint), or is it more involved?",True
@DrDherp,2015-03-06T21:24:54Z,2,"This was a fun video. I've been working on my own algorithms the last month or so, and most of the content of this video I had as an internal conversation :D  Looking forward to see the rest of your work. Thank you for posting!",True
@gomenaros,2014-11-11T22:26:08Z,0,"Actually mathematically speaking, percentage change is [(old - new)/old]*100%, while what you 've said is the negative change. It's actually the same thing and a matter of point of view but anyway. Can't wait to watch the other vids !",True
@emoryleon3400,2014-08-08T14:51:03Z,0,Can't you also do: import pandas as pd df['Adj Close'].pct_change(),True
@szev77,2014-01-22T00:17:04Z,0,"Hi Sentdex. Was wondering about your explanation regarding the different percentage changes you for talking about. The forward percentage change sounds like a simple return. Don't quite get your reasoning between using the different types. What is the intuition of a reverse percentage change? And what do you mean by a point to point percent change i.e. what is the calculation? in terms of computational complexity, would a log return not be preferable?",True
@AlCaponeTheTrader,2013-12-30T12:20:29Z,1,"Thanks, this is fantastic. I am an amateur programmer, working towards becoming a full professional. I've bought more books on this topic since I saw your videos and I am doing a master in mathematics. Hopefully one day I will be able to match you in skill. Good luck!",True
