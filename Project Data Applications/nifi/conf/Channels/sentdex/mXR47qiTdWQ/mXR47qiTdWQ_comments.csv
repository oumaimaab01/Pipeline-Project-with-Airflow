@justinmooney9824,2018-09-10T18:08:29Z,14,"Thanks for this, Sentdex. Installing basemap was a nightmare. After trying all three methods, I was still getting an error message stating, ""python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1."" Closer inspection of this error indicated that I did not have the right version of Microsoft Visual C++, which I certainly did have.  What solved this issue for me was installing pyproj, a requisite for basemap. So you do everything outlined in the third method: Go to https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/, download the relevant whl file for pyproj, and pip install it from the command line at the correct directory. Then, you can use the same method for installing basemap.",True
@pieters286,2018-09-08T10:54:54Z,0,"Thank you for interesting tutorials:   in case I've missed it under comments: https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/  https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/intro.html Cartopy, New Management, and EoL Announcement  Starting in 2016, Basemap came under new management. The Cartopy project will replace Basemap, but it hasn’t yet implemented all of Basemap’s features. All new software development should try to use Cartopy whenever possible, and existing software should start the process of switching over to use Cartopy. All maintenance and development efforts should be focused on Cartopy.  Ben Root has volunteered to take over maintenance of Basemap until 2020. Pull requests will be reviewed, and bugs will be fixed. Also, the maintenance will ensure compatibility with packages like NumPy and Matplotlib. New features will be accepted, but we stress that new development efforts should be focused on Cartopy. When Python 2.7 is officially EoL’ed in 2020, a release of Basemap will be made and support from Ben Root will end.",True
