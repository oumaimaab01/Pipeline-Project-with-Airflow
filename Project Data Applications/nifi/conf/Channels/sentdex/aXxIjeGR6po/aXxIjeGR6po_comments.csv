@egenethebest9107,2019-01-23T20:48:01Z,2,"I don't quite like Django's approach to managing data. I am a Java EE developer and the fact that Django generates the database for you seems wrong. In my opinion you should take a bottom to top development approach. As in first design your database (making sure your data is in 3NF), and only then create the data model in your code (be it Java, Python, JavaScript or anything). If you chose you can then abstract the data model even further, however, first designing the data model, then generating the database seems extremely inefficient especially if you want to scale later on.",True
