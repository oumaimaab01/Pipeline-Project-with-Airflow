@DeepakSingh-fu1jv,2019-03-25T18:02:01Z,1,i know it is 4 yrs late but is there any way i could get those csv files with and without na both @sentdex,True
@Gewuerzgurke,2018-08-29T07:03:41Z,0,"I would prefer data_df.fillna(0) over data_df.replace(""NaN"",0)",True
@chrishenry796,2017-09-08T06:28:54Z,0,"I'm stuck on the data frame replace function for NaN and N/A using the _WITH_NA csv file.   I have data_df = data_df.replace(""NaN"",0).replace(""N/A"",0) exactly as per the video, but when I run it I get the error:  ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64').  Why are my NaNs not zeroing out?",True
@davidl9120,2016-08-06T14:07:45Z,0,"hey there, first a biig thank you for your great context, I watched all the videos and rebuild a model with my own data. Now I have however a question because I get the following error message:  ""DeprecationWarning: Passing 1d arrays as data is deprecated in 0.17 and willraise ValueError in 0.19. Reshape your data either using X.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or X.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.""  When I use the reshaping, I get another error message :  ValueError: X and y have incompatible shapes. X has 4337 samples, but y has 393.  Did anyone of you get the same message? And if yes, could you solve it? Thaanks already",True
@huiyang1118,2015-09-16T00:12:08Z,0,Where do we get the key_stats_acc_perf_WITH_NA.csv? I only see the key_stats.csv which we got berfore.,True
@ShaneBurns,2015-03-12T05:57:45Z,4,It would be really cool if you could provide over detailed notes in the actual code at the end. Obiously you are covering everything in detail but you have itterated alot of it so it would be helpful to have a MUCH summarized logic/explaination as possible to reference at a later date.Â ,True
