@noonansean1979,2016-12-07T21:46:55Z,0,"Just FYI Gauss is pronounced with the vowel sound like the word ""out"", or ""ouch"".  So it sounds like house but with a G in front not like gauze or gossip.  And with Gaussian we don't pronounce the double s with an 'sh"" sound.  I know it's pedantic, and I know you're self taught but the mathematician Gauss is such an important figure it's kind of like hearing some say Einstone and then spelling his name Inestone. If you're going to name a variable after Gauss you may as well include both s letters too.  It's just good form.  Edit:  Also I'm not trying to be rude here but helpful.  It's hard being self taught, I know.  But there are just certain names that when mathematicians or computer scientists hear them mispronounced they just cringe.  The easiest to mispronounce being Euler.",True
