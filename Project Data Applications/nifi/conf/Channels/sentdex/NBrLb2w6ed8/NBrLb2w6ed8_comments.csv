@joshuadawson4952,2018-10-18T19:23:06Z,0,How can I count days from when an event occurred and how long it took that event to recover? Example. On 2018-02-08 the High was 2944 the market dropped 100+ points. I want to calculate how many days it took to return to the previous High 2944 of date  2018-02-08. Any help or guidance is much appreciated,True
