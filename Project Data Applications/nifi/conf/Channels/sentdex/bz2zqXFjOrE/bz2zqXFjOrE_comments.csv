@oludhe7,2020-08-04T14:44:40Z,3,"For those of you tearing your hair out to figure out why even after changing from Event to Input in the @app.callback, it still doesn't work; it's because the Input is now being given as an input into the function 'update_graph_scatter'. I simply fixed this by putting a random variable into the function call 'update_graph_scatter(graph_update)' and it worked.   I worked this out by looking into the error on the dashboard - 'TypeError: update_graph_scatter() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given'. Just add whatever you want in there - you don't necessarily need to reference it as the input is just a refresh call every second.  Also, change the Input in the @app.callback from [Input('graph-update', 'interval')] to [Input('graph-update', 'n_intervals')] as the object in the back is now called 'n_intervals' from the dcc.Interval call",True

@saulsalcedo7134,2019-02-20T19:47:13Z,0,"Hello, is it possible to do this but with a database in mysql ?, I have been able to connect to my database and get the data but I still do not know how to read them in the graph, I would like the 'X' to show me the 'value 'those come from the database and the 'timestamp' in the 'Y', which is the time and date, those also take them from the database.

@aurel3117,2018-03-02T16:18:28Z,1,I don't know if you had the idea but add in the graph the word   recurrent positive or negative that goes with the value. This will be fun and your graph will be more taklable. (Sorry for this english),True
