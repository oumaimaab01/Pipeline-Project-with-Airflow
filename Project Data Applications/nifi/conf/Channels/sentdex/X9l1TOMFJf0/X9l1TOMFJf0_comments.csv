@vladimirtchuiev2218,2022-06-17T07:05:18Z,0,"It's easier to build a decent bot if you have some domain knowledge. For example, voidrays in general are bad vs Terran because of marines, vikings, and ravens. Colossi are more of a safe bet. 22 workers per mining base is optimal, whether to go to 66 or 88 depends on your play style preference I guess. But an interesting series nonetheless, I'm more interested in the deep learning side of things, for example a network that can handle building placement or general army movements and high level decisions. Building an end to end reinforcement learning algorithm for SC2 that works is borderline impossible without google-grade hardware.",True

@SchpiriTi,2020-01-09T20:24:38Z,0,"Hi! First of all: Really great stuff - a lot of fun following and coding along. Was an insta-subscribe! I was wondering: In your refreshed attack method with the dictionary you iterate over the Unit types. And then each time you check ""Amount of [UNIT] > 15/8"" and ""Amount of [UNIT] > 8/3"". Am I seeing something wrong or is condition2 always going to be given if condition 1 is given? I am kinda new to programming and stuff and mostly did Data Analysis. So if I actually have a mistake there in thinking I'd be glad!   Wouldn't it otherwise make more sense to iterate over both Unittypes at the same time and for example check ""Amount of [STALKER] > 15"" and ""Amount of [VOIDRAYS] > 8"" - yeah lets go attack?",True

I wanted to suggest you look at a very light-weight high level programming language called lua. It's miles faster than python, can work with libraries/modules, super easy to learn, is supported by a tensor processing library ( for machine learning ofc) called called Torch ( see torch.ch ), has a very popular JIT compiler that makes it even faster called LuaJIT, and can even probably include some C libraries and dlls if I'm not wrong (with luajit at least anyway). Torch is not a static-graph ML tool though, it's dynamic. Maybe you find that bad but perhaps you can learn a new ML way of thinking by trying it. Yes there is PyTorch but I'm mainly interested in Lua.If you want IDE that has demos on it and downloads the binaries of lua for you, I suggest using ZeroBraneStudio.  Ahoy!~",True

@benjaminjaton3597,2018-06-27T04:53:29Z,1,"Curious to see how far you're going to go with this. Right now your approach is to write a strategy (~stalker/voidray) and then to use deep learning to optimize it as much as possible. Usually a player does a round of ""scouting"" around minute 1/2 with a probe to get info on the opponent's position+strategy, and decide on what to build accordingly. So the opponent's existing/pending buildings and units could be part of the features for the learning. As a protoss you can also build ""observers"" which are ""invisible"" units that can spy on the enemy base, getting you better intel so that you make better strategic choices, like start mass producing a certain kind of unit or anticipating where the opponent will attack. The number of possible inputs AND outputs is just insane. But so fun, best of luck!",True
