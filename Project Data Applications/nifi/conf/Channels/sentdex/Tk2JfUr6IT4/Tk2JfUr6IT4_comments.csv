@samio54321,2016-03-21T16:59:17Z,0,"Thanks for the video, and the dataset!! I enjoyed a lot. But the nested try/except loops seems to be a bit buggy. I am quite certain that the final plot is not correct (Apple Inc. out perform S&P 500 by 3000 percentage points!?!??). It seems there are some bugs in the 3-day 'holiday-shift' part. In the end I have to replace nearly all the try/except by if/else to make sure all the data properly extracted.",True

@garethgriffiths6846,2014-12-31T17:04:07Z,0,"Hi Harrison, in tutorial 9 at 24.45, your graph has a structure that is different to the one in tutorial 10. This can be seen in Apple's structure. With the try and excepts you placed in after in order to catch the problem you were after (in tutorial 9), the structure of the graphs have changed, also visible on Apple's graph. I'm not sure if you were happy with the conclusion of your search towards the end of tutorial 9 with all those try and excepts, but there is definitely something that has changed. Just thought I'd share. Cheers",True
