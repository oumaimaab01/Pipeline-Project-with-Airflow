But I guess using running the same code locally increased the time (instead of decreasing) on adding the condition `if i % 5000 == 0: await asyncio.sleep(0.0001)`. The one thing I don't understand is even if you perform blocking, it just stops the current loop and executes another. However, it has to perform all the computations. So, you are not blocking the coroutine while it is waiting, you are doing while the computation is equal to some number. So it need to perform the computation  again once it resumes.
