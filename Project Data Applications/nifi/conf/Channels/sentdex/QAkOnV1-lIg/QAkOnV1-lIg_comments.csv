@justjoy7179,2019-07-20T20:26:54Z,0,"The moving average found in the video is, I beleive is calculated wrong. It is because the data in csv file is such that head denotes the end date while tail denotes the start date. So when you find moving average above, you get NaN in the first 99 entities(from head) while beyond that you get the desired numbers(till tail). But in real case, we need moving average from the present date, which means, we require moving average of dates from the very first date of head side while we should be getting NaN for last 99 dates on tail side. Example lets say we take data such that  start =(2019,1,1) end = (2019,1,30) thus head of our table would be 30 Jan 2019 and tail would be 1 Jan 2019. Now if we find ma for, say, 10 days, by your method, we would be getting NaN for 9 days (which is 21 Jan to 30 Jan) and then we would be getting numbers for rest. The point I am trying to make is if we need to use this method for real analysis purpose, we will have to invert the data, right? If yes, is there a easy way...as i tried swapping start and end, but didn't work out. [lets assume we have data of all 30 days with us, although in real we dont't due to Sat. and Sun.]   Please explain it if I am wrong...I am confused!!",True
