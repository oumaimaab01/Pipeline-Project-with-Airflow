@alicememegirl7389,2019-07-30T11:27:46Z,1,"Bro, i need this code so much, but i have problem while using python 3.5:   ..     Server part is require server_socket.listen() argument and wont start without it. I google this problem and after set it ""2"" because i'm expecting for 2 connections. After that the server part is running (without any prints).      Client is fail on part of sending message after i type it, so it give me ""BlockingIOError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable"". The username input part is working properly, but there is no actions in server window, no connections notifier.     Also in client part i set username_header = username and message_header = message because i cant use f strings. It's a shame, but i don't get what those two is stands for. If problem in that part i still can't get what is going on with a server_socket.listen(???). Is that because of python version i'm using?     Please help me someone, i can't solve it :(",True

I just have a little suggestion to you that I think would make your videos more awesome. Before writing any line of code that might not be obvious for the viewers to imagine and see why it's used, please explain a little bit about it or what the end result would be, sometimes it's hard for us to figure out and try to formulate as we what the end result might be. Like at  3:10 you explained why we used setsockopt () but at  14:20 and  17:30 it started to get cluttered up very fast and I got lost. Just a little input from my side.

@slavoie,2019-04-07T00:08:45Z,6,"22:09 The code runs!!! :) Superb tutorial! As always, it's fun to watch. By the way, if I may, I would suggest splitting long lines so that you don't have to zoom out. As long as parentheses are used, you can pretty much cut the string wherever you want for any kind of statement, like: print(f'Very long {text_variable} going '          'here and continuing there. '          'Actually with proper indentation of course.')   Thank you. Your kitchen must be filled with quite a huge collection of mugs, that's also entertaining :).",True

@bloodgain,2019-04-03T04:31:44Z,1,"Good start to this tutorial; I'm looking forward to seeing the next part.   Minor quibble with your receive_message function: since your ""good"" return value is a dict, it's really better if you return an empty dict on failure, or at least None, rather than False. Multivariate return types are problematic because they are less predictable to users and require extra -- and usually non-Pythonic -- handling code everywhere the function is called. Pandas does this, and it drives me nuts, but there's no other package that approaches what it does. None gets a pass because it's a non-value, and ""may return None"" is considered a standard function contract by the Python community -- which, of course, you'd say explicitly in your docstring.   Since both None and empty dict are ""falsey"", you can still check with ""if [not] message:"", though some ""ask forgiveness, not permission"" diehards will say you should really just _try_ to access message and handle the empty/None case in the except clause. Note that the latter method is _only_ advisable in Python, though, and using exceptions for flow control is frowned upon in most programming languages.",True
