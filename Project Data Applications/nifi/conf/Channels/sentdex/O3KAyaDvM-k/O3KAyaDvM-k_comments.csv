@zhidongzhao1332,2023-04-17T15:15:06Z,0,"In computer programming, there are many situations where you may need to add new data to an existing file or array. This is where the term AppendMe comes in. Essentially, AppendMe is a command that tells the program to add new data to an existing file or array.  The AppendMe command is often used in situations where you need to keep track of data over time. For example, if you are working on a program that needs to keep track of customer orders, you may use the AppendMe command to add new orders to an existing file or array.  One of the great things about the AppendMe command is that it allows you to add new data to an existing file or array without overwriting any existing data. This means that you can keep all of your data in one place, without having to worry about losing any important information.  Another benefit of using the AppendMe command is that it is a relatively simple and straightforward command to use. In most programming languages, you can simply call the AppendMe command and pass in the data that you want to add to the file or array.  Overall, AppendMe is a term that is commonly used in computer programming, specifically in the context of adding data to an existing file or array. It is a powerful command that allows you to keep track of data over time, without overwriting any existing data. If you are working on a program that requires you to add new data to an existing file or array, the AppendMe command is definitely something that you should be familiar with.",True

@tissot08,2018-04-23T22:24:21Z,0,"Thanks for your excellent tutorials: just have a question, I'm working on an existing file (Openstack), it's an env file which I can open with sublime or notepad++. Here's the content: # Version 11.02.12.000.09.03    parameters:   vlb_volume_name_0: data   vlb_volume_name_1: log   vlb_volume_name_2: config   vlb_volume_size_0: 5   vlb_volume_size_1: 5   vlb_volume_size_2: 5   vlb_volume_type_0: SF-Platinum-Plus-SSD   vlb_volume_type_1: SF-Platinum-Plus-SSD   vlb_volume_type_2: SF-Platinum-Plus-SSD  How do I create a script that will give me this output, basically keeping everything except adding the info of the 1st 3 lines. Is it easier to add text in between or just overwrite the 'data', 'log', and 'config' text by below? Also I got a lot of env files that I need to open and paste data so I'm hoping to create simple script that can do the job.  # Version 11.02.12.000.09.03    parameters:   vlb_volume_name_0: rvlbmm01gtp001_vol_data   vlb_volume_name_1: rvlbmm01gtp001_vol_log   vlb_volume_name_2: rvlbmm01gtp001_vol_config   vlb_volume_size_0: 5   vlb_volume_size_1: 5   vlb_volume_size_2: 5   vlb_volume_type_0: SF-Platinum-Plus-SSD   vlb_volume_type_1: SF-Platinum-Plus-SSD   vlb_volume_type_2: SF-Platinum-Plus-SSD  Appreciate any help:",True

@jasoncprince,2017-05-20T15:19:10Z,0,"Just wanted to share my experience with this tutorial.  @ 1:32 different ways of adding new lines was shown. This gave me an error.  This is my code.

State what to add in quotations 2. appendFile = open('exampleFile.txt', 'a')  # Open desired file with full path in quotation.
