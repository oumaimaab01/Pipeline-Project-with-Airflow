@TheDonMan97,2017-12-21T17:31:16Z,15,"Guys.... Even though I appreciate Sentdex for making the video, this tutorial wouldn't work for most people since it is a bit out-dated  This is how I installed for 64-bit Windows 10:  1. First, download the CUDA 8.0 for Windows 10.  Link found here:  https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive  2. Then, once it finishes installing on to your computer, now you have to make three Paths on the Environmental variables: For me, they were:      #1. C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin     #2. C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\libnvvp     #3. C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\extras\CUPTI\libx64  3. Next, you need to download the NVIDIA Drivers required for CUDA 8.0. You can download the drivers for your GPU      The link is here: http://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-uk and choose your GPU and install its driver  4. The next step is to download CUDA6.0. Even though, it says you need to install CUDA 6.1, I read on one of the NVDIA forums that it is a typo. Follow Sentdex's link and log in and install the CUDA6.0. You won't be able to find the 6.1 version anyway.   5. You should have downloaded a zip folder with a folder called ""cuda"". Extract it to C:\ drive. Not replace the files in it like what Sentdex did.   6. Create a path on the environmental variables : C:\cuda\bin  7. It's done! Now, open up your python terminal on Command Prompt. Type import tensorflow as tf. It will take a while! But, it should eventually come up.",True

Do not download the latest version even if it is available. I tried CUDA 9.0 with various versions of cudnn but it all failed. Besides, you will need Visual Studio 2015 installed as stated in CUDA documentation. I used 2017 and there was an installation warning so I didn't take the risk and reinstalled 2015. For VS 2015, it is not available on the frontpage of VS. You must search for it on the VS website, via the search function or older versions or something like that.  Another error I encountered was failure of CUDA 9.0 installation (might happen on 8.0 or supported 9.0 in the future). The error was that Nvidia container installation failed.
