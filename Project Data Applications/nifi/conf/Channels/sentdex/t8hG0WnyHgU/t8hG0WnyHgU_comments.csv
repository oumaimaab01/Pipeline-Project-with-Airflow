@kdscheer,2020-04-12T17:12:54Z,0,"I am using Sublime Text version 3.2.2, build 3211, which is the latest version.  I am following the tutorial closely.  My output is displaying slightly different from yours.  The ‚Äúprint(count, row)‚Äù code in the last line results in an output that includes the parentheses both before and after each row of the game board as well as an unwanted comma displayed after the row count.  Like this:         a  b c (0, [0, 0, 0]) (1, [0, 0, 0]) (2, [0, 0, 0])  I proceeded to change the last code line to be ‚Äúprint count, row‚Äù - by just removing the parentheses in that line of code.  When I do this, the word ‚Äúprint‚Äù changes from light blue to pink in color.  Then output works, and the parentheses before and after each row in the game board are now gone (so the display now matches what is in the video tutorial).  What is going on here?  Should I continue to leave the last code line as I have it now, or will this mess something up in future modules of this tutorial?  Alternatively, I could leave the code to match yours exactly and just accept the parentheses showing up on the game board output.  I suspect this is do to some setting/issue with Sublime Text as when I run the script as I have it (without the parentheses in the line of last line of code) in Xubuntu Xfce‚Äôs terminal,  I get an error message asking if I had meant for the parentheses to be there.  So, I went back to the ‚Äútutorial2.py‚Äù code and changed it back to how you have demonstrated in the tutorial.  When I then run the program in terminal with python3, it displays just as a you had intended.  Is there a setting in Sublime I need to change?  Thanks.",True

@darekwroblewski1090,2019-10-09T16:44:55Z,97,"For clarification (5:20) count is not related to the function count() and the reason there is a comma (//from code\\ for count *,* row in enum...)  is because he is working with two variables, he declared as count and row. You could also write that in brackets if it helps you understand it better like such: for (count, row) in enumerate(game):     print (count, row) Since, enumerate pumps out two values i.e. the index and the element like this: (index, [row]) (0, [0, 0, 0]) (1, [0, 0, 0]) (2, [0, 0, 0])   All sentdex did was specify that he wants to call the two variables (index and element) count and row and then just referenced them afterwards like this :     print (count, row) resulting in:     0  1  2 0 [0, 0, 0] 1 [0, 0, 0] 2 [0, 0, 0]   reason for commenting: got confused about the comma, wanted to save people the hassle of googling about.",True
