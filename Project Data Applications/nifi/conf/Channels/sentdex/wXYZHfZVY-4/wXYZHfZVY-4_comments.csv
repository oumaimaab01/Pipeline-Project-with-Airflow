@cleisonarmandomanriqueagui9176,2023-04-04T18:42:44Z,0,Can I code this dron with python ?,True
@charlesperry4295,2022-05-20T21:16:36Z,0,9:09 Yeah but that is basically the equivelent of taking down a lemonade stand because it doesn't have a bussiness license assuming there is no radio interfirence and your not flying to high. and I'm sure the police and government have other more pressing issues the pursuing a random person flying a custom drone in their own yard that's not interfering with any thing else.,True

@xyzoblivion,2017-01-01T20:19:57Z,0,"great series, learned a lot really, but it would be very nice if you could do a series on how to actually program this beast from the scratch. Anyway, keep up the good work.",True

@intelcore2duo266,2016-10-06T06:47:56Z,0,"Hey Harrison! Love the 'power to the people' motif of all your videos haha. Getting to the point though, you haven't continued this quadcopter series for a while. Waiting for the programming part of the series you mention in the intro video! Any chance it'll come out soon?",True
@satyamsingh6208,2016-09-20T15:01:47Z,0,The series really helped. Waiting for the use of raspberry pi in the quadcopter and the different sensors .,True
@jodumagpi,2016-08-07T17:03:26Z,0,"you really are my savior! can you do a video tutorial on how to use raspberry pi on board quadcopters to make them autonomous? use it not as a controller because there are bunch of controllers out there like pixhawk, i don't know maybe use it with the pi camera to recognize stuff?",True
@hellfiresl,2016-07-14T14:12:10Z,1,"I have a question. Since the Raspberry Pi is like a computer and needs to be poweroff everytime you unplug the battery, how are you going to do it automatically? I am thinking about using a capacitor to temporally supply power for raspberry to shutdown, but still lacking lots of modification in the circuit to make everything automatic.",True
@hellfiresl,2016-07-14T12:45:28Z,1,"I think accelerometer and altimeter is already equipped on the flight controller together with gyrometer and compass. Lately, I have been trying to install a remote controlled firework launcher on my quadcopter, and make everything controlled through my joystick, to make it looks like flying AH-64 and firing rockets in a video game.   lol",True
@theitalian94,2016-04-24T01:24:44Z,1,Its a nice idea but if the drone doesn't fly better its nonsense I guess ... Have you seen how it flew? In a circle. Normaly you have to trim the aircraft first. If it fly's like this flying is no fun. If it would fly better it makes more fun.,True
