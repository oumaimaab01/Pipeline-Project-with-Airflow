@spillitnow,2022-08-01T16:22:29Z,0,"I know this is 8 years old but a couple things bug me about the code.   The pin numbers should be constants, not numbers. Then instead of the parameter being 11, it could be FRONT_RIGHT, for example. You could further abstract by putting the function gpio.output(FRONT_RIGHT, True) inside of a better named function front_right_forward(). And you could have a front_right_reverse(), etc.  Also why is the time frame tf? Why not just call it time_frame? Or better yet, time_frame_seconds to indicate the unit of time. The abbreviation just adds a mental step when it would be really easy to autocomplete (depending on the IDE; I'm pretty sure there's a way to do it in nano).  So then the forward function would be: def forward(time_frame_seconds):   init()   front_left_forward()   front_right_forward()   back_left_forward()   back_right_forward()   time.sleep(time_frame_seconds)   cleanup()  I know this is just a personal project and not production code, but readable code is important, especially if you want to scale it out, like if you want to make a self-driving car that chases moving objects or maps out a room or something.",True

@govindabaweja3549,2018-12-05T03:17:52Z,0,"Hello I have a question, I am using similar code for servo motor, but I want to use distance sensor with it. So I wrote a code, for servo motor to move when distance sensor senses some specific distance. But in my code, servo motor is continuously moving and not coming to the rest position. Is there any way you can help me with this please? Is there any way I can share my code with you so that you can look at it, and let me know what is going on. Thank you for your help in advance.",True

@mojitoz2211,2016-10-29T08:09:36Z,0,hello sir i just have a problem... when i write your code on my rpi he doesn't work and he says that he's working but i think there is a problem becuz with the definitions code def() cuz i've done another program without definition and then my wheels works. What can I do becuz it's really better to work with def().,True

@vishamr2000,2015-12-26T11:33:54Z,0,Hello Sentdex...Many thanks for the tutorials..Really helpful...I was trying to set up the 4 motors and had them connected to the H-bridge and raspberry Pi..I didnt connect the battery pack to the H-bridge and I simply powered the Raspberry pi. The thing is the AC power adapter got burnt when I switch the Raspberry Pi on. I believe the setup was drawing too much power (more than 5V) and hence burnt the adapter. can you pls tell me what I did wrong and how to correct it? Thx in advance.,True

@rajreadss,2015-12-05T01:16:46Z,0,Hey Sentex just wanted to say great videos man. I'm actually using the exact same materials as you and when I run the robot2.py script only 1 set of the wheels run and the other set does not. could this be due to the wiring? thanks,True

@huckleberry582,2015-08-23T09:00:48Z,0,"Really glad I found your videos. I'm pretty new to this and am curious where how you learned Python or what you might recommend to learn it. Copying and pasting is alright to get started just so I know that something is working, but I'd like to be able to understand it well enough to write my own for the robot I make. I realize there is an abundance of books and tutorials out there, but the way you explain things is easy to follow so I wanted to know how you learned it. Thanks",True
@Sam_A,2015-06-24T01:27:00Z,0,hey when i plug in my battery while the pi is off it turns the pi on and makes one motor spin should i plug in the micro usb power to it or i would overvolt it,True

@spidybdp,2015-05-09T20:58:17Z,0,"Hey, your tuts are amazing. Subbed! They're so descriptive and easy to follow through. But I am having trouble, I am using 2 motors instead of 4, but that shouldn't be a problem.
