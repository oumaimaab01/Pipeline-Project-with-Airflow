@TheLokiwizz,2019-02-24T12:53:57Z,1,"I have been following along, and up until now everything has been fine. but when i added the code for the refiend time it has broken. ive even copy pasta'd your full code from the text based tut. not sure whats goin on. here is my error.   self.time = (self.state.game_loop/22.4) / 60 AttributeError: can't set attribute anyone else following along run into this?  love your content man, Keep it up.",True

@juhotuho10,2018-07-22T10:58:49Z,0,"I do not know how hard it would be to implement, but adding enemy actions as inputs so that the AI can react to them and act accordingly would probably make it superbly better and i think it would enable it to play against it self since it can implement counter strategies to let's say early rushing and prepare better for lategame if the enemy doesn't rush early instead of working so that preparing for a early rushing works slightly better most of the time so it's always optimal to do so.",True

@ardentdata,2018-07-21T22:44:04Z,0,"Just wanted to make a quick point, I think you are on absolutely the right track with your latest SC2 plan, but I would make one suggestion... I would break up the game into (at minimum) two major classes of tasks for an AI to learn, macro and micro... so taking your 14 point option list I would have the build order (macro per sae) be one decision (model) while army or unit commands (micro) a second entire model, that way, you can also illustrate in your series how to use multiple specific models in a project, as well as allow for a good follow-up up ping-pong training between the two models to get better long term results... all my opinion of course and just want to thank you for the time of making the series, its entertaining and often gives me another point of view to consider",True
@TOCZEKX,2018-07-21T21:53:15Z,0,I hope that you will continue this series for the long long time and huge numer of parts.,True
@migkillerphantom,2018-07-21T21:50:53Z,1,"About the resource bars on the lower left - why not just feed them into the fully connected layer of your network? Can't the neural net just figure out to weigh a couple of perceptrons quite heavily compared to all the convolutional ones?   I'm just getting into machine learning, but it seems like you're really asking the net to do a lot of additional work that way, passing all those pixels through the image processor when they are really just scalar values. I am not trying to criticize since I don't have any experience myself, I am asking this because I am interested in the answer.",True

@derstreber2,2018-07-21T17:57:16Z,1,"@sentdex  One concern that I have is that the bars you are drawing for stats like population, minerals, etc., they are actually overlapping part of the playable area of the map. If another ai or a player or its self where to make a base in that area, your ai would be blind in that corner of the map. (in general I think it would throw the learning algorithm off ) There are multiple was of dealing with this, one that comes to mind is simply making the output image lager than the map and then adding the bars in underneath or to the sides or both. I don't know if the ai will become confused if cannot assume the extent of the image is equivalent to the map. Perhaps a boundary color around the entire map in the image is necessary? Perhaps not. You will need to think on that one. Of coarse this would all require recollecting data, thought I'd let you know before you do the color changes to the mapping code.   glhf",True

@ProjectSuperSport,2018-07-21T16:12:42Z,0,"Hey sentdex, love this series! A quick question - don't you think that giving the ""do nothing"" choice of action a consistent time period, would benefit the algrothim? Both in training and prefromance, I think that a more predictable action lets the bot a much better chance of learning to use it right. Ideally I would set it to be just a second or two, not to get stuck at it for too long.",True
@fanjerry8100,2018-07-21T15:57:14Z,1,Could you make a livestream of it while training? Maybe have the camera automatically go to where a unit was produced or a weapon was fired.,True
