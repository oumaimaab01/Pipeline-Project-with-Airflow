@quantza8723,2016-02-19T02:50:40Z,0,"Hello,  I really appreciate all of your series on data analysis, they have been incredibly helpful.  I was wondering if you cold recommend a good laptop for programming.  I have an i75930K PC with 32gb of DDR4 RAM running Windows 7 Pro 64bit which handles large data files handily.  I want to purchase a good laptop that I can do some data analysis with while chilling out of doors on the weekends.  One of the difficulties that I'm running into is finding a new model with good specs that DOES NOT have Windows 10 installed , or where Windows 10 can be removed--one of the models that I had my eye on would not allow WIn/10 to be removed/replaced.  I'd like to be able run Windows 7 ( I really don't like any of the versions after 7) with an i7 series cpu, minimum 16gb RAM an SSD main drive and a 1TB HDD for storage   I would use this laptop for writing and editing scripts with smaller chunks of data (like 2-3 years of 8 minute intra-day Emini data).  Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you,  Ana",True

@tomm2481,2015-06-18T15:59:27Z,0,"Pretty cool stuff.  When I plot using your code though, I get the same graph, but it doesn't let me slide it around like you could.  Also, you get the labels ""Price"" and ""500MA"" however I only get ""close"" for the upper graph and ""None"" for the lower graph.   Any idea on what could cause those differences?",True

@GodAmoungMen85,2014-10-19T14:14:57Z,0,Why is the does the rolling mean plot range from -3 to three. Shouldn't it be on the order of the stock price?,True
@gregdeng8722,2014-08-25T08:17:47Z,0,Thank you for the tutorials ! Where can i find the data of this video?thank you ,True
