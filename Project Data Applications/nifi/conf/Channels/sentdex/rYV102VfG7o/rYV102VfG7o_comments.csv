@lefebrero,2018-05-04T20:28:59Z,0,"Hey! I apologize in advance because this is going to be a long comment. Thank you in advance.  I intend to use this to backtest FOREX strategies. I need to record the Balance and the Equity of the account at every price, in a certain base currency.  Lets say my account's base currency is USD. If I open a EURUSD trade (or any other pair in which the currency of the trade's pnl is USD), there is no problem in calculating the balance and equity, since the pnl of the trade and the account share the same currency. However, if I open a GBPCAD trade, I also need to know the price of the USDCAD in order to be able to ""translate"" the pnl of the trade, which it would be (in this case) in CAD, to the account's base currency, and calculate Balance, Equity, Margin and Margin Level. So my question is, would it be possible to do this? Also, how can I control the account's leverage, in order to be able to calculate margin and margin level? And my last question: where should I look in order to learn how to code the strategies, any documentation or tutorial or something?  I really appreciate your videos, they are very helpful, thank you!",True
