@philiperiskallaleal6010,2018-11-30T12:34:26Z,0,"Dear all,  Thank you for the video.  I was wondering whether one could apply the same concepts of your video in order to plot a 4D data (x= longitude, y=latitude, z=time, k=attribute value) in a 3D matplotlib structure. The color of the plot would be the Kth dimension, an alpha (transparency) parameter would be needed in order to be able to visualize the data within the data.  Typical cases can be found in Astronomy and remote sensing science. Typical file formats that store that kind of info are NETCDF and HDF.  I thank you for your time,  Sincerely yours,  Philipe Leal",True
