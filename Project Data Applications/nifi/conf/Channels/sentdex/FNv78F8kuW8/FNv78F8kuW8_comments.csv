@Nickcastro1520,2017-04-03T17:33:33Z,0,hey whats up thanks for all the videos of a whole bunch of different subjects. but I had a question would I be able to make the commands into a remote ? instead of using terminal to run the scripts? thanks,True
@alfredsedky3803,2016-06-16T00:58:01Z,0,"when you wrote the code of def turn_left , why did you wrote that 15 is False?.",True
@existentialchild698,2016-01-28T19:19:14Z,1,Great! This code is useful just a few more things and my robot project will be perfect!,True
@sentdex,2015-04-10T17:21:40Z,1,"Jamie Reason True and False are the result of a boolean. This goes to the very core of every computer in existence today. At the core, computers are the make up of many switches, where you have two choices: On or off, the result of either an electrical signal, or not, in the case of robotics. This is why the very basic  code, called binary code, is built of 0's and 1's. Thus, we still use True and False today, especially when working with hardware. The python programming language itself, and every other programming language, just makes this a little easier for you, but every command translates to combinations of 0's and 1's in the end.  In summary, this is how we can use programs to communicate with hardware, since hardware can easily be charged, or not.  Things begin to get truly fascinating as of late, where researchers have begun to use biological switches, which can also be programmed. Lots of fascinating information on biological programming, using E. coli for example.",True

@sinfluxmajor,2014-11-14T11:37:45Z,1,Awesome Tutorial man.. Had all the parts and tore it from my arduino to do these.. Watched and build alongside all the way through.. Just on Turn right though.. I think its actually  7 = False 11 = True 13 = True 15 = True,True
