I'm a newbie on python and programming in general and I have a problem right now that's kinda like what you show here. I've extracted a table from a website (using the api) and the results come in text (csv). I get around 20 different statistics (it's sports-related) and I only need 3 of them. So I would like to eliminate all the data that I don't need and just get those 3. Would you recommend the same Library modules (re and urllib) or another module to do that? As I said, it looks to be the same kinda thing you're showing here, the difference being that I need to basically remove stats instead of text when I scrape it and just get the one I need.

Using your code I was finally able to get python to pull the info I needed from a html page. Now that I have it displaying a list using the 'Findall' function, I want to be able to use it to make decisions about what else to copy.  I currently have my 'FindAll' function set to a HTML tag that will always return a number from 0 to 200. My goal is to make it so any number it returns above 8 will also return the items name from a different, yet corresponding HTML tag.  I know how to set up the if/and/or clauses, but where I am getting stuck is how to tell python to choose the right HTML tag that corresponds with the correct number (instead of just giving me the first on the list). This is because each item has it's own version of the same HTML tag.  What is the best way to correlate HTML tags together? In example: each item has both <div class=""name""> and <div class=""quantity"">. How can I make it so any of the ""quantity"" tags returned above 8 will also give me the ""<div class=""name"">"" of that specific item? I only want the names of the tags with a value above 8, the rest can be skipped.   Preferrably, I'd like it to list out all items above 8 with it's corresponding name.   I hope that makes sense.

Programming enables you to increase your production and performance nearly infinitely and it can grow exponentially. Programming allows you to extend your logic and your will out of your body and into the world in a way that only programming can achieve through the use of machines. It can become an extension of your self. Programs work while you sleep, they work while you take a vacation. They continue working while you work on something else. Programming has allowed me to start up and scale multiple businesses, almost completely without any direct help. Programming has allowed me to work for myself. I choose when I work, what I work on, and what I learn about. Programming has given me freedom. Others gave it to me. I want to give it to you.",True
