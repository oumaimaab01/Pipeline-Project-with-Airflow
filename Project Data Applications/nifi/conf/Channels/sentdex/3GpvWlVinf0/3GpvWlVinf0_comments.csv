I have a function which takes in one parameter, and outputs a medium sized summary table of the computed results, as a pandas DataFrame. What I'd like to do is call this function in a loop thousands of times, with different parameter values, producing thousands of DataFrames. I then want to extract certain columns (series) from each summary DataFrame and create a new DataFrame (SUPER DF) with that information. What is the best way to structure this? I could call the loop and run the function directly in the new program, but it takes some moments to run - and doing it thousands of times every time this is run would not be fun. Also, if for some reason a singular run of it needed to be redone, it would be simpler to just run that one, have the data saved, and run the SUPER DF function separately.  Would it make sense to save each individual dataframe summary as a pickle? Then the Super DF program would loop through and load from each individual pickle? That would be a lot of individual pickles to read in (or CSVs, probably slower).  I'd appreciate some guidance, thanks much!",True

@user-kf8fj2mc7u,2015-09-23T21:04:57Z,0,"Hi +sentdex! I see you have many interesting courses on machine learning and it's techniques. I would like to learn them all, but unfortunately, I can't, due to lack of time. Sometimes I'm just lazy though (let's be fair here). So I need to pick one to solve the task, that I have in my mind - image recognition and analyzis. Which one should I take? Suggestion: you can add explanations on what this or that course does, because those ""scikit"", ""sklib"", ""matplotlib"" and other cryptic names mean absolutely nothing to me (I would even say it's confusing). You would be surprised, but it is possible despite I am familiar with python and I use django on daily basis. So yeah, just a lil UX hint. I wish you all good and I'm glad I found you. Edit: Found ""Pattern recognition"" on the website. Is that it?",True
