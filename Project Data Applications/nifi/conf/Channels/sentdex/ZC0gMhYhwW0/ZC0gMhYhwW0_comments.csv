@hoaxuan7074,2021-01-14T02:52:03Z,1,"If you add a bunch of numbers you are doing a dot product! The vector <1,1,....1> dot the bunch of numbers in vector form. Likewise adding and subtracting a bunch of numbers is a dot product. For example <+1,-1,-1,+1,........> dot the bunch of numbers. Using certain patterns of adding and subtracting you get the fast Walsh Hadamard transform. Which you can view as a system of orthogonal dot products. Where the cost per dot product is a very low log2(n) add subtract operations. Anyway for NEAT you can look up the Continuous Gray Code Optimization algorithm pdf online. The mutation function is very simple but effective. Random + or - a.exp(-p.rnd()). If the parameter being mutated is constrained between -1 and 1 then a is 2. p is the so called precision of the mutation and is positive. rnd() returns a uniform random between 0 and 1.",True
@hoaxuan7074,2021-01-14T02:37:38Z,1,Training algorithms can only hope to explore the full solution space of small neural nets. With large conventional nets its seems you only get to explore a much smaller space of statistical solutions. No single neuron can be so exceptional. Neurons have to work together in statistical groups.  You can see this clearly with Fast Transform fixed-filter-bank neural nets where each neuron is forcebly connected to all the neurons in the previous layer. Then statistical behaviour is the only thing possible.,True

There is a lot of code to copy paste to just run it, but that is because the python-neat is not really first and formost a Neural Networks package, it is a genetic algorithm package (dont know if that was the intent, but thats how they coded it). Thus it expects you to define the genes and how they should behave. The pacgage then runs this in its evolutionary system.

By that, I mean how do you go about understanding it and translating it into code? I usually don't understand what goes on until I read a reference implementation, which is not always available.",True

@Stinosko,2021-01-06T18:09:58Z,2,"I wonder  1) can neat algorithm be used for real time learning? For example with the pole environment, every time it run a game it adjusts the network without needing to live in batches and populations? My initial impression of this implementation it can't?  2) can you feed in a starting networking and improve that network. For example for the detection of hand writing: learn the initial complex part by a reinforced or conventional algorithm on a online databases of hand writings. Than use that network for neat with a new (smaller) batch of images of your own handwriting quicker? ",True
