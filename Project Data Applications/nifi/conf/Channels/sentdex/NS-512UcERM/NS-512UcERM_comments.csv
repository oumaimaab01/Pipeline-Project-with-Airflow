@GoredGored,2020-10-14T20:08:00Z,0,While creating my function as shown  sentiment_factor = sentiment.sentiment_signal.latest I got an attribute error  'Field' object has no attribute 'latest' to overcome that you need to run the following from quantopian.pipeline.data.sentdex import sentiment   For more go to Quantopian.,True

@petters.jensen8287,2018-11-29T14:47:37Z,1,"Hi Sentdex!  How would you test alpha factors on minute data instead of daily data? I assume you have to use get_pricing, and this needs to be done outside the pipeline?",True
@robinhartley2627,2018-10-14T21:11:17Z,2,Loving this series - have been binge watching after googling 'can you invest in stocks with Python'. I think my question has been thoroughly answered!,True

@simonchan2394,2017-07-31T14:27:04Z,0,"Hi Sentdex, I'm trying to understand the error you made with regards to using the blaze expression in your pipeline function. Initially you imported form quantopian.interactive which gave you a blaze expression, then you fixed it with the ""from quantopian.pipeline.data.sentdex import sentiment"". Will pipeline not work with blaze expressions?",True
@BrianArbuckle,2017-07-28T04:24:57Z,3,"Great videos!    FYI it looks like the ""run_pipeline"" will get the following error in Notebook: NameError: name 'run_pipeline' is not defined.  Quantopian recommends the follow when using Notebook:  from quantopian.pipeline import Pipeline from quantopian.pipeline import CustomFactor   from quantopian.research import run_pipeline   from quantopian.pipeline.data import morningstar   from quantopian.pipeline.data.builtin import USEquityPricing  Thank you so much for sharing!",True

@panzach,2017-02-09T21:34:26Z,12,I don't know if I skipped something by accident -  but where can I see how those 'sentiments' are calculated? Thank you,True
@RatherBeCancelledThanHandled,2017-02-09T00:14:41Z,0,"Thanks for all the help uploading this and all.   But I need a little more help.   For some reason when ever I print the result dataframe I don't get either the long or short columns :/. It's so frustrating.  I see nothing different about my code vs yours.    def make_pipline():     sentiment_factor = sentiment.sentiment_signal.latest          universe= (Q1500US() & sentiment_factor.notnull())          pipe = Pipeline(columns= {'sentiment':sentiment_factor,                               'long':(sentiment_factor >= 4),                               'shorts':(sentiment_factor <=-2)},screen=universe)     return pipe  result = run_pipeline(make_pipeline(),start_date = '2015-01-01', end_date='2016-01-01')  Please let me know if there is a way I can get long and shorts in the columns.",True
