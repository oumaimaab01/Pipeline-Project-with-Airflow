@jackmiddleton2080,2020-01-07T19:04:36Z,1,"I feel like for me being a Navy Seal would be considerably easier. First of all the timescale is relatively definite. You know that if you are tough you will be a Navy Seal in such and such months. Also your hand is held by the government. You're told every process of where to go and at what time and who is your instructor. Programming is all over the place. You have no idea whether you will get a job and when and how much you will need to know. Nobody will hold your hand and tell you where to learn and how long and when you will be done. You can pay decently for a code camp I guess but you are still almost never guaranteed anything afterwards, except the guarantee of losing your money.",True

@nzshareman,2015-07-31T10:28:58Z,0,"Hi Dude I made a NZ Share market Excel workbook with Macros that down load prices for the year from Yahoo and gets Dividend Prices and Financial Earnings etc then shows all that on one sheet with PEG ratios etc, when they are found, then Takes a screen shot and saves the sheet, with the Ticker symbol so one can quickly click through the tabs and get a very quick idea on what looks good ie : Graph going up. I have trouble with websites changing things that are important like the Earnings dates, on Bloomberg it has now disappeared arh ! I find excel clunky and always having to fix it. I would like to sell my idea in a exe program as no one caters for NZ really, can you recommend a language to learn that can retrieve data from the net. Cheers Mike",True

@Aamnah,2014-05-06T11:27:04Z,0,"Hiya, thanks for the video. I'm kind of in  a similar position, looking into investing in the stock market and having a hard time finding any visual representation of data for the Pakistani market. I did find spreadsheets with historical info on share prices, but they are all spreadsheets and i don't know how to plot them into graphs so i could 'see' the performance. Google landed me at your how to graph data in python from a csv and now i'm a subscriber. Great tutorials!",True
