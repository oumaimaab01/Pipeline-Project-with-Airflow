@ValkoinenShiro,2022-03-06T21:33:50Z,3,"Just writing this and hoping it'll be useful. For the number of workers (probes), usually it's 3 per mineral patch; the number above the nexus (or townhall) can differ per game mode since the optimal ""mining"" of workers is 2 per patch with the third one mining at a lower rate. In some game modes you can have a lot of bases that can mine and since workers cost supply you may only want 2 per patch so you have enough supply for your army, but if you decide to ""tech up"" or bank a lot of ressources then going to 3 per patch is not a bad idea.  Getting the maximum amount of workers is called ""saturation"" and more than 3 workers per ressource does nothing (the gas ressource works the same for the most part, except it's almost always best to put 3 workers since gas is harder to get/has less ""patches"" to gather from).  Terrans also have mules, a temporary (timed life) mining unit that does not count against that maximum of 3 workers, but that's another thing altogether.",True
