@RealMcDudu,2016-06-29T16:24:35Z,0,"A big plus on dictionaries is that they are faster to iterate over if you're searching an item in them (compared against lists or tuples).  For example, say you have a list, a tuple and a dictionary, all holding the same values (for dictionary - the values should be keys).  The command:  "" if ___ in *** "" will take more time on list > tuple > dictionary.   I made identical arrays, and timed it ( x 100,000 times ) and it came out 0.196 for the list, 0.166 for the tuple, and 0.128 for the dictionary. This might seem like a small difference, but when you're dealing with large data - this is very noticeable (it's the difference between running a program and having it finish in 2 seconds to needing to wait a few long hours...)",True
