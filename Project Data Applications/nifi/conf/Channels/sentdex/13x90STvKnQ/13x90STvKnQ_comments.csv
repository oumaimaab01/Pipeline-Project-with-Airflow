I have learned a great deal from your videos, specifically from your pygame collection. Through your work, you have given me the beginning blocks of game design—a hobby that I can pursue with pleasure. Consider me subscribed.  Continue making more videos. ",True

@igorschmidlapp6987,2014-07-30T11:18:32Z,2,"You need to work on your presentation skills.  You ramble and drift off-point/off-slide, and you confuse or are inaccurate regarding computing concepts.  You also demonstrate a glaring inexperience in UNIX/Linux systems/user administration, shell commands, and output redirection/pipes (seriously, ""bar""?  ""Interphase""?).   The only thing I wanted out of this was the link to find the standoffs/cases, (because I saw your cluster in another video and guessed you might have a build vid on it) and I don't see a link for the hardware.  You should just reduce this entire presentation down to 1 slide listing the link to the University of Southampton or to Joshua Kiepert at Boise State.  I continued thru the series only because it was like watching a train wreck, and I was just curious to see how bad the carnage would be.  Trust me, I will not be subscribing.",True
