@TechLord79,2019-01-06T16:46:14Z,1,"You're funny, this might even be wxPython's lacking documentation fault: In (Windows) GUI programming everyone should now that a modal dialog is a blocking window; that is while the dialog window is open you are unable to interact with the program's main window. There are other ""non-modal"" dialogs or rather windows where you can work with a dialog/second window and the main window at the same time. That's why eg. .NET Form has ""Show()"" (non-modal) and ""ShowDialog()"" (modal) methods. Non-modal dialogs are used when immediate user interaction is required and the program cannot continue without it eg. selecting a file name.",True
