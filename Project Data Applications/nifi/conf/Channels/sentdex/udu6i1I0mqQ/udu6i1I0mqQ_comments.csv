@GGShinobi77,2022-04-30T18:24:35Z,0,"Nice tutorial, man!!! ü§ó I will check if you have more tutorials, with a little bit more recent software (python3 :D)",True
@roynoi4662,2021-09-21T19:22:09Z,0,"Can it be that your Inch to cm conversion->output doesn't work or you simply forgot it? Above value 9 the green and yellow LED should be high - that's another question to your video... I think, this transission is nice to have though, but you could be more precise explaining yourcode. In the last chapter, as a totally newbe, I struggled to follow with your Echos etc.. Ok, but now it's 4 years too late :). But maybe it helps others... Great tutorial though. I will dig deeper into that matter.",True
@BiologyIsHot,2021-09-05T17:40:06Z,3,I think this could possibly be newer than this tutorial but there is also GPIO.set_callback() that you can use instead of a continuous sensor loop. It runs when a value changes and minimizes CPU usage.,True

@ianstout4174,2020-08-10T20:47:03Z,0,Have you completed any raspberry pi projects where you've interfaced with the microcontroller without going into the raspberry pi interface? Or could you initiate your python programming from outside the pi interface I have seen some stuff with serial connections on arduinos just was wondering if you had done something like that at all.,True
@TXfoxie,2020-07-28T03:49:29Z,1,"I enjoy this series very much. Thank you for your great tutorial,  exceptional as always. BTW, in your pin diagram of rasberry pi GPIO header, you have 3 grounds(black), but on the breadboard, you have 4 grounds(black). Maybe you made this mistake on purpose so that we can figure out how to wire the pins. LOL. After I adjusted diagram, my lights work perfectly. Thank you a lot!",True

@navsquid32,2020-04-14T18:09:23Z,0,"Out of curiosity.... how are you choosing these resistor sizes? The typical LED draws about 20 mA for full brightness operation. The yellow and green LEDs have a forward voltage of about 3 volts, leaving 0.3V for the resistor to drop,  and if you put a 500 ohm resistor in there, you're drawing less than 1 mA of current through that LED. Realistically, the yellow and green LEDs should have a 30 ohm resistor maximum in there, which gives you 10 mA of operating current. The red LED drops about 2V, so you can use a 130 ohm resistor for that one.   The voltage divider on the ultrasonic sensor -- the only documentation I could find online says the operating current in the sensor is 15 mA. Not sure what exactly that applies to, but obviously you'd think that would dictate the resistances in the  divider. Using 1 and 2 k reduced the total current available to  1.7 mA.",True

Sir, currently I have faced a problem, actually sir I wanna access my PI from anywhere in the world without using the third¬†party application. I have googled about this but everybody is¬†talking about third party¬†application but I don't wanna use the third party application. If I use the third party application then there will have a risk for data theft. So it's my humble request to you, sir, please give me a solution.",True
@chrishellmax,2019-12-31T08:15:47Z,0,"lol. im sitting here and think wtf would you need a distance/ light combo breadboard/pi and what real world application could you use it for. THen my mind is like. Dude, reversing your car backward. Install the sensor above your licence plate, then have the lights on your dashboard telling you how close you are to the object behind you. Sweet. Now the program makes sense to me.",True

How about using a lot of the projects in your tutorials and put together an internet of things?  The video camera, GPIO for controls, etc.  You do such a good job explaining you could make a truly awesome tutorial for an IoT.  Thanks again for the tutorials you have done so far.  Love em all.
