@Gigusx,2023-04-03T14:34:22Z,0,"I was wondering how the process of writing an entire app with ChatGPT would look like so it's been interesting to watch :) I'm doing a project with the help of it but a bit more complex (it's a full-stack Vue app) and so far I've noticed a few things: - The quality of the prompts really makes a difference, a lot of the time you'll get better answers if you spend some more time on writing the prompt. I feel like I've been learning how to prompt ChatGPT better to get what I want during this experiment, but I haven't tried giving it the entire code (blocks) yet (have always assumed that the context of the conversation and what it has just given me will be enough) so I'll have to try that. - The code you get nearly always needs to be debugged, but it's still a great starting point given you understand what you got. If you don't, I imagine debugging it will be a drag. - Even more amazing for boilerplates (Vue components in my case), saves a ton of time. I haven't tried asking it to write me any tests yet so I'll have to test it out. - I often struggle with ChatGPT's character limit. In longer replies it'll cut off the message and when you ask it to continue, sometimes it'll just continue and sometimes it'll start writing new code, and even weirder - sometimes it'll write a continuation of a code it hasn't written 👀. Regenerating doesn't help a whole lot. - Also, I don't recommend regenerating WHILE it's answering, and I think it's the argument against that ChatGPT has the entire answer readily available the moment it starts replying (I've seen some good arguments in other comments as well), because if you stop generating and immediately regenerate as it's answering, it'll go really dumb and work with different information than before. Though it could be that there's something going funky when you do that and you're not supposed to do that.  All in all, I need to test it a lot more but it's been pretty fun so far. Do you think it has improved for writing code since January, if you still use it, and have you tried ChatGPT 4 yet? I'm pretty excited for the latter because I imagine I'll be able to give it a screenshot of a design and it'll spit out the entire markup, components, and logic based on it. It'll probably still require a lot of editing but damn it'll save so much time :D What they're doing with Copilot is pretty cool too!",True

But since I don't want to go through the list every time, I wanted an HTML page with ChatGPT on my homepage, where I can just ask what the HS number is for cigarettes, leather shoes, sweaters.... and it shows me that. I also have an api key from ChatGPT but I just can't get it to create such a HTML page. Since acquaintances should also benefit from my site, it should be accessible via HTML. I bought a script and it works but it's too complicated, looks good but it should be easier like here in the video. I also downloaded your script and uploaded it to the server, unfortunately it doesn't look like yoursan do not work. Does anyone have a guy for me how I can easily manage this without much knowledge?

I think the last couple of minutes of your video are very valuable and people should make a note, if not already noticed, that ChatGPT can be used to build simple applications, simple websites and that without no big knowledge from the requestor. the best part is, if you run into an error, it will provide you a solution. And this is very very helpful. You learn better like this because you get also explanation.   As example, I am in no way a programmer. Just hobby stuff and nothing big. And yet, thanks to ChatGPT we wrote together one script, then when I decided to create something similar, the errors which I was getting were very similar and i was dealing alone with them, not needed the Bot. Hence, it has quite the positives for your learning curve as well.",True

Then a discriminator learns how to rank the model output with that data and the model uses that discriminator's rankings in its loss function. Instead of tweaking prompts and modifying regexes to find and remove every edge case, this reinforcement learning process can learn to find edge cases unseen by humans.",True
