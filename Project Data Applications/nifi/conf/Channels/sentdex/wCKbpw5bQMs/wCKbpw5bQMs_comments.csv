@compacked7203,2021-03-08T20:10:58Z,0,Can I connect jumper wires to the pins for the sensor then to the breadboard with the resistor and jumper wire to the pi?,True
@sheel101,2020-11-27T03:28:50Z,0,How do I connect 4 of the HC-SRO4 sensors to my Raspberry PI? Would I just need a big breadbroad or something else?  If I'm thinking correctly I would need 8 GPIO pins and 4 1K ohm resistors,True

@rekhapandey6628,2018-06-10T11:02:18Z,0,whenever iam testing my hc-sro4 its not giving me any reply that how far is the object and then if iam clicking on my arrow keys different types of brackets are coming which I think is called bad face in technical form,True
@rekhapandey6628,2018-06-10T10:59:03Z,0,"can you please upload a clear picture of resistor and wires , because iam not able to see it clearly",True
@android-tech-nt2ko,2017-03-28T19:08:41Z,0,hello bro plizzzz you're WhatsApp,True
@ashishpatel4345,2016-07-10T22:34:09Z,0,"I did the same what you are showing here. When I use 12 (for trigger)and 16(for echo) GPIO, I got this error ""this channel is already in use continuing go"" so how to remove this error. Please let me know",True
@jayhawker03,2016-04-03T07:06:18Z,0,"I have a new issue that when I power the PI the OUT 3, and 4 spin in reverse until I run python us there a fix",True
@MsEweeee,2016-03-04T08:52:37Z,0,one question...if i wont add any resistor will raspberry be damaged ??thank you,True
@AkshayAradhya,2016-02-08T14:30:30Z,5,"I am no expert in electronics, but I have told that you should use a voltage divider. The way you have connected is  Echo 5v -----> 1k Ohm Resistor ----> GPIO Pin Adding a resistor wont reduce the voltage, only the current. So you are stll giving a 5v to the GPIO input pin which is bad.  Someone correct me if I am wrong..",True
@psc93krp,2015-12-19T11:31:10Z,0,"Why didn't you use the pins aligned vertically like a column on the breadboard? As far as I know, they can be easily use as a common GND for your circuit.",True
@Sam_A,2015-10-05T02:28:51Z,0,what resistor are you useing,True
@jeffbeck2012,2015-02-09T04:04:41Z,0,"very nice tutorial, for my project i want to use a sharp GP2Y0A21YK IR sensor, but am not sure how to write the program for it. I can set it up using a bread  board and resistor to get it woking with the pi. If you could help me with the programing part of it that would great. ",True
@SetsoTareq,2014-11-13T12:57:50Z,4,Could you Upload a picture where its better To See how u wired the resistier and the jumper on the breadboard?! Thx!,True
@ZodiacZubeda21,2014-07-26T05:56:26Z,0,How much voltage should the 1k ohm resistor have?,True
@ZodiacZubeda21,2014-07-25T01:53:41Z,0,Why did you add the resistor to the line on the breadboard for the ECHO pin? Shouldn't it go to VCC?,True
@sohummisra8969,2014-06-24T17:42:32Z,1,"can u please explain, how to control it using a phone app or browser?",True
