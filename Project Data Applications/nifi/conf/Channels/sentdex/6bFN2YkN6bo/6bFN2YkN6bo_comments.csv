@threeMetreJim,2019-08-29T01:54:28Z,0,"I wonder if it might be better to do speech to speech, i.e an impersonator.  You might then be able to use a not very good text to speech and have it 'corrected' by the neural network.  Would be a lot better for faking a phone call too, no need to type your reply if you could feed it with your own voice - wouldn't be able to listen to it at the same time though, if it's changing the intonation and pitch (you'd need a speech to text so you could see what was being said), it's bad enough trying that with a 'dumb' voice changer. I still think the source - filter model is probably the best way to generate high fidelity speech; less data throughput and more processing power nowadays for many more parameters and could easily be controlled by a neural network - might be a good for using a GAN on too.",True

By that I mean that every instrument recorded on songs from 2000 onwards is lined up to a 16th note. It makes it easier to shuffle sounds about and you only need one small sample. Autotune tries to match  every note the singer makes to a scale note in the key of the song if it is slightly off. Adam Levine?  The BPM remains constant over the whole song and the sound is compressed to feck. An old music teacher told me that the most important parts of music are the silences between notes. Your voice simulations sound pretty good. The nuances , silences, changes in timbre and inflection are what is missing. Perhaps the machine learning is concentrating on the wrong part of vocalisation. Then again. I could just be talking shi*e. :-)",True

@mikerhinos,2019-07-12T18:09:28Z,0,"Damn it sounds really good... In my job I have to make some motion designs / funny cartoons for some digital learning modules, and honestly, real voices costs too much because each single change to a word means a complete redo of the audio capture...TTS is limited because it sounds pretty robotic, and you have only a few voices available for ALL of your works... So we ""just"" have to train the base model with around 200 audio samples of 2-10s with its transcription ?  (My english isn't perfect but that's what I understood).",True
