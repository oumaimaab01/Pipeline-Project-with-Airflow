@Julian-ph5jp,2020-08-03T21:46:33Z,0,I know im late but for anyone who is interested. The high accuracy is due to a problem of high correlation between label and Adj. Close which is include as one of the features. basically we are using previous values of our label as an explicative variable. u cant do that in linear regression. u cant use AR models here. So i recommend to drop Adj. Close of your features then u¬¥ll see that the accuary goes down.,True

However, since he is not using Python, I am following this series to understand the implementation in python. Combining both of these courses is a very deadly combination.

I would just like to point out for those just tickling the subject, the high accuracy output from this model is rather misleading (no flame intended on the content creator, I actually do admire your work and want you to keep making these amazing videos!). The problem occurs when the data is scaled. In practice when you scale training and validation sets together you are introducing a huge bias into your training set from your validation set due to the way the data is scaled. It is as if, when you scale data that way, your training set gets a huge ""peek"" into the future thus resulting on the obscenely high accuracies observed. Just food for thought. Anyway. Great video!

@RealMcDudu,2016-06-13T09:05:56Z,88,"I think the problem of getting high ""accuracy"" (=R^2 coefficient) with using this Linear Regression Model on our data, is due to the fact our label data spans from quite a low number (~50) to quite a high number (~800) and has a very high variance in itself (even for a shuffled test set). It just so happens that stock prices tend to stay in the vicinity of what it used to be - even 30 days after/ago (unless some really crazy things happened and the stock flies up or plunges). So our model variance (Sum of Squared Errors) would be relatively small (compared with the overall label variance).   So actually our model is not that great, but when calculating the R^2 coefficient which is the ""accuracy"" - the overall variance of our label-data is so great compared with the model variance, that we get a ""good accuracy"".   If we take, say - only the last 110 days, shift 10, so we have 100 features values, and 100 labels, train it on 80 and test it on 20 - we will get (unsurprisingly) really bad results (when I ran this R^2/Accuracy ~ 0).",True
