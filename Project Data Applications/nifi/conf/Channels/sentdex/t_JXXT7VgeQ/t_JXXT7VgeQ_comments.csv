@Theophilusbraimah,2018-04-09T08:56:51Z,0,"Please, how do I write a Python program that asks the user for the information from part 1(stock data) and performs exponential smoothing based on it? The program should have the ability to allow the user to input alpha, display the graph of the original data and the “smoothed data” and have the user verify if this model is appropriate. If it is not then it should loop asking for new entries for alpha until the user indicates the model is appropriate.",True
@umutalihandikel5490,2017-03-29T20:16:20Z,0,"hey, thanks for videos!!  I try to use this func for my analysis.  But I think my results weights the initial values more, rather then the latest ones...  The reason for the might be the format of my data source. Since Google takes the latest data in last row of csv, Yahoo takes the lates data in the first row.   I see that your function is suitable for Yahoo. I use Google Fin as my data source. Thus I need to turn your function revers.. How do I do that? Any ideas? Please help! :)",True

I ran into a weird issue a couple of videos back, but just ignored it, but the problem persists.  It seems as if I can run this program with any stock, as long as I downloaded the data using the first program we wrote, except for 'GOOG'. The data looks the same to me, but I keep getting this error, which is caught by our main try/except loop: 'Failed main loop x and y must have same first dimension.'  This only happens, I think, with google.",True
