@ketan_sahu,2020-06-10T19:50:09Z,0,"In case someone wants to know how to redirect to the same page where the user has made the login request, here's a way:  {% extends 'base_layout.html' %}  {% block content %} 	<h1>Login</h1> 	<form class=""site-form"" action=""{% url 'accounts:login' %}"" method=""post""> 		{% csrf_token %} 		{{ form }} 		{% if request.GET.next %} 			<input type=""hidden"" name=""next"" value=""{{ request.GET.next }}""> 		{% endif %} 		<input type=""submit"" value=""Login""> 	</form> {% endblock %}  in the login form, we are checking if there is a ""next"" attribute in the request (if a request comes from any page then the link to that page is stored in the ""next"" variable). If yes then we send it along in the post request made to log in as above. and then in the view, we do the following:  def login_view(request): 	if request.method == 'POST': 		form = AuthenticationForm(data=request.POST) 		if form.is_valid(): 			user = form.get_user() 			login(request, user) 			if 'next' in request.POST: 				return redirect(request.POST.get('next')) 			else: 				return redirect('articles:list') 	else: 		form = AuthenticationForm() 	return render(request, 'accounts/login.html', { 'form': form })  we check if there is a ""next"" attribute in the POST request and the user is authenticated then we the user in and redirect him/her to the link stored in the ""next"".",True

@user-hl1fk6lw8k,2019-07-05T04:13:45Z,0,"This is interesting and pellucid tutorial. Awesome!!!  But a tiny problem with navbar did occur: navbar should be dynamic when a user registers/logs in an account thus repetitive ""register""/""login"" should disappear(otherwise the corresponding url becomes /register/register), leaving only either ""login"" or ""register"".   Since my navbar does not know whether I am on register page or login page (or it does just not that I know of), I had to copy and paste the header.html to both register.html and login.html, before toggling the <nav></nav> interchangeably. Is there a way to achieve this through full utilization of Jinja templating?",True
