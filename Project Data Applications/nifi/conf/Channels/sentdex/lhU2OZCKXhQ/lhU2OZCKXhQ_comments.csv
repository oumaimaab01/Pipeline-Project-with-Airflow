@michaelbrown2629,2018-09-13T07:30:02Z,0,"Hi Sentdex, I work in a lab that generates a lot of spectral  data (each file can consist of 15 different columns about 4000 lines long of numerical values). There can be many parameters for each file (metal, number of laser pulses, energy used, date, user, etc.) I am thinking of building a database and using python to filter the data and display the results in various plots. I have python experience but only a tiny amount with SQL. I'm just curious if you have experience doing this with a database that would grow over time and if there is a preference between SQL, MySQL, and SQLite.",True
