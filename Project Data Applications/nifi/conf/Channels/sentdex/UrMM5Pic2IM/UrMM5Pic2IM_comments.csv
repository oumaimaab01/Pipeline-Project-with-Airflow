@idaniamairena4191,2023-08-14T12:39:35Z,0,Installed it myself without any issues. The wifi signal is great even https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxE_D_sddGAdiVUKp7PkkmyxO7bRtgqmk5 when the router is located far away. I really enjoy the night vision feature that allows me to see clearly any activity near our house (mostly cars and wild animals). The motion detection is helpful to me as well to monitor what happens on our front.,True

@bearclawws,2019-10-22T03:26:07Z,0,"Hi Sentdex. I have a property about 20 miles out of town , but live in my home in the city. It has such an amazing view that I have constant trespassers that leave trash. I am not able to be out there policing it everyday. I have looked but found your channel and thought you might know more than me on a security cam system I might be able to put in out there that where I could monitor the camera from my house in the city or on the go with my phone. Any ideas? I would like it to be able to record on motion but also be able to view through it 24/7 and possibly be able to remote record if i see something . The property is off the grid and I currently have no electricity out there yet, but when I do I could go electric security but would be more interested in solar. thanks for any info. I sub'd! :)",True
@klenovicaklen657,2019-10-09T18:20:16Z,0,"I like Reolink, bought for $99, hooked up over the POE. After a year it lost one of the color components, but it still works decent. Wish they come up with thinner cable, as I had to drill wider hole in concreate house overseas. Now, it's been working constnatly for a year and half. I do get lot of false emails, it's challenging to find right sensitivity and not too miss 'bad neighbours'.",True

@wallboy28,2019-04-24T19:16:08Z,0,"I have 4 Reolink cameras and they are shit. Very good quality WHEN they work but mine constantly disconnect and will only re-connect by removing from the house and having to connect via Ethernet. The firmware will also not update on any of the cameras. Reolink customer support is extremely slow and pretty much useless. They even offered me 8% discount on 2 of my cameras for the issue I am facing. I would rather the cameras actually properly work than have a discount.  I do NOT recommend Reolink at all.",True
