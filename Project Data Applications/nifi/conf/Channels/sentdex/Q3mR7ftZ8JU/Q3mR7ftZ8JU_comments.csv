Now coming to the point I wish to connect nvidia 1070ti GPU to macbook pro 2012. The issue is I have pci-e mini v8 beast with x16 to connect the graphic card. Is it possible to directly connect one end of HDMI cable to v8 beast and the other end of HDMI cable to thunderbolt 2 converter and input it to macbook? Will this work as thunderbolt 2 port is nothing but an external pci??  I have no budget to purchase prebuilt chassis for gpu to thunderbolt conversion. If the chassis is necessary at any cost can I build it on my own?  pci-e beast v8 has a HDMI port to transfer data. The other end of this HDMI cable is pci 1x. I wish to use this[1] .

@lhtd,2016-11-27T01:00:36Z,0,"Hey man !! Concerning the camera, as tons of people said, it's the lights and there are several ways of fixing it until you find one you like:  a) Dim the lights to make them more glossy and avoid those white reflections, thus lowering the contrast. You can use a sheet of paper or some cotton tissues like a t-shirt.  b) Make light more homogenous to diminish the contrast : Add a light source of light on your left. c) the space behind you has a very nice depth, but as the source of light is on one side, it is a green scale from bright to light. You can test recording on a more flat and homogeneous background. Test on a laptop and just sit with a wall flat behind you and you and you'll see what i mean.  For linux, probably the flickering things and maybe the delays come from the window managers. Try out some other window managers which might do the trick: XFCE, Mate, gnome, KDE or if you re feeling beautiful techy and adventurous, enlightment. You can install them from synaptic package manager or from your terminal. You can switch between any of them when you login into your session, there will be a small icon nearby your username. Click on it and switch from one to the other. My favourite ones are XFCE, mate and enlightment. They are quite good to manage different screens. My maximum has been 3, one of which was copy from one of my screens. Give it a shot, it should take you about 10 min to try.  Thanks for showing your computer, your experience is really appreciated.
