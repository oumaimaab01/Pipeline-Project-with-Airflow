@abilovestotrade,2018-02-19T05:00:24Z,0,"This is very basic, this tutorial doesn't even tells the users that you can import the .ui file into your python code. And doing it will help you a LOT. The way sentdex has explained, if you do the design and then convert the design into python code then you are back at square one in case you have to change the design for any reason. As any programmer knows that your program keeps improving over the course of time, so the change is inevitable. In my opinion importing the .ui file and then using codes to connect those buttons will give you the flexibility to change the design as and when you want without having to change your code. Now I am new to python that's why I am on this video. I came here to learn how to do make windows in windows, how to hide a certain labels and text inputs until they are called for, etc, etc. More deeper stuffs. Sadly sentdex only does tutorials based on the basic documentation. No depth at all.",True
@carlfranz6805,2018-02-12T21:27:18Z,0,"I think I understand why 'sentdex' stopped at this point.  Tha man isn't a masochist.  Without bunches of trial and error, the QtDesigner is a real pain for anything other than really simple layouts.  Even trying it for the simple text editor we were playing with had my teeth grinding and my eyes rolling.    For more fun, try laying a border around a grid sometime. Anyone figured out how to make a thicker line using the Horizontal and Vertical Lines.  Haven't played with the spacers yet to see if they are easier to muck about with.  Also, I especially enjoy the fact that you cannot clearly see where the tool and status boxes are when starting with the MainWindow.  Another note.  When using the *(&^* layouts, especially the *(&^* grid layout....  its much easier to drop the various widgets on the screen in some sort of row/column layout and then drop the layout over them.   I fact, I'm not sure there is any other way to create a grid layout in the QtDesigner.  If anyone has experience with this, please chime in.  ** For Windows users, if you want to avoid all that typing to execute the 'pyuic4.bat' converter program put the following into a batch file ('QtGen.bat' for instance): c:\python36\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\pyuic4.bat -x %1.ui -o %1.py  thus: 'QtGen myui' will take 'myui.ui' and create 'myui.py'.   Remember to change the 'python36' to whatever the Python root directory is for the version you're using.  Good luck everyone.  Let's help each other out.",True

How does one go back and forth in real development between visual code generation and manual coding?  If I add functionality in the Python code generated from the ui then every time I change the ui I will have a crazy amount of work to do.  Maybe I am supposed to import the form and do all my coding in a separate project, but how does a button pressed in the form raise an event in my Python event handler?

As such, would you think it possible to do a video to show the following VERY program that (its no issue for me writing this in IDLE with no GUI btw)  1) Request the users name 2) Asks the user to add too random numbers (1-5) 3) Allows the user to answer 4) Repeat 5 times 5) Displays the number of questions asked 6) Displays the number correctly answered  I am really interested in making the interface functional.
