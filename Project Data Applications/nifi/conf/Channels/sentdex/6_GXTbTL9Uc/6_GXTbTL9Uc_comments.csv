We as the community see you as kind of legendary god conquering every possible challenge which is put there.  Looking at how you work and master the problem in a humble way is just great. You mention your overall plan and just start off, fix problems/errors and point out just all the little things that go wrong as it is the most common thing possible. Even stating ""well, maybe I'm just not good at it"" while you actually just started tinkering with the framework.  Harrison, we love you. Thanks for providing all the content over so many years.
