If i have a distance matrix (distance between two nodes and diagonal is zero ), so i need to cluster these data ( any number of cluster) so how can i apply K Mean cluster algorithm in python ?

@JohanSebastianCorn,2017-12-20T05:22:16Z,0,"when i heard 'euclidean distance', i was scared. then realized it was middle school math... just never gave a shets about the name.  for the people who don't understand what I'm talking about...which is a bit sad... euclidean distance is finding the hypotenuse of a triangle. well... only when it is two dimensional and three. beyond four is a whole new ball game :D",True
@PedroLucas-hk3vo,2017-11-30T18:33:33Z,0,"A simple way for youngsters to understand this formula is to think about the Pythagorean theorem and how (for 2D, lets keep it simple) you can translate your entire X/Y axis so that O (0,0) matches one of your points.  For distance purposes it is irrelevant where your Origin is. So now, If you have two points P1 and P2, and P1 matches the origin, what's the distance to P2 ? You know how to calculate it, using a^2+b^2=c^2.  a is the X coordinate of P2. b is the Y coordinate of P2. c is the distance from P1 to P2 (the hypotenuse ) So... c=sqrt(a^2+b^2) = sqrt ( (a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2).  See the zeroes ? That's the P1 coordinates,. There you have it, Euclid and Pythagoras working together :)",True
