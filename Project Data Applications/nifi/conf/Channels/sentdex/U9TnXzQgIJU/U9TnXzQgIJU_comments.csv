@MiledRizk,2016-03-15T15:24:21Z,4,"thanks again for these good tutorials: i modified a little the script so i can click without dragging and create straight lines, and if i want i can start dragging  and i'll have a freeform shape, so i'll end up with a mixed shape. Of course it still lots of work to make it more useful, because now after finishing the dragging i cannot start a new independent shape. Anyway here's my code: from kivy.app import App from kivy.uix.widget import Widget from kivy.graphics import Line   class Drawapp(Widget):     def __init__(self, **kwargs):         super(Drawapp, self).__init__(**kwargs)         self.arr = []      def on_touch_down(self, touch):         with self.canvas:             touch.ud[""polyline""] = Line(points=(touch.x, touch.y))             self.arr.append((touch.x, touch.y))             if len(self.arr) <= 2:                 for idx in range(len(self.arr)):                     touch.ud[""polyline""].points += self.arr[idx]             else:                 for idx in range(len(self.arr)):                     touch.ud[""polyline""].points += self.arr[-2]      def on_touch_move(self, touch):         touch.ud[""polyline""].points += (touch.x, touch.y)               def on_touch_up(self, touch):         self.arr.append((touch.x, touch.y))  class SimpleApp5(App):     def build(self):         return Drawapp()  if __name__ == ""__main__"":     SimpleApp5().run()",True
