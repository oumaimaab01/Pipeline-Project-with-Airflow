@clearthinking5441,2020-03-28T11:10:20Z,1,"Hi Harrison, I am a great fan of your work. However, I think this introduction to classes is not very good. It would be better if you gave a clearer outline at the beginning as to what classes are actually used for. Also keywords (instance, method, object, attributes) are used too quickly without a proper explanation as to what they mean (this is an intro!). I get that you are trying to use an example to illustrate how classes are used but you don't even explain at the beginning what you want Blob object to actually do!",True

@ryanrowland,2016-12-01T19:11:01Z,0,"I'm new to Python, I started learning about 3 weeks ago.  I've written several basic apps using skills I picked up from your basics series for which I'm not sure what the correct term is (Procedural? I basically just tell it what I want it to do in order of when I want it to do it, while also defining functions to avoid repeating code) without much trouble. I actually felt pretty confident that I was picking it up pretty quickly as doing it that way all seemed fairly logical to me.  However, I have just finished watching this tutorial series and by the end of the OOP stuff I feel like my brain as melted and that it all just went in one ear and out the other - it just didn't click like everything else seemed to.  What would you suggest would be the best way to try and get my head around OOP?",True
