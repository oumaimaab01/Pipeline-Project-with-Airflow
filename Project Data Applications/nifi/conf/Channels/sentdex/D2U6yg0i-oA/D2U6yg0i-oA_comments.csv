@soonfamous,2016-06-14T18:05:36Z,42,"Quick help for everyone. statistics module is preinstalled with Python 3, in case you dont have it go ahead and ""pip install statistics"" in the command line. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, do not name your file statistics since the import will be confused and throw the errors of the library not existing and the mean function not existing. If you have done this already just go to your folder where you saved the file, and delete it. An other option is to Save As, with an other name but then dont forget to set the configurator (the python symbol up right) to have the new script you are using. Hope it helps and once again thank you sentdex for this great series!",True
