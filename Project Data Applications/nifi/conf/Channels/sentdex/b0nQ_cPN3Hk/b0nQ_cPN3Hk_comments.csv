@excaliburstify,2015-10-01T18:07:49Z,0,"Hi Sentdex,  Thank you for the great inspiration for technical analysis of stocks.  I have run into a problem with the Quandl grab...  It seems the lines for grabbing the csv files from Quandl (situated just below 'try' under 'endlink' are outdated.  I have updated them as follows, but they still fail, so I get no data:  netIncome = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/RAYMOND/'+stock.upper()+'_NET_INCOME_A.csv?'+endLink).read()  revenue = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/RAYMOND/'+stock.upper()+'_REVENUE_A.csv?'+endLink).read()  ROC = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/DMDRN/'+stock.upper()+'_ROC.csv?'+endLink).read()  would anyone care to enlighten us on what the trouble might be?  Thanks Morten",True
