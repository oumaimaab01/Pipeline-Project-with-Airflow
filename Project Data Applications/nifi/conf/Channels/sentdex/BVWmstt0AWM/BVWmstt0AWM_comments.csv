Maybe cut another narrow piece to use the full width and maybe some joining brackets or other hardware on the bottom, so it is one joined piece of wood and just paint it black. I say this because a full-depth self would have to start at 1U and you're getting a little extra space doing it the way you have here. And also, there were not many full-depth shelves available at decent prices, and a sturdy one would be expensive.

Secondly, don't put patch panels between two switches, that's just make the ports on the rear of the panel hard to see and reach.

Those monitors are also rack mounted because the control tv room also have many racks, but I'm not sure that those racks has the same width of network racks, so they probably won't fit.",True

@nikk.1752,2022-07-02T01:43:36Z,23,"What I came up with in 2 years of using server rack at home:  1) UPS is not needed in my case. I lived in an old house with bad wiring, so I immediately attended to this issue and spent a lot on it. They are very expensive, and supplying only two GPU farms would cost more than the cost of the rack itself, and the batteries need to be changed every few years. As a result, I extended a separate power line from the electricity meter with it's own RCD and installed a voltage stabiliser + do checkpoints more often  2) extra shelves clogged with the wrong stuff  3) sitting at the rack is not very convenient, each time pushing-pulling out the periphery tires. If space permits, it is better to put a compact table nearby. It's not as aesthetically pleasing, but much more convenient.  4) It is better not to put a 3D printer on a server rack. Rack is not super solid, nor is the shelf, and the 3D printer can produce vibrations. The difference in print quality on the floor vs rack is small, but noticeable  5) ground the rack and cases, less dust will accumulate :)",True

@prashanthb6521,2022-07-01T19:14:08Z,2,What is the total power consumption of entire rack ? I put a sticker on each machine mentioning how much a current it sucks at idle. And an ammeter at the rack top displaying the current in amperes. I will know when a machine goes bad it starts sucking more power. Or at least I will know when there is action taking place :),True
@adrianteri,2022-07-01T19:00:32Z,0,"Next will be to address a capable UPS able to handle 75% of your peak load without breaking a sweat otherwise during an interruption some will suck up too much resulting in boot loops. Also depends on how long you want your systems to run in an outage. Some automatons for graceful shutdowns and monitoring. Lastly, on networking I didn't see anything about a proper router/firewall ..Maybe you don't have a need for segmenting your network? Maybe you don't access you devices away from home? Or you don't have devices on your network that you'd consider untrustworthy or risky?",True
@djreynolds922,2022-07-01T18:58:32Z,4,"I threw my 3D Printer in my Rack - hugely recommend. Some LED Strips when it's on and it turns into a center piece for it. I also have an open frame and instead of an actual monitor rack like you went with, I just use a simple Monitor arm that's off to the side clamped onto the shelving I used for the 3D Printer - allows me to reposition it when I'm working on something else on my workbench which is right next to it - very similar to your setup.",True
