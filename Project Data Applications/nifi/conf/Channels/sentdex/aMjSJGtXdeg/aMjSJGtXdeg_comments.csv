@freefood,2018-10-28T06:13:46Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, I love your videos. So i wanted to follow along to the tutorial and maybe somewhat change up the codes with my preferences. However I noticed in the rules that We can't copy code from anywhere ? Official rule:  ""You are expected to write original code for Halite III. Plagiarism is not tolerated. You are permitted to use any code found in official documentation, tutorials, and starter kits from the Halite III repository. But if you submit code written by another Halite player (even if it has been posted publicly), your account may be deleted from the leaderboard and/or banned.""  Should i be worried ?",True

@FrancisManojFernando,2018-10-24T04:53:28Z,0,"Thanks sentdex for inspiration. I made a somewhat good bot after seeing your first video.  Few tips: after making a bot do a version number and run the old version against the new bot. ""Python Mybot"" ""Python oldbot"" and you can have 4v4 as well just put extra arguments. Hope it helps",True

@toastrecon,2018-10-23T14:13:44Z,0,"I haven't caught up with all of these, but I think you mentioned that there was a time limit that you were allowed for your bot to send commands or play its turn. Is there a way to see how close you're getting to that limit? The rule-based bot probably wouldn't be too bad.",True
