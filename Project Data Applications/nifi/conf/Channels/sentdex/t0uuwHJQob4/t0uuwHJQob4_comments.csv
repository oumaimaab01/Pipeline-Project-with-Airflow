@Sabre00,2013-10-24T08:54:01Z,0,"To get rid of that warning, at the end of your script you can put ""gpio.cleanup ()"". This will revert all the pins to their normal state.  That warning occurs when you address a pin that has been previously addressed (so to speak). Its difficult to put it in a while True type loop as that command will basically resets all the configurations.  The other setmode type is ""gpio.setmode (gpio.BOARD)"".",True
