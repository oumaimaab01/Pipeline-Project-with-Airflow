I also think that when the data consist of just lines, weights of miscalculation lines in the network will be easily decreased. I mean they are finally ineffective to the output. thanks.",True

@etopowertwon,2018-12-03T17:22:20Z,0,"Hm. Looking back at my driving, it seems NN will pick up bad manners: when I was driving uphill on that same road segment  as you are, first several attempts near the cottage at the start I drove at the center of the lane or on the outer side of the road, which is very slow(thus providing a lot of data points). During the last attempts I've figured out that coming near center of the road, to the left part of the lane is much quicker, thus providing fewer data points. My future self should probably record data it to several files so data can be discarded selectively.  Also I've just used `if 'Q' in keys: break` to stop recording instead of alt-tab, ctrl-c.",True
@alexsavu7261,2018-11-14T09:20:24Z,9,"I know this is old but, as someone else mentioned, if you did  if 'A' in keys:     output[0] = 1 if 'D' in keys:     output[2] =  1 if 'W' in keys:     output[1] = 1 instead of doing the if, elif, else, then you would have the combinations of those buttons too.

Also, it seems quite new so it may not have been available at the time of recording but there is a python module calle mss which allowed me to get screen grabs at 60 FPS (if i drew the screen grabs back to the screen using cv2.imshow i got around 25-30 FPS)",True

@nixellion,2017-10-26T13:56:57Z,0,"Is there a way to record mouse movement from a game in python? win32api GetCursorPosition returns x,y coordinates of the mouse, and in game if you move you mouse infinitely to the left and up, it will rotate the camera, but cursor will just get to 0,0 and stay there, and that's what pyautogui and GetCursorPosition return. In games it's more like offset.  So, is there a way to record this data? I actually don't think that it's a good idea to try and let neural network learn how to control a mouse in a 3d shooter game, lol, but who knows! For science! I wanna try to play for a few hours, record both keyboard and mouse actions, and see if CNN can figure out how to play a game :D The only thing stopping me right now is how to get mouse movement.",True
