@Edeljokaa,2018-03-04T17:26:43Z,3,@sentdex I just started following this tutorial. One thing you probably already know is that url() is no longer included. Instead you can use re_path() for regexs and path() for strings. For other noobs this might be a notification to include in the video. Also Bootstrap 4.0 has been released a couple of months ago and they changed some classes that are part of your header.html so unless you tell people to explicitly download 3.3.7 they will end up with a broken (or at least much less working) site. Maybe this should be updated on pythonprogramming.net because many commenters seem to have this problem. Other than that I really enjoy this series so far. Usually I end up working with PHP for websites (that's why I'm quite familiar with Bootstrap) but I've always enjoyed Python ever since we learned it in school. But back then I would have never guessed how much Python is capable of. Thank you for showing me!,True

After watching this series I feel empowered, I really get it. Thank you for doing an awesome job. I can't wait for the next one. Subscribed!",True
@EscapeePrisoner,2016-01-26T15:23:32Z,4,"I have not looked fully at all your other tutorials but I gather you've been doing this for a while. Thank you for that. Lesson sizes are great. The only problem as far as I see it is you can't make them fast enough. I hope the people who wrote the official Django Tutorial take notice, because I think your way eases people in much nicer. Django has a lot of moving parts and I've found it very hard to grasp starting from the DB side of things. You're doing good stuff and I hope the rewards are what you had hoped. Remain Awesome.",True
