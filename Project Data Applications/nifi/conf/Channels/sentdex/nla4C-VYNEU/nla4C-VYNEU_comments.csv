@RealMcDudu,2016-06-04T16:47:08Z,0,"A question: given the features that you chose why is there any difference between the ""regular"" Naive Bayes, the multinomial one, and the Bernoulli one? Since you only choose a subset of 3000 common words, and from them you just ask - did they appear (once or more) =1 or didn't appear (at all) = 0 - this seems basically like a Bernoulli naive-bayes. A multinomial NB would actually count the frequency of each word and take that into account. I don't understand how there can be different results???  Update: from what I could understand from the nltk documentation, it seems like it is a multinomial Naive Bayes, but again - I still don't understand why would it have any effect if the features are all ready ""bernoulli-zed""",True
