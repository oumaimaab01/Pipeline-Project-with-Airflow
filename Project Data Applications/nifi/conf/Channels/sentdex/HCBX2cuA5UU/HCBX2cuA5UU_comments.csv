@rohithgm1,2017-05-11T09:06:15Z,2,"Hi,  Its been a pleasure to follow your tutorials. Really appreciate the whole machine learning series. I started of with 0 knowledge of python and almost 0 knowledge of machine learning, Reached this point in less than a month.  Just a quick question:- (I ran this model which got trained for random data for 1000 games and took all the data above 100 score and retrained) * 5, with each time adding the data to the original set and shuffling and retraining.   When I tested the model it gets score 200 and it returns done as true. Is this the environment itself when the score reaches 200 it stops?  Cause I saw a different comment stating  ""other times the game just ends while the pole seems to be quite straight, might just be too many fps to catch it falling over quickly sometimes..."" The same is happening..pole is very straight and the cart balances well but still the game stops In my case I ran the model 10 times and these are my scores:- 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 200.0 Average Score: 200.0 Choice1: 0.4985, Choice2: 0.5015  So I am pretty sure that the game is stopping once the score reaches 200. Is this the case with you also, cause in the tutorial you reached scores of 300",True

@juleswombat5309,2017-05-01T11:37:07Z,0,"Yeah well that was pretty awesome result. cudos. I got an average score fo 200.0 (194.6 over 25 games) !  So I guess this is really a classic control theory problem (balancing a broomstick), and what we have used batch Neural network to discover and optimise the control laws State => Action, a sort of direct Policy model, directly in a large batch NN model. Which is pretty neat, but its not the same approach as iterative Q(S,A) learning typically suggested in  Game path finding via DQN.   It would be nide to see if this approach works with the Open Gym Walking biped scenarios, or whether we have to use a Q learner, with perhaps a NN Q Approximator (aka DQN) instead.",True
@ryanshrott9622,2017-04-25T20:35:16Z,11,"Is this a correct general summary?  1. Let the machine play 10,000 games. 2. Gather input feature space (previous observation) and output data (action) only from the subset of games which performed 'well'.  3. Train a neural network to predict an action based on an input feature space.  4. Play the game by taking actions based on the current input feature space.",True
@Sauerbier_,2017-04-21T16:22:56Z,2,ok wait i think i missunderstood the whole training concept. Isn't the goal to achive the highest accuracy as possible without overfitting? So how did you know your network was already overfitted with only aprox. 60% accuracy? And how do i know when i should stop training?,True
