For example, there's csv-plot (both an online version, and a python version Manu NALEPA nalepae/csv-plot )..   Or plotjuggler /  matplotlib ?   YMT-Lab csv-graph-viewer uses pyqtgraph which seems perfect, but for such a common application I'm hoping to find something that already exists for what I need.",True
