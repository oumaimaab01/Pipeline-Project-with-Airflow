@ephraimmotho887,2022-06-02T05:19:19Z,0,"While x =0, x is not greater than 5, so it hits the first else statement. x+=1 is the same as x = x+1 therefore the new value of x is 1(0+1=1). The while loop continues going until x =6 (the first number greater than 5). Before he put in the 'break' this condition would have continued to be true forever (and code would not have moved on to the first 'else' BECAUSE THE WHILE CONDITION IS TRUE) hence the first infinite loop.  After 'break' inserted, as soon as x=6, we broke out of the while loop, hence we only printed one statement. Once x+=11 (second else statement), the while condition is not triggered (because 0+11 = 11 and that is not less than ten) hence we printed second 'else' statement",True

@diamondDog_629,2018-08-05T18:31:25Z,1,"I'm just learning python and I was wondering why does 'while' need an 'else' when the 'else' always runs irrespective of whether we ran the while loop or not, but I didn't think the 'break' statement would make a difference . Thank you for making it clear.",True
