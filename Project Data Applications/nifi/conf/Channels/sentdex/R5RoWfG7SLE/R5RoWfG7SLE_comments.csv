@JeanPierreSchnyder,2018-08-02T20:24:07Z,0,"Isn't it unfair that I win with roll from 51 to 99 (means a probality of 49 %) while the otther side has 1 to 50 (means a probability of 50 %) ? I would split the roll as 1 to 50, 51 to 100 and 101 to 101, using roll = random(1, 101) !",True
@MrAlivallo,2017-06-05T17:36:50Z,1,"you make a great point at the end of the Vid;   GAME Developers take note:  look up the RAND combo success % of Street Fighter 5;  there is a whole debate on developers making their games Easy and Random, Skilled and Random, Easy and Predictable, Skilled and Predictable.   Examples are:    Tetris, Chess, Roulette, bejewled, angry birds...   make the skilled pro players happy and and the Noobs will not play.  No Noobs = no sponsorship.    Chris Moneymaker...  turns a WPT million dollar profit;  and writes a series of profitable books...while he was later evaluated as using THE worst poker strategy plays of any WPT player to date.  Also on the opposite end of this is...Helmuth. nuff said.",True
@MrAlivallo,2017-06-05T17:23:05Z,1,"I took some programming classes in college (SQL, PHP, Java) and after months of study I could hardly create a simple VB calculator. Or nested SELECT statement;  no less get it to work with PHP on a hosting platform.    1 hour of this video and some online Python games and i'm closer than I have ever been to ""Functional Programming"" then ever.   But in all honesty,  I wonder how many watching these vids actually want to create an app because they don't have DEVelopment money.  Please introduce a video on Turn-key app development !   and possibly one on hiring developers to finish complicated tasks to keep costs down like 'Odesk'.",True

@mfasco84,2015-01-01T13:01:46Z,0,"Great stuff! Thanks for the awesome materials you load on the channel. Now, I've tried to replicate your code and, with simple_bettor, I've got different results. After a bit of checking, it turns out that my implementation of roll dice is different: I've simply used ""return random.randint(1,100) % 2 == 0"" so it gives 50/50 opportunity. Your code seems to give 48/52. Am I wrong? Thanks a lot!",True
