@ggsuicided,2018-07-21T00:23:02Z,44,"Hi Sentdex! Just letting you know if you print a good amount of comments, you're eventually bound to hit an error with encoding - because people use emojis and whatnot, however rarely.  When printing comment.body, I ended up replacing it with ""print(comment.body.encode(""utf-8"", errors='ignore'))"".  Hope this helps anyone with the same error!",True
@charimuvilla8693,2018-06-10T00:58:57Z,14,"Hello nice tutorial! I figured out the error you got.   *submission.comments.replace_more()* applies changes directly, it doesn't return the result (it returns a list of MoreComments instances that were not replaced, that's why you got the error, you called .list() on a list). You accidentally assigned this to ""comments"" and confusion started. *submission.comments.list()* returns a list with the Comment instances (you can't call .replace_more() on that it's just a regular list)  So the right way to do it would be this:  submission.comments.replace_more() comments = submission.comments.list() And now you have your list.  As a final note help(submission.comments) gave me all the info to solve this. help() is like dir() but also gives you tons of info",True
