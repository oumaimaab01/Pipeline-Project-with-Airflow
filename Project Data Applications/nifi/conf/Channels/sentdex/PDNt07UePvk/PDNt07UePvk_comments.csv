@draakisback,2021-11-13T19:30:44Z,24,"Yeah, been extremely unimpressed with copilot and now admittedly I have mainly attempted to use it with elixir and rust code.  With elixir code, it suggests nothing but Ruby with small modifications to fit the elixir syntax.  Most of the expressions will not even be valid.  I know elixir is not an expressly supported language but you'd think a tool like this could see the context of the file extension.    For rust code the issues are much more subtle but still problematic.  Since I work in the crypto space, much of what I do  is very abstract, copilot has a ton of trouble parsing very abstract code.  And in regards to statically typed languages it's almost like copilot makes up its own types like 20-30% of the time.  This is especially true for macro derived types.     This tool isn't going to take anyone's job any time soon.  And it has problems with licensing in the open source community.  It's difficult to know if the code it's pulling in is something that it figured out on its own or something that it basically copied from another repo and worse still, it doesn't really respect licences so the code could get you into trouble.    I also would never use this tool when writing proprietary code since it's hard to know where your code is being broadcasted.  If you use this to write a secure algorithm then you should be extremely careful.  I am also worried that this will further dumb down the next generation of coders.  It's already the case that developers will learn frameworks and not the underlying concepts so that they can get a job really easily. The problem with this approach though is that these developers won't be able to do anything non-trivial outside of the scope of the framework (there are plenty of JS devs who don't know vanilla JS for example). Co-pilot feels a bit like that;  If all you're doing to write code is writing comments, how do you gain a deeper understanding of the code that's being outputted.  And I think that's really where us developers are going to be with tools like this emerging.  We will always be necessary in some capacity, because even if they create more complex versions of copilot which can build out entire apps with ease, a developer is still going to have to be there to make sure the code is consistent and workable.  Also, software is not math or science; there are multiple ways to do something and proving that its complete and consistent is difficult (even with theorem provers its hard to prove a piece of software doesn't have state leaks and potential edge case bugs).",True

@sanjaymarison5629,2021-11-13T16:59:13Z,8,I tried writing whole projects with co-pilot and it did not work but writing parts of an app like the popup window with tkinter worked exceptionally well. Also scrapping websites just by saying ‚Äúscrap (website name)‚Äù worked super well. I did not even have to go and find the tag under which the content was located all i needed was to specify if it was title or body and it automatically picked the right one. It is truly amazing to see what it can do.,True

@atrumluminarium,2021-11-13T16:48:35Z,1,Lol I wonder if they used my first repo from university that had a buttload of bugs as a drop in the ocean of data to train the copilot. As if it wasn't bad enough that my mistakes were immortalised in the Github vault they did ü§£,True

@lukelabonte5924,2021-11-13T16:31:52Z,97,"There are a few potential problems I see with copilot that weren't addressed here.  First and foremost, as you said in the video, it does make mistakes. This is to be expected, but these mistakes might be much harder to catch and debug, especially for inexperienced programmers who might be relying on copilot to write code for them. Second is the legal aspect. Copilot was trained on Github code, and as far as I know, it will sometimes spit out an exact copy of some code it saw somewhere. This may have changed, but as of recently, Microsoft made it clear that it was the programmer's job to check for copyright infringement on code that copilot writes. For small projects, this is a difficult task. For large projects, or anything commercial, it makes copilot unusable.   Curious to hear your thoughts about this.",True
