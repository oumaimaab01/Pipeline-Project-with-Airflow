@samuellane4437,2022-10-30T20:19:37Z,0,"Just from my own playing around, I don't think for loops and while loops are interchangeable. For instance, I wrote a simple rock, paper, scissors game using the while loop to keep the game going until the user input a value equal to the exit variable. I rewrote the program using a for loop to keep the game going for 10 rounds only. That doesn't seem to be possible or as easy to do with a while loop...  Maybe I'm missing something, I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks. I'm quite a bit further ahead, but I wanted to come back to for loops because I feel like even though I can use them, I don't yet fully understand them...",True
