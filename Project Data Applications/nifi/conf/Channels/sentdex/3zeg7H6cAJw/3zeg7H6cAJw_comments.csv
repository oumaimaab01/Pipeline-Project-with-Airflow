@GeminiDak0ta,2022-12-15T03:11:51Z,0,"I followed this tutorial and it's working great! Thank You!  Any suggestions on how to get it to work for ""Acrobot-v1""? I figured out how to get the actions updated from 2 (Left/Right) to 3 (negative torque, 0 torque, or positive torque), but the training part seems be the problem. I'm able to get a few random successes where the pendulum swings above the line. However, it seems like the training isn't working. Maybe a different type of network or network structure is needed? I've tried increasing the initial games to 100,000, playing around with the score requirement (-450 to -300 is what I tested) for the random games to start, modified the dropout a bit, etc, but all without luck.",True
