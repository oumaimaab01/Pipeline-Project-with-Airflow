@LabGecko,2019-04-28T13:34:23Z,4,"At 4:34 the reason to keep data / design / logic separate is for re-usability & copyright, to name two reasons. Re-usability makes it easier to do themes and custom layouts. For copyright, it is great to have the data separate from logic so you can copyright & work on logic without needing a lawyer to re-negotiate usage.
