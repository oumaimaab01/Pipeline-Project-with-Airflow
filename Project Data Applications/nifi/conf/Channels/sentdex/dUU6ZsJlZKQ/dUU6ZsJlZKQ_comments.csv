@alexholker1309,2021-01-31T17:44:54Z,0,"Maybe this has already been covered in your new video, but for target tracking AI I think you'd find it useful to look at a region completely surrounding the player's position and not just in front. That way you don't have NaN errors if you're looking away from the path, and you can use different logic if the mean matches are below the target (behind the player). For vehicle movement I reverse the turning direction and move backwards so the AI performs a three point turn, but here you could just release 'W' so you turn on the spot until the path is in front of you again.",True

@gaayushmaan,2021-01-30T16:13:21Z,0,"I think for having the mouse movement for center, the following that I thought up would be better:  Instead of just getting the dots, get the current position (that triangle thing - using hue 0 to 75) in another variable and have a mask on it as well. Now if we take the top white pixel on the y-axis and have it pass through the center of that triangle and extrapolate that line on both sides you shall have the current direction line. Going back to our minimap, if we use 2 consecutive dots to create another line after extrapolation on both sides. Lets call it future direction line. Then, we can find the angle between the 2 lines and whether the current direction lies on which quadrant relative to future direction line, we can use those 2 values for our mouse movement. The main thing it would allow you is that you wouldn't need to zoom in (aka miniminimap) which makes it so that you will always have dots for direction. Also, we can reduce the calculations by skipping for some frames.",True

The goal would be to allow greater processing speed / quality but I am unaware of how to control another computer like a USB tether or over a local network.

@easyBob100,2021-01-15T19:05:54Z,0,"Here's a thought, although, it'd be a lot of work:  Using multiple NN's, train one to know if the player is in or out of a car, train others to detect other situations as well, like if the user is holding a weapon, talking to an NPC, if it's a cut scene, following a way point, etc.  Then connect them all to another network that makes the final 'decision' on what key presses and mouse moves to make.  I'm thinking it'd be like breaking down the problem into smaller bits that can be trained more easily.  Then the final network, with all the smaller networks feeding it input, can be trained simply by watching you play the game.   In essence, giving the NN the ability to understand the game state.   Just a thought. :)  It'd be a lot of work to label all that input data.",True
