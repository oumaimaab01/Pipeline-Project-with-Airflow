@cwayne4,2018-11-03T17:03:55Z,1,sma_20 < sma_50 can be fulfilled for multiple days in a row without an actual crossover of the MA's happening. So how does the program know only to send an order at the actual crossover point of the moving averages?,True

@joseluisalvarezescontrela9679,2017-07-28T21:07:52Z,0,"Hello I am a big fan of your channel, I was wondering if you know a way to put 'stop loss' orders based on the amount of loss instead of targeting a specific price to close the position. For example putting a stop loss when Im down 2% to close that position. Im trying to control my losses and the beta of the algo. Greetings from Caracas.",True
@tongbogeng7348,2017-07-06T19:34:17Z,1,"Question: you basically just changed the name of function to ma_crossover_handling, why did it speed up so much? You changed nothing of the trading function. First I didn't add a new function, I just put the old one into schedule func, it was running slowly. However when I used the new name, with the same content, the backtesting ran so fast.

@sdr224,2017-03-31T19:01:56Z,0,"I made the algo that you showcased here, but in my results, it is doing multiple transactions each day with a very small amount of the money available. I looked through the code and cant figure out why its doing those additional small transactions. Any ideas? Edit*** After further review, i believe the algo is re balancing the portfolio after the fluctuation of the day. So it buys a few more shares if it goes up, and sells a few if it goes down. I dont see your results as having that problem. How are you avoiding it?",True
@MorganPettersson,2017-03-17T15:10:10Z,1,Great tutorial! Thanks,True
@kevink3180,2017-02-10T04:37:19Z,6,"I have been watching a bunch of your videos, you have been doing a really great job! One minor request I would like to ask is that when you make a change in code on the screen keep it in view for about 1.5 seconds before scrolling away. A few times, you have had to jump around in code between different sections, and have moved so fast it is hard to pause the video at that spot to trouble shoot my code. (I am typing the code into another screen, and comparing my code to yours to make sure it is right. (or find our my typo.)  You normally do a good job of keeping all the code on the screen, all on one screen at the same time, but leaving it there a couple of extra seconds for us newbees -who are both trying to mentally process or understand it is useful)",True
