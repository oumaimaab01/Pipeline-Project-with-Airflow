I tried to find out if there is a actual video on your list, but i cant find one. I am a trader, and i would love to make my backtests in future with the help of python,  instead of using MetaTrader or other tradingsoftwares, which all have their problems in backtesting!!! Bec. for MetaTrader you have to learn C or C++, for NinjaTrader you have to learn C#, and so on, and not one of this developers, cares about to have a good backtest software, bec. otherwise the brokers will stop using this softwares. I would love to find here my freedom, by develop my own backtestsystem :-) Can you help me to get an actual start. I installed the newest version of python, it works, i can code some small programms and they work. But what interpretator do you use actual? Same problem i had for Qt Gui Programming, to make the buttons. I know your video, but you dont show how to install it, only to use it. I dont know what has to be installed first, or which version to use is okay, bec there is also a payed version. I can now code a bit c, c++, and c#, but i think its stupid to use all 3, and i would love to make everything with python :-) I would great if you can help, which videos from you would give me the best start :-) Thanks a lot!

How to recreate the problem:  Use Python 3 on Mac either through brew or Anaconda For example install using brew: brew install python3  Install matplotlib and pandas: pip3 install pylab  Start ipython:   ipython3 --pylab  Plotting using Pandas in ipython will create two plots instead of reusing a single plot window: import pandas as p d = p.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [5,7,9]}) d.hist() d.plot()   The goal is for matplotlib and packages that use matplotlib like Pandas and Seaborn to always use a single plot window, to clear it and reuse it for every plot.  So in the example code above the last statement d.plot() should not create a second plot window,  it should instead clear the first window and reuse it.",True

@MrBakerwang,2013-08-05T21:16:42Z,0,Nope. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt gives the error that dateutil is not found. So dead from the first statement.,True
@sentdex,2013-08-05T21:03:26Z,0,"In that case, download setup tools!   Google setuptools python 2.7, should be the first link to download it.  I am slightly confused, however. Did you ever successfully install matplotlib? Like, can you open up the python command line, and do:  import matplotlib  without errors? You should be able to plot this first graph purely with just matplotlib and that's it.",True
@MrBakerwang,2013-08-05T20:57:35Z,0,"Ugh, still not working. I looked at your DJANGO tutorial #1 and followed the steps, I think, but still no joy. Getting error ""no setuptools"":",True
@sentdex,2013-08-05T13:29:59Z,2,"Download 7-zip, and fully extract the tarball, its going to be 2 extractions. From there, install using python setup.py. I have done it on film a few times on film. One of them was for the Django tutorial series. Check that out if you still get stumped. Best wishes!",True
@MrBakerwang,2013-08-05T00:28:45Z,0,Getting error that dateutil is not found or some such message. I have downloaded it but cannot figure out how to install the tar file. There's a Python tarfile function but I can't get it to work. Very annoying! Any idea how to install dateutil?,True
@cafePrimero,2013-07-26T23:17:21Z,0,another great one. thanks!,True
@sentdex,2013-07-24T18:46:40Z,0,"Sounds like you don't have numpy! Definitely a must-have for charting and for all things math and python.   Go to google, type in numpy download and download/install it. I believe numpy has a pretty easy installer, like matplotlib did. Let me know if you have any trouble.",True
@anilkanaka,2013-07-24T18:41:06Z,0,"Hi,  hey i am trying to use matplot but whenevr i try to run the script which u mentioned in video gives below error , could you please tell me what might be the problem       File ""C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\colors.py"", line 52, in module     import numpy as np ImportError: No module named numpy ",True
@sentdex,2013-07-12T03:27:52Z,0,"Hey there, actually, I have indeed made this improvement. There was a few non-1080p videos recorded when I first made this account, and this is one of them. I assure you, the later videos are in beautiful HD, if you are willing to muddle through the ugly 480p beginning ones!",True
@VladimirSanchez,2013-07-12T01:34:26Z,0,"Dude, I really like your speech style and all but you should improve the resolution and font size. ",True
