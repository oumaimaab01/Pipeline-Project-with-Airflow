I tried to find out if there is a actual video on your list, but i cant find one. I am a trader, and i would love to make my backtests in future with the help of python,  instead of using MetaTrader or other tradingsoftwares, which all have their problems in backtesting!!! Bec. for MetaTrader you have to learn C or C++, for NinjaTrader you have to learn C#, and so on, and not one of this developers, cares about to have a good backtest software, bec. otherwise the brokers will stop using this softwares. I would love to find here my freedom, by develop my own backtestsystem :-) Can you help me to get an actual start. I installed the newest version of python, it works, i can code some small programms and they work. But what interpretator do you use actual? Same problem i had for Qt Gui Programming, to make the buttons. I know your video, but you dont show how to install it, only to use it. I dont know what has to be installed first, or which version to use is okay, bec there is also a payed version. I can now code a bit c, c++, and c#, but i think its stupid to use all 3, and i would love to make everything with python :-) I would great if you can help, which videos from you would give me the best start :-) Thanks a lot!

How to recreate the problem:  Use Python 3 on Mac either through brew or Anaconda For example install using brew: brew install python3  Install matplotlib and pandas: pip3 install pylab  Start ipython:   ipython3 --pylab  Plotting using Pandas in ipython will create two plots instead of reusing a single plot window: import pandas as p d = p.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [5,7,9]}) d.hist() d.plot()   The goal is for matplotlib and packages that use matplotlib like Pandas and Seaborn to always use a single plot window, to clear it and reuse it for every plot.  So in the example code above the last statement d.plot() should not create a second plot window,  it should instead clear the first window and reuse it.",True
