@michaelbachman5038,2015-12-12T15:45:04Z,0,"Can you create a ""hover-over"" annotation for each set of y values along the x-axis? For example, for each point along the x-axis, instead of--or in addition to--the line colors, can you annotate the values for 'sleeping', 'eating', 'working' and 'playing', such that when your mouse pointer hovers over an x-value, the y-values for each category displays?   Example: Mouse pointer hovers over Day 1, and the legend shows the values for each category on Day 1. Hover over Day 4, any the values for each category for Day 4 are displayed.  Also: Is there a way to create a movable vertical line that corresponds to each x-axis value to show the user his/ her position relative to the x-axis? (there may be a technical name for this type of line, but I don't know it).   Hope that this makes sense.",True
