@Seeker265729,2018-07-17T07:20:10Z,0,I think you might want some persistence with the known enemy  units.  In particular it looks like once in fog of war the known enemy units method drops off those units.  It might make sense to essentially copy known enemy units list and elements that drop off known enemy units can continue to persist in the copy for some period of time.  Because there is physics involved units can only move so fast so known enemy units don't actually disappear just because you can't see them.  They are probably still nearby,True

@tormentedbacon4573,2018-07-10T19:21:15Z,0,"Here's some alternative scout code I wrote.   It gets more information.   I actually have 2.   The first one I tried just went to the base and then used the ability to extend range.    I'll share it as well if that's what you want to do, but I find the 2nd one works better, while the ability code isn't really any better than the small roaming code from the video.  Basically what it does is it searches for the closest expanding points to the enemies base(and the enemy base itself), and then it randomly moves to each one, then the next, etc.     I currently have mine set to build 3 observers, they start dying pretty fast eventually, but you can tweak that.  You can also tweak the number of points to scout.  A good way of doing it would be to add to both as time goes on, but I don't have that coded.  Only started python a week ago, so if code can be improved, let me know.     You need to add 2 imports  from math import sqrt from operator import itemgetter  And here is the current code.   async def scout(self):   if (len(self.units(OBSERVER).idle) > 0):    locations = [[0, self.enemy_start_locations[0]]]    for possible in self.expansion_locations:     distance = sqrt((possible[0] - self.enemy_start_locations[0][0])**2 + (possible[1] - self.enemy_start_locations[0][1])**2)     locations.append([distance, possible])    locations = sorted(locations, key=itemgetter(0))    del locations[5:]    for s in self.units(OBSERVER).idle:     await self.do(s.move(random.choice(locations)[1]))   And here is the other function.     If nothing else it shows how to use an ability.     It doesn't require any imports, but you do need to add the ability to the constants list(I use * to import all).   async def scout_old(self):   if (len(self.units(OBSERVER)) > 0):    for s in self.units(OBSERVER).idle:     if s.distance_to(self.enemy_start_locations[0]) > 30:      await self.do(s.move(self.enemy_start_locations[0]))     else:      abilities = await self.get_available_abilities(s)      if AbilityId.MORPH_SURVEILLANCEMODE in abilities:       await self.do(s(AbilityId.MORPH_SURVEILLANCEMODE))       print (""Observer in Surveillance Mode"")   Alternatively you can combine the 2 and just send a scout to each node and have them sit in surveillance mode.

This code wouldn't have been possible without them, I've watched a bunch of them including the basics.   Thanks a ton for them.",True

But for the sake of the performance of this network you should really get into sc2 first. learn some of the stretegies and information that is needed for a good player. For example suing an observer as your first scout gives you information about the enemy WAY to late . most people send one of their enital probes or the first or second probe you build, etc pp   Of cource i can understand that you want to build a working network and a proof of concept first but It would be so much wasted time if you build up a pile of training data which is more or less bad  thanks for all the effort you put into this!",True

@nathanwhittle1,2018-07-08T20:06:15Z,0,"Your issue with defeat/victory detection could potentially be solved by detecting when the game should be conceded by a bot- say when you have no units and buildings left for example, then quitting the game via the API call after setting a class field in your bot class to store that decision. In your run game loop, you can view the bot class objects after the game is complete and check that field and save the other bot's training data as a victory there.
