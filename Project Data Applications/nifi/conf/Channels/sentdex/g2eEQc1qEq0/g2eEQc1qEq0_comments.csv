@francescodallevedove5018,2019-03-09T15:29:55Z,0,+sentdex thank you for this cool series! I have a question for you: I know it's possible to set plots so that you right click on them and copy data and then paste these data in an excel file. Is there any easy method to do this or it requires some complex scripting. I know it's possible because once I had to use an .exe written in Python which allowed to do so. I looked a lot in google but found nothing. Thank you in advance.,True

@iceslim01,2015-07-16T13:11:42Z,0,"Hey man I watched some of your videos but I haven't watched all of the matplotlib ones. Was wondering if you knew a way to easily poll for the current day's OHLCV data, at any time during the actual open trading session. What I've been doing is downloading the yahoo 1d, putting each line into the array, adding all the volumes together, then writing the OHLC data plus the combined volume to the last line of a file, but it's INSANE slow, like 30+ minutes for 5000 tickers. I'm using the pandas get_data_yahoo and matplotlib and yahoo_historical in some other ways but they also only seem to get data from yesterday and backwards. Any ideas?",True
@2raddude,2015-07-12T02:49:42Z,0,Did you mean to publish 32 videos at once?,True
