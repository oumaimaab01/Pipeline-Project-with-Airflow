@viny12345678,2017-12-10T20:50:55Z,0,"I think you misconcieved what the purpose is of the titan v. The titan v is meant for deep-learning, not gaming, rendering or even mining. Of course you can these things, but it is not the main purpose of the titan v. It is also definitly not meant for  the average consumer, hence the steep price. And it is not even the most expensive GPU, I believe the Nvidia Quadro series are about twice the price of a titan v. But I DO think that you need/want one. I would even donate (this would even be my first donation ever)  to get you this card specificly, so you should definitly start some Kickstarter or Indiegogo project. Can't wait to see some major improvements for your AI's because of this card.",True

@stevecoxiscool,2017-12-09T14:04:26Z,0,Lot of activity in chat bots right now. Googles Tensorflow speech recognition examples don't seem to work out of the box which tells me they may be moving on to something else that works better but they are going to keep it to themselves until they can monetize the solution. THAT's when we all get the solution to play with for free. I think people are going to figure out that you can't just push a bunch of data at a Deep (anything) and have it poop out a usable solution. Just my two pesos .... Keep up the great content !!!!,True

,2017-12-09T10:04:54Z,3,"It is always better to use open standards when you develop stuff, since it is always easier to port and stuff. For example, displayport, freesync, opencl, opengl, ... Amd can only use less R&D money to compete on all fronts, that is why they will alway lack a bit behind, 1 to 2 years usually.
