@pramodnagare4164,2019-12-19T06:18:23Z,1,"Solution for Almost all the errors reported! If you want to replicate the exact demo what sentdex presented, then instead of trying using your machine, use AWS EC2 Instance, so that you won't corrupt your systems with the package version dependencies! 1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com and login 2. Launch an AWS EC2 Instance preferably Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 16.04)  3. Make sure you have the key for the instance and provide proper security group access to your IP 4. ssh to ec2 instance 5. source pytho3 environment 6. pip install pip==9.0.3 Ignore the warnings 7. pip install cryptography==2.1.4 Ignore the warnings 8. pip install flask_ask Ignore the warnings or If errored then pip install flask_ask==0.9.8 9. Create app.py file with code mentioned in the video demo, replace username and password 10. In this ssh window run the file using:  python app.py 11. Open another ssh window for the same ec2 instance and connect 13. Go to the path where you have app.py file 12. Download ngrok for Linux using: wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip 13. After download run command: unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip 14. to run ngrok use command: ./ngrok http 5000 15. Setup your Alexa skill in https://developer.amazon.com/ as per the video 16. Provide the https endpoint for the Alexa skill and its done 17. You can test your new Alexa skill using console or Actually ask you Alexa (for me its Alexa start reddit reader) 18. It Worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally, so happy and just after that, I wrote this comment before I forget!    Good Luck! Reply to this comment if you stuck at ant step.   Thank you sentdex for the great video!!!    - Pramod",True
