@mayse34,2017-03-09T02:52:01Z,0,"Hello ,  I am running the full code put out up through Part 12 and the data runs just fine however I keep receiving this error: Key Error: 'ZTS_Target' when I attempt to run the do_ml('ticker') function at the end.   Thus the Error is Key Error: 'ZTS_target' . Any ticker I attempt to use do_ml('ticker') on causes me to receive that error. With one exception being do_ml('ZTS') which spits out the results just fine. Its as if the code is only reading in the last ticker on the Wikipedia page listed which happens to be ZTS. However is disregarding all the others?  Any idea what could be going wrong here? Obviously the code is only reading that function for the last ticker on wiki page for both scenarios when all the S&P 500 tickers are run.",True

@MrIgorbpf,2017-01-23T17:19:34Z,26,"Hey, man! I think there is a critical error here. For me the problem is when u split the data. When u are working with time series, u need to respect the timeline. I mean u cannot use data of 2016 to train and test on data of 2015.  If u do that, the algorithm will be biased. Scikit-learn train_test_split shuffles the data so u lose the chronological order. That's the problem!",True
