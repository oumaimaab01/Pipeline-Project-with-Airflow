@albertkisiel4346,2017-01-23T09:48:12Z,0,"there is also possibility to get quite readable code without enumerate:  for i in example:     print(example.index(i), i)  as you know i accepts every value of example in order: from left to right. thats why you can access index of i by example.index(i) which will give you result equal to using enumerate function.   it works only thanks to order of iteration.  maybe it isn't best solution but maybe beginners will find out something new  (i'm sorry if my explanation and whole comment isn't understable, i'm not a good teacher and english isn't my primary language)",True
@playful_batman,2016-12-08T11:03:27Z,0,"The best use of 'enumerate' that I have seen so far is in getting the indices of a sorted list: [ i[0] for i in sorted(enumerate(myList), key=lambda x: x[1]) ]",True
