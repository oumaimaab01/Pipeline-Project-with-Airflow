@coryrobinson7814,2017-08-07T03:30:35Z,0,"Im struggling. I wrote this little program to switch on a relay. the relay will close the circuit for the trigger of a fully motorized Nerf gun.  import RPi.GPIO as gpio import time  def init():     gpio.setmode(gpio.BOARD)     gpio.setup(22, gpio.OUT)  def fire(tf):     init()     gpio.output(22, True)     time.sleep(tf)     gpio.cleanup()  print 'fire' fire(3)  I want to incorperate that little program in to the face recognition software. But, when I run the program, it switches on the relay, prints ""fire"", and then prints ""0 faces found"". I want it to ONLY fire if 1 or more faces are found. here is the rest of my code. Please help me solve my problem.  import io import picamera import cv2 import numpy from cbcnn import fire  #Create a memory stream so photos doesn't need to be saved in a file stream = io.BytesIO()  #Get the picture (low resolution, so it should be quite fast) #Here you can also specify other parameters (e.g.:rotate the image) with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:     camera.resolution = (320, 240)     camera.capture(stream, format='jpeg')  #Convert the picture into a numpy array buff = numpy.fromstring(stream.getvalue(), dtype=numpy.uint8)  #Now creates an OpenCV image image = cv2.imdecode(buff, 1)  #Load a cascade file for detecting faces face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('/home/pi/cbot/faces.xml/haarcascade_front$  #Convert to grayscale gray = cv2.cvtColor(image,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  #Look for faces in the image using the loaded cascade file faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 5)  print ""Found ""+str(len(faces))+"" face(s)""  if len(faces) > 0:     run_command(""fire"")  #Draw a rectangle around every found face for (x,y,w,h) in faces:     cv2.rectangle(image,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)  #Save the result image cv2.imwrite('result.jpg',image)",True

@rafaeljrzuniga6690,2016-01-14T20:02:06Z,0,"Hey sentdex, great videos! I just wanted to let you know that another option that you can use for user input instead of tkinter is the pygame library. I coded mine this way. I don't know if it's better but i feel like it gives you more flexibility in what you can code.  Keep it up!",True
