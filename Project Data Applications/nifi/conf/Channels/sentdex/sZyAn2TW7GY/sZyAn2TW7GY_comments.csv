@mithridil,2016-11-10T02:29:32Z,0,"I have this code:  prefixes = re.findall(r'^(un|con|in|pre)?(un|con|in|pre)?(un|con|in|pre)?(.*)$',unpredictable )  It means that in a string (word) we have more than one prefixes un-, pre-..... i want to use a regex lookahead to every one of them so my code understands that there should be a word (.*) after the 3d parenthesis (un|con|in|pre), there should be a prefix (from 3d parenthesis) after the 2nd parenthesis and so on...  I want to do this cause i want to check if the last one is a real word from a wordlist... i will replace (.*) with a word from a wordlist. For example if i give the word ""redeconstruct"" i want to make my code understand that there should be a word struct from the wordlist first, then at its left one of the prefixes in 3d parenthesis, then at its left one in 2nd and so on...

@sonic2kk,2014-07-22T14:59:45Z,0,"I was so excited for this tutorial! :D Regex would have been so useful to me a while ago, but I kinda forgot about it... I had to use some fancy string methods to split parts of a string and parse it myself. It was longer than regex would have been, but I think that it would have been _cleaner_ in a way. Maybe it's because I'm kinda new to it, but regex looks really ugly and messy, but it gets the job done I suppose. I also didn't know that the escape characters were actually regex! That's awesome though!  In your loop, you could say this to save yourself having to make a temporary variable for the index:  # ... for i, eachName in enumerate(list_name): ¬†¬†¬† ageDict[eachName] = ages[i] # ...  I actually only recently found out about the enumerate built in function from a Python talk I believe it was. It's a good way to loop through a list and get the index too, but I'm sure there's an even shorter way to do it.  I'm mainly interested in regex because of Django. In my Django URL, I have the following line: r'^(?P<pk>\d+)$ I'm just going by what I remember from the video, but what I understand is:  r'^ - That's going to match a regular expression starting from the start of a string  (?P<pk> - I'm not sure what this does. I'm not sure what the parentheses mean either, but I know the question mark means 0 or more, so it's trying to match 0 or more of whatever P<pk> is I think.  \d+ - This will match 1 or more numbers.  This URL is for my blog, and it's for the post. So this matches a URL for the blog post ID. I'm not sure where ""P<pk>"" comes from or what it means though. I suppose I don't _need_ to understand this, because it works, but I like to understand what my code does so I can debug it better for future projects, understand more about regex and Django, and so I can actually know what it does.  I see on the website that you're planning a Tkinter part of this series. I'm really excited for that too! Your videos are awesome, and I hope you keep them coming :D Have a great day!",True
