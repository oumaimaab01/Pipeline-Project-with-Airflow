@jasperwilliams3154,2016-01-02T10:17:18Z,0,"It seems rather strange, someone making a video on how to install 'any' program, and doesn't have a zip program ready and waiting, sort of counters the idea of a ""I can teach you . . . anything."" If that wasn't silly enough, then you go to a notorious, communist media-related, sophomoric download site to get a zip program you should have had before you turned on your camera?  I thought your generation was so smart on these issues? Ever think of just going to 7-zip website and downloading it directly from the wonderfully generous makers of said product? . . .  or could it be CNET pumps a penny or two your way so they can stuff some ignorant net junkie's computer with their communist engineered-ideological hogware-bullcrap? CNET is not only a morally bankrupt site that unethically attempts loading spyware, malware and other immoral crap on your system, it's simply an ancient, completely unnecessary site that should have left the WWW about the time Windows 3.1 was upgraded? ? ?  Here's a hint. If you're going to make a video entitled ""installing"" . . .  whatever . . . you might not want to waste people's time with 8 minutes of complaining about original logos and making it sound like CNET is the go to source for a program, which by the way, a similar one is already on your win-7 OS?  Just a thought. . .",True

@filipmarkoski1730,2015-10-26T21:54:48Z,4,"Can you make a new series? This one is old, a few things have changed in Django 1.8, I think it deserves a fresh new start. You can make a blog app, using Bootstrap, you can also make a Register/Login system so people can post on the blog, maybe show the viewers how to connect with facebook, gmail etc. (the big social networks), you can take it even further with designing a chat system. Just a few ideas. Anyway keep it up. Good Content.",True
