@raifegencer7482,2020-10-01T22:32:45Z,0,When I write the code it says 'Nonetype' object has no attribute 'shape'. what should I do ?,True
@vudinhhung942k,2020-06-03T11:49:45Z,1,"For anyone confused about the zip(*loc[::-1] and template.shape[::-1], the [::-1] is just python slice notation [start:stop:step]. In this case: - template.shape returns a tuple of the dimensions of said ""template"" (which is a 2-dimensional numpy array, since ""template"" is a grayscale image. A color image would have 3 dimensions, 1 more for RGB). Using the [::-1] python slice notation, template.shape returns the whole tuple in backwards order (since step is -1).  We would get the exact same result here with ""h, w = template.shape[::]"", or more simply ""h, w = template.shape"". - For zip(*loc[::-1]), loc is simply a list of indexes taken from the ""result"" grayscale image produced by cv2.matchTemplate, which is a map of how much each region of the of image matches the template (each pixel is a value from 0 to 1, representing the 'matchiness' of each region, you could try printing it out to see what I mean). Since loc = np.where(res >= threshold), loc is the indexes of all values larger than 0.8. Since the ""result"" image is 2 dimensional, ""loc"" is a tuple of 2 arrays of values from each dimension (rows and columns) in ""result"". zip simply combines these row and col values together, so each ""pt"" in zip would be one (row, col) pair.  The reason he uses ""zip(*loc[::-1])"" instead of simply ""zip(*loc)"" is because the cv2.rectangle function takes pt1 and pt2 values, which has to be (width, height), while loc[0] is the height array and loc[1] is the width array. We needed to read the loc tuple backwards to get width first, hence the -1 step value. As for the asterisk (*) operator,  it simply unpacks any iterables into discrete values. sentdex, I really appreciate all the work that you put into these videos to share the knowledge. But these later videos in the series do feel a little underexplained imo. In this video, the logic of putting heights and widths in which order should at least have been mentioned.",True

@DoNotFlyINsideOUT,2016-02-07T18:27:44Z,0,"Hey Sentdex Really appreciating these videos and your responses,  So I backtracked a little and decided that a HAAR cascade would be maybe an overkill for just recognizing a specific PVC pipe so now i am trying to set up a template with it instead.   I managed to take out the background of my image of my pvc pipe and set it as the template. I am also reading a video instead of the picture and it seems to be a problem. (edit: the template is a picture, but i am trying to find it on a video)  I keep encountering the error code""AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'""  for the line ""w, h = template.shape[::-1]""   would it not be possible to do template matching on a video capture or am i just not following the correct logic. (the logic that i followed is the same one for the picture in this tutorial but maybe i am missing something).   Thank you",True
@kishankedia2232,2016-01-27T07:03:47Z,0,"@sentdex Great video .  I have one question , Can't we take the images in the BGR format itself and pass it to the matchTemplate method rather than converting it to Gray Scale??   Actually after seeing your video i tried this on an image , The Template had  a lot of boxes of different colors , I tried to match the blue box but all the boxes got matched , Can you help me out with this problem .",True

@velocityra,2016-01-02T20:26:54Z,3,"Are you going to build a project at the end of the series? I'm not very familiar with your videos, but until now you only seem to be show casing OpenCV's *functions*. I mean, with all due respect, I could get all that by just reading the documentation, or even their own tutorials. I understand that some people prefer video, but is there something extra that you can do for people like me? Like use it in a practical, real-world scenario at the end of the series?

@alphadevops,2016-01-02T19:43:19Z,1,"Happy holidays. I have another random suggestion! Matplotlib series is pretty great. It is great-looking, robust, and well documented, however; for some applications PyQtGraph excels over Matplotlib. You're a smart guy so I won't discuss why here.  It is instrumental to a lot of engineering data analysis, vibration FFT is a great example. Medical imaging is another and it plays well with this image analysis video series.  If you ever have time or consider another ""sciency"" tutorial I would love to see integration with PQTG. The examples module is very fun to play with anyways.",True
@eb9836,2016-01-02T16:02:14Z,1,Nice! Can the match be done with color spectrum included? Or does that add too much extra process for the incremental benefit? Always enjoy your quick and complete video tutorials. Happy New Year!,True
