@DanielWilday,2021-10-27T22:25:37Z,1,"I just stumbled upon this, now slightly old, video series and it's really great.  I have a question (which may never get answered as this is so old) While I know the BCI FFT data has the shape of (16, 60)... for a linear interpolation of this wouldn't you want to swap the axes so that the new shape would be (60, 16)?    I'm new to Machine Learning so I'm likely wrong here.. but in my limited understanding a Conv1D kernel travels linearly along the x axis which would represent time (or in this case frequency), with the y axis acting like channels.  If that's the case I'd assume you'd want to travel along the waveform of a single FFT, across all channels.    Again, I'm new to this and ok with being wrong.  Any clarification on this would be super welcome.  Thanks!",True

@jond532,2020-12-29T04:01:08Z,0,Maybe instead of perfecting its ability to predict if we are thinking left or right...we should change how we actually think about left or right? Maybe if we found certain thoughts that the ai found easy to predict we could use them as a way of triggering left or right. Basically test different thoughts and see what is most easily detectable and substitute them for actually thinking left or right. Use an ai to find the most effective thoughts and label each thought.  like making a mental language.,True

@alexandremarcil498,2019-11-17T19:34:32Z,0,"Hi Sentdex, nice project!  Moving a mouse with your hand will not contaminate the EEG signal with EMG. To capture EMG, you would need EMG electrodes on your arm to capture the electrical activity of muscles moving your arm.  This electrical activity is not recorded by the EEG (maybe only the intention or signal coming from the brain telling the arm to move, but that is not EMG).  Your heart beats regularly (I hope), yet an EEG does not capture EKG data.  To do that, you need electrodes positioned close to the heart, or on both arms.  Moving your eyes or blinking your eyelids will give rise to some EMG artifacts, as these muscles are close enough to the electrodes on your head to be picked up (and also the fact that the EMG signal is much stronger than the EEG one).  Hope this clarifies things a bit.  What you are saying about EMG doesn't make sense.  Thanks for sharing your code and data!",True

@willdawiz0,2019-11-17T00:28:27Z,31,"Cool mug! I have a bit of experience in EEG and ML, specifically learning to classify sleep phases -- you've chosen a super difficult but interesting problem. Not sure where you'd ultimately like to take this but a few recommendations:   1. agree with others that wavelets might be best transform 2. absolutely should be using a time window of data, you're throwing out a crucial aspect! brains are dynamic systems, how things are changing is arguably more important than their current value state, preprocessing into frequencies doesn't mean you can't take advantage of the time-series nature of the data.  3. 'Left' vs 'Right' is intuitively simple but thorny given what you're getting out of an EEG, these mental concepts are distributed all over your brain in different activity patterns, and they're actually pretty similar concepts. If you're willing to change your task but want to stick to 3 classes, you could try rest and two wildly different concepts that will evoke different brain regions and rhythms, even emotions -- MRI has way more spatial/temporal resolution and still benefits from this: ( https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/03/vegetative-state-patient-communication ) . Otherwise I saw a suggestion to play flappy bird with it on the last video, and binary event classification is way easier, as you've deduced. You can use this principle even in multi-class, training multiple binary classifiers and then using your favorite ensemble/arbiter method. 4. Definitely don't watch the computer / graphics output as you create training data unless you've really thought the experiment through, Neurofeedback does some cool stuff in a therapy setting but might corrupt your ""Left"" thought with ""the square is going right!"" thoughts 5. I'm a bit out of practice in conv nets but consider a way bigger model / param number, or generally get creative with architecture, you're trying to predict the output of a biological neural net with something like quintillions of parameters Loving the series so far, good luck ;)",True

@angrymurloc7626,2019-11-15T20:14:21Z,0,"In response to your point, that this should be applicable for people with a disability: Unless fully paralyzed for a very long time, even people with a disability will have some neural connection from brain to muscle, and since you wouldn't be learning from the data at the muscle itself, that shouldn't be an issue.  I would suggest the following points, which I'm sure would make your BCI more effective, for any person using it: Try to see the BCI as some imaginary limb, for which you have to learn movement, like you would with an arm or a leg. DON'T try to equate verbal thought to movement, as that is nonsensical from a neural standpoint. Your neural representation of the word left is very complicated. For example, since it's a direction, one of the closest associations with the word 'left' will be the word 'right'. Your data will be very hard to read if you deliberately mix it. Also try to think about how to continually generate data. Like for example, you could first try to learn the difference between correct and incorrect, by simply generating data with headset keyboard and BCI output, and having a model learn, what your neural representation of failure would be. If you have that, the next step is only to set the loss of the model to the amount of failure that your brain detects, and you can have the BCI adjust to you while you use it. Obviously you'd need to stop to let the network train for a while, but I'm pretty sure that the results will be much better than what you're getting here.

I've just started my PhD where I will be exploring deep learning techniques in the context of creating EEG-based BCI controller. My background is in biomedical engineering so I'm quite familiar with medical signals like EEG and I want to share with you my findings in the topic of EEG-BCI. Maybe I'll start with some example:  https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0192.pdf - here's a paper where the authors used modified GAN to create images out of EEG data. They've used some extra tricks to get some pretty amazing results (by nowadays standard) - like additional information to the loss function. They've also created the EEG MAP - it's basically and image that combines time and EEG channel data into single image which should ""represent"" the cognitive domain.   https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/papers/camera_ready_acmmm_BNI08.pdf - here's another example of exactly the same task done with both GAN and Variational Autoencoder.   And because I don't want to spam you with links - there you have a survey on different approaches at different tasks in the context of EEG-BCI - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04149.pdf , maybe you'll find some of them usefull and if not at least you'll get an interesting reading ;)  In the video you've mentioned that you don't have any idea if model trained on your EEG will work on somebody else - to my knowlage of the latest studies in this topic I've only seen one constant argument, that deep learning based BCI systems have the property of: model per person (sadly) - so in this domain there's plenty of room for improvement ;)    This particular problem is actually the case of my study - I'll try to create methods that will help deep learning models generalize beyond the scope of a single person in the task of reconstruction the visual stimuly :).

Your preprocessing must be solid. Just doing notch doesn't work. You should look at PCA and ICA to preprocess your data and then try to train a model.
