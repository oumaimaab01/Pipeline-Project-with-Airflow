@Mil-Keeway,2024-02-13T14:09:53Z,0,"3:38 it doesn't have the prices ""in quotes like a string"", it's a properly exported csv that has ALL fields quoted. Your pd.read_csv is missing quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL (or just quoting=1) and optionally quotechar='\""' . The only ""magic"" pandas is doing is interpreting that column as quoted. If you add those options, I'm guessing cudf will run just as well, since the ingest portion will still be using python standard lib or at least pandas C implementations.",True

@EarlZMoade,2023-11-18T11:01:15Z,1,What's the reasoning for not using groupby in this demo? Wouldn't that be the more natural and faster pandas method to use - instead of looping over everything.  Feels a little disingenuous to compare poorly optimised pandas code that no one would actually write.,True

@HarrisBallis,2023-11-12T22:02:30Z,54,"Enabling cuDF using a single flag is insane! However, I just wannted to point out (especially for new pandas users) that the proper way to calculate average price per city in pandas is by using groupby. Running `df.groupby('Town/City')['price'].mean()` in plain pandas is blazing fast (a few ms), nothing compared to 19 minutes. That doesn't mean that cuDF is not useful, but don't forget that using plain pandas properly can get you a long way.",True

@harshvaragiya8834,2023-11-10T15:53:07Z,24,Awesome video! I encountered a similar issue where I had to process ~8 GB of data using an AWS Lambda (limited RAM and time). I used polars (pandas alternative written in rust from scratch for performance) and I found it to be blazing fast . It's really really useful - especially with non nvidia devices like my raspberry pi and the AWS lambda function. You should definitely check it out!,True

@damianshaw8456,2023-11-10T15:45:43Z,6,"For the read_csv operation I would be curious what is actually taking the most amount of time with the Pandas object, I suspect it's building the Python string objects, and if so I wonder if you have PyArrow installed and set pd.options.future.infer_string = True it would be much faster?  And in general it makes sense that using strings are slow in Pandas, because it's falling back to looking up a Python object by via reference to it, it's actually a much more interesting comparison for number or datetime data types. For strings it would be much more interesting if you had use the PyArrow string data type.",True
