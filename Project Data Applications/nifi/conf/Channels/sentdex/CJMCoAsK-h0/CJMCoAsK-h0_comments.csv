@calvinbarajas5144,2019-05-08T19:00:26Z,0,"Awesome video, thanks very much. At  4:50, are you showing horizontal edges only (sobely)? I imagine you could have also shown vertical edges by using: cv2.imshow('sobelx', edges). Thanks for the feedback.",True
@be9196,2019-05-08T16:24:14Z,0,"As written, this throws an error for all of the cv2.imshow() calls, except of the original.

@alexfan1109,2019-01-01T02:37:23Z,1,"Just a tip. If you do a Gaussian blur before feeding into the edge detector, you can filter out the noise, because the Gaussian is a low-pass filter.",True

@germancarrasco2028,2017-11-01T06:15:47Z,3,Lap-la-cian? It is La-pla-cian (related to the Laplace operator). The Laplace operator was named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827). Anyway. Good tutorials.,True
