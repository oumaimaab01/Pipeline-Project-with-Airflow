@rahultiwari55,2020-03-24T12:13:21Z,0,mdates.strpdate2num has been deprecated it's mdates.datestr2num. But mine issue is different I have milliseconds too. %Y-%M-%D %H:%M:%S.%? I don't know what to put for millisecond.,True

Quick question though and I see that this question has been an issue for others as well. When I use the converters part where you use strpdate2num I get of course the comment that this function was deprecated but I cannot figure out an alternative way. I've tried to use datestr2num but also I don't find a way to use it. any hint would be much appreciated!",True
