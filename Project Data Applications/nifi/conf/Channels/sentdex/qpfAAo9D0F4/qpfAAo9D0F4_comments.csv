@okandemirbaykal5597,2022-02-23T20:03:59Z,4,"Around 5:30 - The temperature difference is likely because you removed the side / top panel and the fans had access to fresh-er air, and not because of any passive convection the radiator is doing. While all the parts are watercooled, the waterblocks, motherboard VRMs, RAM sticks, SSDs, other teeny-tiny stuff still dissipate enough heat that'd increase the delta between what's measured in the air intake probe and the air that's actually going into the fans and then the radiator. Also, while that's a very thick radiator, a 360mm (or even a 420mm) radiator is still not very much for 4x 250W TDP cards and a 280W TDP CPU. With the pipes and all, this would be difficult, but it could be fun to see if there's any noticeable improvement with a fan duct isolating the air sucked in from the front into the 2 fans further away from the GPUs.",True
