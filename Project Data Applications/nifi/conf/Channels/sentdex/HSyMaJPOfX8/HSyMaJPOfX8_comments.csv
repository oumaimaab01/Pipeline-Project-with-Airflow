@AnupumPant,2017-03-27T02:04:05Z,0,"Great tutorials Harrison. Thank you. I wanted to add that to save better resolution plots I added a little dpi parameter. fig.savefig(stock+'_candlestick_chart.png', facecolor=fig.get_facecolor(), dpi=1000)",True
@martinc3907,2015-08-08T13:39:33Z,0,I've installed Python 3.4 on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit platform and the matplotlib module is located in the directory:   /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/matplotlib  In Python 2.7 I found the matplotlib module in the directory:  /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib   However it gets more complicated as finance.py is a shortcut file to:    /usr/share/pyshared/matplotlib/finance.py and this is where the actual finance.py file resides for Python 2.7  This is interesting as Python2.7 as has the following directory:  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages  but matplotlib is not there.  I checked out Paulo Santos's suggestion and the folder is shortcut folder that goes to the /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/matplotlib location containing the finance.py shortcut.,True
@PauloSantos-qk5gz,2014-02-11T06:12:46Z,1,in ubuntu matplotlib files are in main\var\lib\python-support\python2.7\matplotlib,True
