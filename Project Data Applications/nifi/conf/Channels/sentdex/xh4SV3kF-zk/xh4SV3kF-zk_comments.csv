@alvarosuarez3020,2021-04-14T14:04:27Z,0,Other question. Why I have to ask for an event == KEYDOWN if the user will be not pressing? Why not I just ask to K_LEFT or K_RIGHT directly?,True
@alvarosuarez3020,2021-04-14T13:58:55Z,0,Hi... I have a question. How can I make to move the car to up and down?,True
@bjornwakker,2021-03-14T11:26:47Z,0,"key = pygame.key.get_pressed()         if key[pygame.K_LEFT]:                 x_change = -6         if key[pygame.K_RIGHT]:                 x_change = 6         if key[pygame.K_LEFT] and key[pygame.K_RIGHT]:             x_change = 0   this makes the movement smoother, and its less lines, and it doesnt have to check the event for this so it makes your program a little fast. it also makes it so that when you hold right and left it cancels out",True
@trevosh15,2021-02-21T14:13:27Z,0,I fixed the getting stuck problem by just having a seperate positive and negative value variables for my x. For example:    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: #check if the event was a keypress             if event.key == pygame.K_a:                 char_changexn = -keypressx             elif event.key == pygame.K_d:                 char_changexp = keypressx   Then I just added the values together later: charXloc += char_changexp + char_changexn to get the new location value,True
@cbnctthotakura2849,2021-02-14T13:39:42Z,0,instead of the keyup or keydown method you could use this:  keys = pygame.key.get_pressed() if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:         player_x += vel     if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:         player_x -= vel     if keys[pygame.K_UP]:         player_y -= vel     if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:         player_y += vel Variables: vel = 5,True

@mxp9000,2020-10-07T20:17:20Z,0,"To prevent sticking and also prevent the car from traveling while holding both keys you can do something like  x_change=0 if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:             if event.key==pygame.K_a:                 x_change+=-5             elif event.key==pygame.K_d:                 x_change+=5          if event.type==pygame.KEYUP:             if event.key==pygame.K_a:                 x_change+=5             elif event.key==pygame.K_d:                 x_change+=-5",True

Why won't: for event in pygame.event work?  Also around 1:35.  The syntax: if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: was used.  What exactly does the .type mean?  The type of event?

@mage1over137,2017-03-07T19:56:10Z,8,"The getting suck bug, is a problem with pygame, but is cause by using KEYUP and KEYDOWN some what improperly. So let's say you're pressing left, car moves left, then you press right while still pressing left, car moves right, then releasing right while still pressing left set x_change=0 and you stop(the player would expect the car to move left). This happens because KEYUP and KEYDOWN are not really used for dynamic things like movement. What you should use instead is keys=pygame.get_pressed() #return a list of bool, keys being pressed will be true if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:       x_change=-5 else:        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:              x_change=5        else:                x_change=0 So pygame.get_pressed returns a list of bool for each key on the board. If the key is being pressed at that moment it's true, else false. This code is easier to read and faster to right. The KEYUP and KEYDOWN method works for toggling modes, say to pause or to go to a debug mode, but using for something as dynamic as control is prone to these sort of errors and should really be avoid.",True

@KeshavPatelisTotallyAwesome,2016-01-19T00:31:57Z,4,"I think I know why the image doesn't move reliably.   So if you push the right and left key in quick succession, sometimes, you'll end up pushing down on one key before you let up on the other.   What I mean is if I want to swap from going left and suddenly go right, I'll push down on right and let go of left. But letting go of the left arrow generates a KEYUP event and that ends up being the event that's read by our code instead of the KEYDOWN event that we want.   What this means is that the most recent value in our event queue ends up being a KEYUP event, and our x_change variable gets set to 0!   I don't think we can change the way pygame takes input without modifying the source code itself, but I'll look around for some alternate forms of taking keyboard input that may help.   Alternatively you could just take input using the mouse...",True
