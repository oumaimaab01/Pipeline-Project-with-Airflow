@Veptis,2022-05-26T00:35:38Z,0,"I have watched a bunch of videos about what reinforcement learning can do. But I gave up on the Steve Brunton series. Perhaps I watch this series instead and understand how learning is done everything I did so far has been just gradient based learning. And I don't know if reinforcement learning applies to language. Maybe in a conversational setting.   I have a game from my childhood: Mirror's Edge mobile edition. Which you can't no longer buy as EA removed it from the store instead of updating it. As it essentially just has 6 discrete inputs I could see how it can be learned. But the levels are limited, so it might overfit easily. And rewards can't just be time, as that requires success in the first place.",True
