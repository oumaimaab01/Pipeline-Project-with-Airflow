@Hayri491,2016-02-22T01:41:36Z,4,"You probably have heard this a lot haha, no homo but I could listen to you teach and not get bored. I tried learning 10 years ago, from a tutorial a teacher asked me to try out and see if I enjoyed it. Probably thought I would be interested. The guys voice had me fallen asleep and bored. You sound motivated, excited not mumbling or rushing. The perfect teacher! The fact you also think of errors and tell is just an added bonus! Thank you, my first language at 25...Hopefully in the next 10 years I would have also learnt c++. So much to do, and seems like more fun than just playing a video game. And the use of Python in Maya are endless. I also do 3D modelling so Python is an all round amazing language to learn.
