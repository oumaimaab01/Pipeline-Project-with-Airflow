I thought it might we an issue with the settings in respect to the database. I really just want to take few Python apps I use with APIs for financial stuff and get them on the web to access from any browser, and I can't find a quick and dirty way to do it without diving into Django etc. I think you have the quickest way with this DigitalOcean etc, but still got me frustrated after many hours.

@personaftl4083,2017-01-03T05:15:04Z,7,"I ran into 2 errors and figured out both solutions. They related to updates to django since  video was posted. Error #1: DisallowedHost at / Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX'. You may need to add u'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX' to ALLOWED_HOSTS. Cause: In django 1.10 Django checks the Host header of the HTTP request for a url/ip address that is within the allowed hosts.  Solution: You will need to edit the settings.py and there is a line ALLOWED_HOSTS. This is a list, and it should contain your home networks IP (google what is my ip). Your updated file should look like this. ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['XXX.XXX.XXX.XX'] Sources: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts  Error #2: ImportError at / cannot import name patterns Cause: As of Django 1.10, the patterns module has been removed (it had been deprecated since 1.8). Solution: You will need to edit the urls.py and remove settings from the import. Your updated file should look like this. from django.conf.urls import include, url http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8074955/cannot-import-name-patterns https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/http/urls/#example  After updated the above.

However, I didn't see the updated changes on the deployed website, so tried pip install django again, which broke my website, giving me ""DisallowedHost at /""MY DOMAIN""  Invalid HTTP_HOST header: You may need to add u ""MY DOMAIN"" to hosts.

@TimBeauBennett,2016-12-18T01:55:50Z,1,"Thanks for everything so far H, great series.  I don't know exactly what happened, but my database wouldn't copy over. An empty db file ended up existing in the folder, so I had to re run my migrations and create another super user. But then it was set to read only, which broke both the blog and the admin app. I set the file to 777 permissions, which is apparently dangerous but was the only thing that worked, then I admin worked and I could make more blog posts.  No idea what happened there - any thoughts would be appreciated though.",True
