@tacocat5034,2018-03-13T00:03:45Z,1,"sentdex, really like your tutorials, but disagree with this one. You were running your regression on the share price - of course you get high correlation. Try to correlate share price, not changes in share price but actual share price - one period against another with some relatively small lag/shift - you will get high correlation. Because daily changes in the price are small vs its absolute value. You will get high correlations that are meaningless. So your model had high accuracy but did not predict anything - it just copied the past price movements. And when you removed the share price (which you should have never regressed against the future absolute price in the first place), you got no predictive power. Always regress changes in the share price, not the absolute share price. But then of course you will never get  a nice looking share price prediction because it is impossible with a linear regression.",True

@martinc3907,2016-11-12T11:17:13Z,0,"Hi Harrison,  Great tutorial, I am really enjoying it.  When you mentioned checking the assumptions, I thought you would talk about doing diagnostics. What you have done is just checked that the coefficient of determination is working as it should.  What if your underlying data is non-linear. Well you can still get a nice high coefficient of determination and so you may think a straight line is the best fit. But then your model will do poorly at forecasting, as you didn't account for the curve in the data.  So how do we check that we are fitting the right model. One way to check this is to plot the studentized residuals against the predicted y values (what you call the regression line). If our model is good the residual scatter plot will not show any patterns.  Below I have pasted your Python program with modifications to calculate studentized residuals and to plot them against the regression line.  When you plot the regression against the actual data it looks like a great fit, but when you look at the residuals plot it is quite obvious that you don't have the right model.   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- """""" Created on Fri Nov 11 12:14:23 2016  @author: marty """"""  from statistics import mean import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import style import random   style.use(""fivethirtyeight"")   #xs=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6], dtype=np.float64) #ys=np.array([5,4,6,5,6,7], dtype=np.float64)  def create_dataset(hm,variance,step=2, correlation=False):     val=1     ys=[]     for i in range(hm):         y = val + random.randrange(-variance,variance)         ys.append(y)         if correlation and correlation == 'pos':           val += step         elif correlation and correlation == 'neg':           val -= step     xs    = [i**2 for i in range(len(ys))]                   return np.array(xs, dtype=np.float64), np.array(ys, dtype=np.float64)  def bestfit(xs,ys):          m = (((mean(xs)*mean(ys)) - mean(xs*ys)) /     ((mean(xs)*mean(xs)) - mean(xs*xs)))          b = mean(ys) - m*mean(xs)               return m, b      def squared_error(ys_orig,ys_line):      return sum((ys_orig-ys_line)**2)         def Coefficient_of_determination(ys_orig,ys_line,n):          studentized_residuals=[]          y_mean_line = [mean(ys_orig) for y in ys_orig]          squared_error_regr = squared_error(ys_orig,ys_line)          stud_resid = (ys_orig - ys_line)/((squared_error_regr/(n-1))**0.5)          studentized_residuals.append(stud_resid)          squared_error_y_mean = squared_error(ys_orig,y_mean_line)          return 1 - (squared_error_regr/squared_error_y_mean), np.array(studentized_residuals, dtype=np.float64)           xs, ys = create_dataset(40,10,2,correlation='pos')          m,b = bestfit(xs,ys)   regression_line = [m*x + b for x in xs]  #predict_x = 8  #predict_y = m*predict_x + b  r_squared, studentized_residuals = Coefficient_of_determination(ys, regression_line,40) print(r_squared)   plt.scatter(xs,ys) #plt.scatter(predict_x,predict_y, color='g') plt.plot(xs, regression_line) plt.show() plt.scatter(regression_line,studentized_residuals) plt.show()",True
