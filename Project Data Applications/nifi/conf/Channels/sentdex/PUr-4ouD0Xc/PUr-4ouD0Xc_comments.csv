@pavanteja2966,2021-05-11T18:18:48Z,0,Hey dude .  I know asking this is irrelevant to the video context .  But I'm unable to understand recursion . And I'm unable to keep track of which line is getting executed . How the variables or data is maintained in stack for various calls .  Can you make a in depth on how to write recursively without  getting lost ? As this is your latest video . I'm hoping you would see this as there are less comments and I wouldn't end up down in the section .  Thanks  : ),True

@owenrooney3256,2021-05-10T19:04:32Z,2,"As others have mentioned, you're not only dropping everything longer than MAX_CHAR_LENGTH, but if you hit that length with substring even once in a file, you're also losing everything after that, because you're just building a longer and longer substring until the file ends. A simple way to work around that would be to empty the substring if you exceed MAX_CHAR_LENGTH, but if we're trying to extract the maximum number of good substrings that's still not quite perfect, because you may still lose valid substrings depending on how they're ordered. A better way to do this is to walk along slices of the list, adding the next item if it's too short and removing the first item in the slice if it's too long. Then join if it's the right length. So if a small block of code is followed by a large block of code and they don't fit together, it will still use the large block if it fits on its own.  YouTube doesn't like links, so I'll just attempt to paste an example I just threw together here. The formatting will probably be mangled, but fingers crossed:  def len_joined_strings(strings, sep):     # Should be better performing than ""len(sep.join(strings))""     return sum([len(s) for s in strings]) + max(0, (len(strings)-1)*len(sep))  def extract_good_substrings(string, sep, min_length, max_length, include_trailing_sep=False):     # Extract all non-overlapping substrings between min_length and max_length     split_string = string.split(sep)     good_substrings = []     n = 0     m = 1     while m < len(split_string):         current_substring_length = len_joined_strings(split_string[n:m], sep) + include_trailing_sep*len(sep)         if current_substring_length < min_length:             m += 1         elif current_substring_length > max_length:             n += 1         else:             substring = sep.join(split_string[n:m])             if include_trailing_sep:                 substring += sep             good_substrings.append(substring)             n = m             m = n + 1     return good_substrings  For your use-case, it should be: good_substrings = extract_good_substrings(fd, f""{NEWLINECHAR}{NEWLINECHAR}"", MIN_CHAR_LENGTH, MAX_CHAR_LENGTH, include_trailing_sep=True) Then you'd dump each of good_substrings to file. This likely isn't theoretically optimal, but I have a feeling that would require going down quite a deep rabbit hole to achieve.",True

@memespdf,2021-05-10T17:06:59Z,0,"Maybe a stupid question but since this is a programming language, tokenizers already exist.

@LetsDark,2021-05-10T15:55:56Z,36,"There are some problems with your dataset. 1. You don't handle the case where your substring gets longer then your max. In your code the substring will gobble the rest of the file and get out of scope without ever writing it to your file. Thats why you miss the end of the files. 2. I like the idea of the double new line splits, but wouldn't it be good to apply an auto-formatter first, so all files would have the same conventions? That would be better for the tokenizer too, I think.",True

@fynnsu,2021-05-10T15:38:41Z,2,The reason you're not getting more data is that you don't handle the case when len(substring) > Max char length. Therefore as soon as you add a split string that pushes Len(substring) > max char length all future split strings will be ignored. That's also why a lot of the data seems to start at the beginning of files only,True
