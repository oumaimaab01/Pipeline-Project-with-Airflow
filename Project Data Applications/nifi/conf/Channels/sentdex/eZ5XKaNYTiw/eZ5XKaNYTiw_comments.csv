@kenorb,2015-09-03T22:25:08Z,0,"Few side-notes. I think the safest way to gracefully restart the Apache would be: sudo apache2ctl graceful. It's useful to avoid any surprises when the whole httpd server goes down, because of some issues especially when you're working on multi-site environment. Other way to avoid caches is to add ?foo at the end, or forcing the refresh (CMD/Ctrl+Shift+R), otherwise you've to check the headers if it contains X-Cache (in Developers Tools/Inspect), if so, check which service is responsible for caching the invalid pages.",True
