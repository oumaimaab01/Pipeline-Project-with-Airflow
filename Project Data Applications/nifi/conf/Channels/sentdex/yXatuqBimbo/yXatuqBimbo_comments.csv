@tcraigscott,2016-03-02T02:21:11Z,0,"Great Video Series so far.  I am interested learning how you are using numpy to get the moving average using the repeat and convolution functions. I understand how I would calculate it, but what is the actually doing?",True
@violin6090,2014-11-21T23:53:34Z,0,How do you retain in mind those colour codes?! :-) Thanks for this clear awesome tutorials!,True
@knall0101,2014-11-06T21:11:00Z,0,"I also have the same problem you have when adding [-SP:] to newAr, where the volume dosent line up with the graf, you can see this at time 6:53 im sorry to bother you again, but it kinda got stuck in my mind :)) Thx for the tutorials ! They have helped me so much! Mr.Sentax is the man ! ",True
@knall0101,2014-11-06T17:52:56Z,0,"Hey i have a quik questing : When i get the graf up its all good, but when i start to pan(drag) around the graf it gets realy laggy, om on osx thx",True
@colin8110,2014-07-07T20:06:53Z,0,"Hey, Sentdex. I want to be able to see the calculations for the SMA import you use in this tutorial. I've been searching though the sub-files and cant figure out where it comes from. Is there a way that you can run a script or something that will identify the file location? I was hoping to see how it's programmed in so that I can start to get a feel for how the calculations work. The goal, eventually,  is to create a ADX for my plotting program. Thanks. ",True
@kkid12296,2014-05-03T21:58:13Z,1,"Hi Mr. sentdex, thanks for these videos. I have been trying to follow along and make a legend but keep on getting the following error:  Warning (from warnings module):   File ""C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\axes.py"", line 4486     warnings.warn(""No labeled objects found. "" UserWarning: No labeled objects found. Use label='...' kwarg on individual plots  The graph appears but the legend does not whenever I run the code. Do you have any ideas of what I can do to fix this problem? Thanks.",True
@antoniozeus4,2014-03-08T19:53:38Z,0,do the weekend gaps bother you? I noticed that typically these gaps don't appear on graphs and technically throw off the moving averages slightly.. what's your take on it.,True
@Barcelona281,2013-10-10T21:37:06Z,0,"ax1.plot(date[-SP:], Av2[-SP:] , '#e1edf9', label = label2, linewidth=1.5)  u`ve done it perfectly on point :D thank you and sory for so much disturbing :D",True
@Barcelona281,2013-10-10T21:30:58Z,0,"        Av1 = movingaverage(closep, MA1)         Av2 = movingaverage(closep, MA2)          label1=str(MA1)+' SMA'         label2=str(MA2)+' SMA'  I have it like this , does not seem the situtation ., maybe I have it wrong in other part :D ",True
@Barcelona281,2013-10-10T21:28:32Z,0,"yes , you`re perfectly right :D , I had the datetetime only ",True
@sentdex,2013-10-10T14:39:08Z,0,"in their respective plots, did you label=label1 and label=label2. If so, also check your definitions of label1 and label2, make sure they are indeed corresponding to av1 and av2.",True
@sentdex,2013-10-10T14:37:48Z,0,"Hey, that's actually more likely to be because it fails something, then gets to a sleeping function where you've not defined time.   Look @ the top of your script's imports and make sure you have ""import time"" there. If you insert an invalid color, but we made a try and except loop there, so then it'd continue on to the sleep and then break there.",True
@Barcelona281,2013-10-10T10:33:55Z,0,"Hi  Harrison,  my legend shows the same name for the 2 averages , do you know why  it could be ?",True
@Barcelona281,2013-10-10T10:00:12Z,0,interesting that by insertig the wrong code of the collor( #eledf9 & #e1edf9 )it was giving me a time error      ´´´ time.sleep(1)      NameError: name 'time' is not defined. ´´  just for those who are in the same issue : ),True
