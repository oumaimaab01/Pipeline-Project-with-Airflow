@firstpagemarketing,2015-08-18T20:02:04Z,1,The Aroon Indicator works well with companies with an F-Score of 8 or higher. Buy when red falls and green rises. It will form an X. Sell when the second X appears green falls red increases. 8/9 of the following FScore readings. 1)A rise in net income 2)A rise in operating cash flow 3) A rise in return on Assets 4)A rise in working capital 5)A rise in gross margin 6)Operating cash flow greater than company's net income. 7)Ratio of long term debt to assets has fallen. 8) growth rate of sales exceeds that of the asset acquisition. 9) Company has not diluted the value of the stock.   I am not an expert and my advice is to educate how in general this indicator is usually most effective. Invest  using this strategy at your own risk.  However  the charts that he shows shows company's that at the time had a good F-Score.  Generally  people who trade using indicators are considered to be Technical Analysis. However  with most of these indicators they work best on fundamentally sound company's. Which is why sentdex see's that  it worked well predicting the trends. It will work less and give false readings to company's with lower points on the FScore . i'm actually studying this in hopes to learn how to screen for this myself using python. Most stock screeners that feature the FScore  in the screener are expensive with monthly charges.    As well if you want to master anything  first practice then study it but the 3rd major  point is to teach.  So I share this advice.,True
