@bobsavage3317,2023-03-26T15:58:46Z,0,"You mention the ""System"" parameter, and you had a problem where ChatGPT responded with ""Great!"" when you didn't want it to be conversational. As I understand it, the System parameter will be a pre-prompt that can be used to effect the persona that flavors ChatGPT's responses (as well as limiting the kinds of questions you can ask). In other words, I think you can use System to improve the response to get rid of ""Great!"" and possibly even to return HTML as you mention at one point.",True
@Chigaijinn,2023-03-26T12:52:16Z,0,"Another awesome vid, thanks! I was thinking, why even limit to options instead of letting the user type what they want to do next and make it completely open ended? The generative properties make this kind of interactive game possible for the first time.",True

@jonathan-._.-,2023-03-25T00:48:25Z,0,i guess it would be a good idea to validate the output of the ai very rigously (i.e. only numbers in Option [0-4]) and if anything doesnt match just regenerate the response i would also probably try to let the image generation just do a few more attempts if it fails before using the backup,True
