@dimtass,2019-06-26T11:01:51Z,0,"Just be aware of the toxic emittions when you print in a room that you're working. There are many studies that confirm these toxic emittions that you can have a look. The more simple solution is just leave the window open and be in another room while printing. But here are also some DIY enclosures with filters. Filtering is also quite difficult because the particles are very small for most of the filters, so again you might need a tube that pushes the air out of the room.  Anyway, just have a look at it, because most of the times is not mentioned that 3d printing can have some dangers.",True

@mikerhinos,2019-05-14T17:27:26Z,0,"I have the CR10S Pro . I tried a lot of solutions to have good adhesion, and I'm not a fan of heating the bed because it pumps a lot of energy (there are many videos with guys measuring electric consumption with and without heating bed), and not really usefull for PLA anyway. The best that I found : autolevel (if your printer can) your bed on EACH power on. I have a glass bed, inductive sensor, anti backlash nuts, and I STILL have to do it, and adjust height by -0.2 in Cura at start of print. My next mod is replacing the inductive sensor with a Touch Mi because going from capacitive to inductive didn't change anything with me...  Put good quality glue stick, no heat bed, and you're good to go.  For your cup, in preview mode in Cura once you sliced the model, look at the 4-5 first layers by moving the slider down on the right of screen, I guess that you must have tiny gaps printing in 0.2, you could test in 0.1 or even 0.16 which is a multiple of 4 (better for the stepper motors).  If you plan of having food or water in your prints, I guess that you're using PLA, it's better to use PETG.  If you already know all that sorry :D It could be useful for someone else :p",True

@frankbank2425,2019-05-14T06:52:56Z,0,"Not sure if you already got an answer but a few things that could help: the layer hight (so the thickness of the slices your printer prints with) seems to be quite close to the thickness of your cups bottom. This will result in a lot of gaps since not every line the printer lays down fuses to the one next to it (not even on a perfectly calibrated machine). A possible fix would be to just go down in layer height meaning not 0.3mm (which I'm guessing you were using but possibly all the way down to 0.1mm. This will make the print take three times as long but also make it more water right. The other option would obviously be to just design the cup with a thicker bottom.  Other ways to make it hold water better would be to increase the extrusion multiplier. Secondly it seemed like, although it is hard to tell, you are printing too hot (but again hard to tell on camera with white filament)",True

@jeevan22293,2019-05-14T01:10:51Z,0,"You need more layers on the bottom, basically add more thickness. Since you have a raft it takes a away very small chunks of plastic when you pull it off. That's causing the leak I'm guessing, adding 2mm to the bottom will fix that. Also, your need to get the nozzle closer to the bed, a feeler guage is the best way I know, or use a sheet of paper. I personally never use rafts because of how much more work they are to get off clean and the extra time in print. If you get the bed levelling right most of the initial learning print you do won't need a raft.",True

@IntrepidProtoworks,2019-05-14T00:10:22Z,0,"I don't mean to be spammy on your comments. For checking how something will print, X-Ray is helpful. However, looking at the layer height view is really helpful. So, you look at each layer with your layer height in mind. Often, doing so will reveal issues.   Another non-exclusive issue is that your bottom layer could be too close to the plate which will result in a few layers above being 'squished' resulting in the bottom being a little too thin. It is hard to tell from the video if that is the issue though.  A video series on 3D printing and modeling for prototyping using Fusion 360 is something I have been wanting to do for  a while.

@DeadByProxy,2019-05-14T00:06:54Z,0,"I don't know the cura specific settings as I use Slic3r PE mainly but it could be number of solid top/bottom layers or infill percentage.   If there are gaps between perimeters or lines then it might be a slight underextrusion, depending on filament I have had to change my extrusion multiplier between 0.95 and 1.1.     Also you should be able to get the first layer to adhere without a raft if you're using PLA, might need to adjust first layer height and/or 1st layer print speed(again not sure what these are in cura). Rafts are usually used for ABS to prevent warping or to add stability to prints with unusual geometry or small footprints, I tend to avoid them as the ""bottom"" print quality doesnt normally look as nice when using a raft.

@IntrepidProtoworks,2019-05-14T00:00:16Z,2,"If you print right onto glass with PLA, the temp in the room has to be slightly higher than room temp, and the glass has to be REALLY clean. The filament also typically needs to not have much moisture in it.  However, I do not really recommend printing right onto the glass, making sure it works is well, more work than I want to do.   If I am using glass, hair spray or a glue stick works really well. For glue stick, you want the cheapest stuff you can find like from the dollar store. You really just are looking for a glue stick made of only glycerin paste.   If you want to go the hair spray route, the best hair spray I have used is the  Garnier Fructis Style Extreme Control 5. Make sure to not spay it near the printer as it tends to gum stuff up.  In any of the above situations, make sure to clean your print surface often.    I do not really like using tape as it requires more work. There are other options out there which work well but these are the ones I like the most.  For additional glass surfaces. You can buy precision thickness stuff. Though, you can also go cheap and just use something like the glass out of Wal-Mart picture frames for cheap. The down side is that the glass is not super uniform and that can harm print quality.  However, it is cheap and it works. I have had it happen where I had to get a project done a number of times and had the surface break, so cheap and accessible sometimes wins the day.",True
