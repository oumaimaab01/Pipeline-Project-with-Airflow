@omgitsRC,2020-10-03T16:51:52Z,1,"you can put a median sort of imaginary protruding line from the scooter which denotes the scooter's direction(which could literally be perpendicular to the lower horizontal edge of the screen ) and trace the yellow pixels from the 'centerline' and make a line out of those pixels.   now parallel'ize(not a word),  median and centerline.

@GeneralPet,2020-06-16T20:23:33Z,0,Could you train a CNN to return the edges of the road? When fully trained it would be road detection with convolutions. I really like the idea of having multiple networks interacting with each other,True

@festro1000,2019-10-15T06:45:54Z,0,Know I'm late but have you tried dropping the grayscale and having the image identify the lanes by color and shape? Since most of the freeway lanes are yellow and mostly straight. not a programmer myself but seems easier than superposing a bunch on lines on a grayscale image and hoping for it to connect the right lines.,True
@XxJokyxX,2019-05-03T17:21:35Z,0,"haven't watched the other episodes yet, but i think filtering the lines by the best positive slope line, and the best negative slope line would find the lanes, if you fall out of lane might be a problem though, but i believe it could work :P",True

@hamishsams6940,2018-11-28T14:30:10Z,0,Would you not be better using a sobel Y line detector so you can detect lines better the more vertical they are as your lanes should always be more vertical.,True
@Tibetan-experience,2018-11-11T16:53:12Z,12,"dose anyone gets annoyed by the machine learning Ads from YouTube, knowing that santdex is the best ? feels like someone is asking me to exchange gold with sliver.",True
@emin86,2018-11-07T10:21:18Z,0,"A little late but: For straight lane marker detection, you can filter the lines according to perspective. Look for a line on the left side of the screen with a specific positive m (slope, going up from left to right) and on the right side of the screen look for a line with a negative m (slope, going down from left to right). The m can be in ranges. This way the lane detection has to be started on a lane between lines and would fail if you start it next to the road.",True

@vidflop,2018-03-13T21:22:45Z,32,I wish you could record all the modifications in this video instead of showing directly the ready codebase. I just lost you in this episode. btw I'm a beginner in Python and ML. So confused...,True

@CO8ism,2018-02-22T18:43:25Z,0,using polar coordinates to parametrize the lines instead of m and b actually fixes some of the problems that you're having with infinite slopes.,True

@Farid-ik7yq,2017-08-18T01:19:58Z,11,I noticed that if you don't convert original image to grayscale in the beginning of process_img() function just before cv2.Canny call yellow lane lines will be detected more often,True
@shimuk8,2017-07-30T19:57:40Z,11,"Hey Harrison !! I think i have a better approach for the line detection ( even though it's too late I was busy watching your neural network videos :'D ) Instead of using edge detectors and drawing lines for the whole screen.. why don't you just put a ROI in the left side of the scooter approx. x - 300 y - 200 ( first coordinate ) and over there drawing a small rectangle ROI just to detect if the middle yellow road marker is going left or right. It will keep the vehicle close to the yellow line and in the middle of the road also and it's a little easy i guess. I am actually implementing this on a rather similar gta 5 like game watch dogs 2.  But anyway, I gotta say you just made my entire summer vacation just too awesome !! Learned basics, cv2, ML and now this !! Thank you soo much, from India !!!! :')",True
@pranshurokz,2017-07-03T15:11:18Z,1,"@sentdex for the final two lines...why don't you just take into account the distance between the two lines to deal with the case where both the lines are on the same side . you can keep a minimum distance value between the two lines , while comparing slopes, to avoid same lane being the the two lines",True

@DaVince21,2017-05-20T07:55:07Z,2,"I'm a little late and you might have figured this out yourself by now, but wouldn't the double line be pretty useful for determining that you're on the right lane or the left one?",True
@martinbreyton5679,2017-05-19T12:27:47Z,1,"Hello, why don't you make sure that slopes of the two main lanes are of the opposite sign ? shouldn't that exclude the cases where they look in in the same direction ?",True
@shilpajbhalerao6641,2017-05-09T06:22:32Z,1,Have u tried using contours? U can easily get lanes by using cv2.findcontours and cv2.drawcontours in ROI and it will also work good for curve lanes.,True

@Jamer1Smith,2017-04-30T00:09:29Z,0,You should use Java or C to process the image (making lines) and Python for the neural network only. Python is awful processing images.,True

@calder-ty,2017-04-11T06:01:59Z,3,"Great Series Harrison! I know you're past this, but another idea for a (in my opinion) simpler rule for staying within the lane is to have scooter try to maximize the distance from both lines. If there is only one, it will try to move away from it and find the other. if they are both there then the middle will maximize the distance between both.",True
