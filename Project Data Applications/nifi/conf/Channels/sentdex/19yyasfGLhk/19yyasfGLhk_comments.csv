When you do the 10 day candlestick summation (for high, low, open and close), you used each day's Adj Close as the source data. This is an easy way for showcase coding purposes and I do appreciate the simplified illustration in the video. :-)   But in fact, 10-day candlestick summation should use the first day's ""adj open""(not adj close) for the 10-day candlestick ""open"", and the max of each day's ""high"" (rather than max of each day's adj close) as 10-day ""high"". Similarly, the minimum of each day's ""low""(not minimum of each day's Adj close) is the real 10-day candlestick low.   Otherwise, we will never get the same identical candlestick to the ones showed on stock websites.",True

@robfullerton6298,2017-01-18T03:55:18Z,42,"In case anyone else is confused about the .ohlc() aggregation (I was at first): Because only the adj_close slice of the dataframe is being used, I believe it's calculating the ohlc of only the close values per 10 days.  The actual opens, or intra-day high or low points could have been outside those high-low ranges.  That's an Important distinction if someone is planning to use this to source data for an actual strategy.  P.S. The alternative is too complicated for this tutorial and would involve taking the ratio of close/adj_close and using it to create adj_open, adj_high, adj_low columns, then aggregating them ""manually"".
