Here's a few tips that worked for me and hopefully will work for someone else struggling to get their game up and running.  I'm using python 3.4.1 with corresponding pygame, cx_Freeze 5.0.1 which was just released jan 2017.  I couldn't tell you about other versions of other things, this is what I did with what I have.  These changes were made in my main.py  1)I changed the starter lines to include other modules as well as initialize fonts so it now looks like this:          import pygame          import time          import random          import re          from pygame.locals import *                 pygame.init()          pygame.font.init()  2)  Anywhere I needed to call fonts were changed to this and be sure to only have the ' ' instead of "" "" when surrounding the font types with the number being whatever size fits your display the way you want  pygame.font.SysFont('verdana', 72)  Again, I'm not exactly sure yet why this cleared everything up.  My errors that I kept getting included os not reading the font, segmented file errors, implementation errors, etc....pretty much all described below.  Hope this helps at least 1 person!  I'm off to start the next in the series....great job again sentdex I'm still with you!",True

@haydosm,2015-05-26T04:55:13Z,0,"Hey, I really enjoyed the video and it helped me out so much but I do have one issue. My program is built into an .exe file, however similarly to your issue with the fonts, when I opened it, it got an error and closed again. The error is as follows: code = importer.get_code (moduleName) zipimport.ZipImportError: can't find module ""it's my forte v0.35 safety__main__"" I am guessing that somehow the file is unable to find my code named ""It's My Forte V0.35 Safety.py"" or however it sees it. It would be great if you could help.Â  Some things, I am using a 64-bit python 3.3 (I had started this project before python 3.4 came out) and the relevant pygame 3.3 64 bit. This was obtained as a prerelease or something though, and was the only one compatible with my python version. Everything was fine up until a similar point of your font issue",True
