@0xsuperman,2015-04-18T17:09:11Z,0,Thanks for the great series. I wonder if #12 is the last of the series at the moment?,True
@dengan699,2015-03-21T23:50:35Z,0,"man, I appreciated your first videos, but then I had some feeling that you are simply trying to promote your website and your ""sentiment index"", more than teach people to do sth valuable....Sure, that's just some quick videos, but I really think you should spent more time on stats: I stopped at 6th lesson and then I just went trhou 5 next rapidly, but I didn't see you transforming your timeseries to log-returns to get rid of heterescedasticity, or comparing % of success trades for the strategy or whatever etc.....  That's great for learning Pandas, but definitly not for investing  For those interested, I would highly recommend the book ""Quantitative Trading with R: Understanding Mathematical and Computational Tools from a Quant's Perspective"", absolutly great book, woth every $ and hour you spend on it",True
