@jnevercast,2022-10-14T02:06:43Z,0,"Presumably the vocoder trained on the sound of your voice, but didn't really have a dataset of the words you said?   Under the condition that this presumption is correct, I wonder if the synthesis quality would be improved with fully classified audio. i.e. supervised fine-tuning rather than just learning pitch/phonetic parameters",True

@KylePapili,2022-09-26T15:05:58Z,49,Crazy how much improvement we've seen already in this speech synthesis model. Would be interesting to plot out quality over time and estimate how long it will be before the speech synthesis model can fool your average viewer!,True
