@FreeER,2015-01-19T22:38:09Z,1,"sentdex  Do you realize that s.connect() does not actually return a connection (or any other) object? The close method is defined on the socket itself. so it should be s.close(), alternatively you could use the with statement eg. with s: s.connect((server, port))  P.S. it seems like you should close the socket prior to attempting to acquire the print_lock considering that it blocking could cause a delay in releasing the socket. Though probably an entirely unnecessary observation considering the number of available sockets and the low chance of the block being for any significant amount of time.  P.P.S. Glad I found your videos :)",True
