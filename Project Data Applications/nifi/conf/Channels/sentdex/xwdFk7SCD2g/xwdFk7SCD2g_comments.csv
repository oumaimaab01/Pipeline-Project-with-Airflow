@kristoferkrus,2021-06-28T02:12:42Z,0,"Very nice series! However, one thing that I wish you would have covered immediately when you started to render the faces in varying colors is how to make sure that surfaces farther away from the camera are not rendered on top of surfaces closer to the camera. For example, in the cubes, you still often see the faces that are on the backside of the cube. How can you fix that?",True

@MACHINEBUILDER,2019-05-04T21:13:19Z,1,"Just wondering, how can you specify to OpenGL to not draw backfaces? Is that a thing that's possible?...

Because I really want to make some 3D engine but this weird rendering is putting me off...",True

@scorchbrand4726,2018-09-24T10:47:21Z,0,"Not sure if you or anyone else still sees these comments, being so old but I have two questions.  First: How do you make a shape other than a cube in 3D? Everything I see so far is only for 2D and most of them are using way different code than what you went over.  Second, and more important: Is it possible to draw several different shapes at different locations? And if so, how please. I have an idea about a spinning top that crashes into things. I figured out how to make the cube into a rectangular prism that resembles a cone but that is not exactly what I need.   Any help or even tips to find this would be greatly appreciated.",True
