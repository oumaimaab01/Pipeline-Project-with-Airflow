@christovanwyk1348,2022-01-24T17:01:48Z,0,Is there a faster way to sort? Like let's say there is a very big dictionary with 1000s of key value pairs. How would you make the sorting faster?,True

@strawberryyogurt0,2020-02-27T02:20:11Z,0,"Vid: 2013 . My comment: 2020 ... For anyone, even though Dictionaries are classified as unordered, and people on stackoverflow says you can’t order them and acts as if question doesn’t make sense,  if you look at the key/value pairs (when both ‘numbers’ or ‘letters’ are used for key/value) why would anyone say you can’t order a dictionary? Numbers 0123456789,10,11, etc ... Letters abcdefghi, etc, both are in a specific order otherwise we would be counting numbers starting from 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 9, etc. or the alphabet starting from d, b. F, z, y, etc. The desire to order the dictionary in a way we’ve been taught from childhood is exactly what we want to do. Why do so many people on stackoverflow act as if they don’t know what the user wants to do when he/she ask how to sort the dictionary in a specific order. Even though dict(sorted(Dict_original)) does not put the sorted dict key/value pair in sorted dict format, the question of wanting to know how to sort a dictionary still makes sense.",True
@george480,2019-10-26T23:18:31Z,0,Everyone said that this is a life saver and I will repeat. I had 24 line messy code to do the same thing that you did in 2 lines. Thank you!!!,True
@Leon-xg7zj,2019-08-19T13:34:01Z,1,dict.items() returns a list of tuples len(dict) returns the size of dict “key=lambda t:t[0]” is not necessary can also add “reverse = True”,True
@pannapan5727,2019-05-11T09:34:20Z,2,Can you plz give me the link of your lambda tutorial? couldnt find it,True
@avnishrai01,2018-12-03T17:22:56Z,0,thanks a lot man i was trying to do it in different way by making key value assigned to third value and then assigning it to orignal value and it didnt work  and i wasted my 2 hr in it  thanks once again,True

@martynasjuravicius678,2018-07-09T13:10:28Z,4,"If you want dictionary, you can use Comprehensions: return {key: value for key, value in sortedByKeyDict} and return {key: value for key, value in sortedByValueDict} in the end of functions. It will return dictionary.",True
@aminvogue,2018-02-07T11:36:32Z,1,"Hi I am glad u posted tis vdo as I was looking for an easy way to do sort .

@enjoyinglife671,2017-03-05T22:38:32Z,1,How about making a dictionary which will order the elements by the order key/value pairs are added to them?  I know  OrderedDict does that but not sure how to use it,True
@Darkcreeper555,2016-12-04T23:15:43Z,0,The video is great but the output of the code is a list of memory addresses. So I cannot turn into type dict again. Is there a way around this? I'm really struggling,True
@upamanyuray3131,2016-06-05T23:31:50Z,0,"Thank you so much for the video. I have a problem    I have a text file like this :  1 1 4.59114 0.366832 -9.56424   2 1 5.24742 -0.870574 -8.40649   3 2 5.21995 -0.38856 -7.39145   4 3 6.43785 -1.20272 -8.77666   5 1 7.53694 -0.0740336 -8.86134   27 2 7.64588 0.464146 -7.88774   28 1 7.07087 0.831361 -9.94761   29 2 6.96326 0.260853 -10.9003   32 1 5.77529 1.52588 -9.63533   33 2 5.82876 2.05648 -8.67551   34 3 5.45996 2.478 -10.7567   35 2 4.47197 2.81668 -10.674   36 1 4.26389 -2.0756 -8.48939   37 2 3.21056 -1.72474 -8.29007   38 3 4.41887 -2.73285 -9.80971   39 2 3.67915 -3.47532 -9.87803   40 2 4.42807 -2.7596 -7.63859   41 3 3.54752 0.821914 -9.09022   42 2 4.44697 -0.0904811 -10.564   31 2 8.07781 2.54128 -9.38259   Now I want to sort it in 2 steps :  a) First by using the second column, all the rows having 1, 2 or 3 will be together. SO it will look something like this:  1 1 4.59114 0.366832 -9.56424   2 1 5.24742 -0.870574 -8.40649   32 1 5.77529 1.52588 -9.63533   5 1 7.53694 -0.0740336 -8.86134   and so on...  3 2 5.21995 -0.38856 -7.39145  27 2 7.64588 0.464146 -7.88774   31 2 8.07781 2.54128 -9.38259  and so on....  4 3 6.43785 -1.20272 -8.77666  38 3 4.41887 -2.73285 -9.80971   37 2 3.21056 -1.72474 -8.29007 and so on....  After that, I want to sort by using the third column. For example,  when the value in the 3rd column is between 2 to 5, all those rows will  be together,third columns having valuers will be together 5-9. . This  will happen for each of the 3 cases of the second column value being 1, 2  and 3.   Can someone please tell me how to achieve this? Sorry, it maybe  straightforward question but I am a beginner in python currently. Thank  you so much.",True
