@jasonmartineaux6492,2022-10-12T19:42:26Z,0,"I love your video the math is correct but only if your bet is fixed meaning let's say you are playing roulette and you decide, to bet only on red and continue to bet on red, that is the only way the theory and scale you are using works, but if you jump around with your bet placement there is no telling for sure if you will, in the end, finish with a profit or loss. so my point is if you develop a good bet placement strategy which I have many, I could use most of these math systems like martingale, and Labouchere, and turn out a profit, in the long run, .so to me there is no simulator that can accurately determine the true outcome of 100 spins or 1000 spins even in a coin flip. and there is non or not one casino game that is truly random, they are all designed by the casinos solely for the benefit of the casinos, and they are all bias to them.",True
@user-bd8cc8qw2h,2022-09-18T09:22:55Z,0,Congratulations on a great video! ðŸ‘¿ I know where you can get more than 7 free spins.Best choice. My husband hit the mega at Choctaw on a .88 cent bet. A man put about 500.00 in the machine and moved to another machine my husband decided to get on there and see what he could do on .88 bet and after about 30.00 into machine all the progressives went away and the mega opened up. Win 5100.00,True
@aa-qh6xm,2022-05-02T07:25:20Z,0,"Can you test reductionary betting systems? I see no discussion on them anywhere. I've had success with labouchre on baccarat but using it to reduce my bet, betting exclusively on player. For example, if my bet size is 50 dollars, I will write 5 5 5 5 on a paper, and when there's losses the system ""wins"" as I'm reducing my bet size and that benefits from the casino's edge. For example, I will cross off the two 5s and reduce my bet to 40 and capture a loss. The tricky part I see is reductionary betting can interfere with winning streaks, which could be a crucial part of the return. And when your bet gets down to  the table minimum (5 dollars for me on the stadium baccarat). Maybe this could be remedied by eating these missed out upon gains and lowering the base bet to try to overcome that if a nasty streak comes? I'm sure a simulation will show you can't overcome the edge for the casino built into the game. But could this possibly be the ""optimal"" way so to speak to play a negative casino game? Michael Shackleford says flat betting is the cheapest way but I want to see if this would yield anything interesting. I literally see it addressed nowhere except some obscure baccarat youtube channels where they really don't get into the math of it.",True

@danielkovacs1313,2021-05-04T15:42:01Z,0,"Actually, the Martingale system requires the less winning frequency, because it's enough if you win every 5th, 6th, 7th, or xth time. Unless you run out of your bankroll, which is a case that will surely happen sooner or later, if you use this system only.",True

Also as a gambler for 5 years I can tell you that you can't bet every time and win, you need to find the timing in the game. All the bets on the table games have timing for when you should bet, you just need to spend around five thousand hours like I have and figure it out. I've written down thousands of numbers from roulette and I can tell you it's not random, all tables no matter the bias have the same patterns.",True

@justinhunstad,2019-01-28T04:09:10Z,1,Use casino loyalty rewards cards in the equation.  Example. Every $100 wager gets you a return of $1 in loyalty rewards. Now aim your betting strategy to be lower than the loyalty rewards card.   Instead of $10 per $100 risked. Say I only want to make 50c per $100 at risk.  In theory wouldn't I come out ahead long term when taking into account loyalty bonus? Even with the occasionally .05% of the time I go bust and lose the full $100.  Wether it is worth the time investment is another discussion.,True

@JimmiNeytron,2017-11-13T03:15:51Z,0,"Appreciate your video. Can you make another one with using neural network approach to try predicting bet result? Neural networks are now widely used for many types of things like image processing, voice recognition, optical character recognition. If the gambling is not using pseudo random generator (we now that online gambling sites may fake the result) than it may has some logic. Let's just take right input params for neurons like total amount of users' chips and total gambling site profit for the one bet. We also may include previous 50 bet results as an input because these sites still try to make the bet history look in a realistic way. It's really interesting to investigate and may be profitable.

@user-hu9eg7ck9b,2014-12-09T03:19:23Z,1,"Thanks for the video. I enjoyed it. Very good explanations and presentation overall. People have often suggested I gamble, but it had never made any intuitive sense to me. Now I have something to point to.  A few comments about your code though:  The reason the wins and losses were not working was because you initialized them again at the start of every run of the function.  Also, in python 3+ you don't need to float stuff to get a float. broke_count/total_plays*100 would work perfectly. (If you want to get python 2 style division you can use the // operator instead: 12 / 5 == 2.4, but 12 // 5 == 2)  You forgot the [1, 2, 2, 3, 2] run!
