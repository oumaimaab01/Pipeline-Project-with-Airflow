@mohammedfelioune4883,2019-07-21T14:03:18Z,0,I cannot plot the data from the link you are using please any help regarding this point,True
@markd964,2018-07-22T18:26:11Z,0,"caution with moving averages here! -  using the datafile https://pythonprogramming.net/yahoo_finance_replacement (because Yahoo finance API defunct), this datafile runs from most recent (@date[1] to oldest (@date[4420]) DATES.  Although the MA calcs are correct, I think this is causing the moving averages (as coded in video) to be displayed 'out of sync' with price data, because the 'start' param as defined is incorrect, as the data is 'starting at the right of the plot, not the left, at incorrect dates. Can verify easily on a quick Excel plot of the data. If you are using these MAs for trading entry/exits - caution. perhaps someone can verify? Am happy to be corrected. (Superb videos by the way - THX!)",True
@kamilziemian995,2018-02-21T16:30:09Z,2,"Maybe I am just too pedantic. I think that this video should have a title ""Matplotlib Tutorial 21 - Adding more indicator data to our charts"".",True
@Locke19901,2017-08-30T17:18:12Z,3,That is one hell of a way to get a MA!,True
@sukumarhonkote9936,2017-06-24T13:22:29Z,0,How to add a common x axis to the plot? In this case the MA plot is moving to the left as the first 30 days are ignored.,True
@SkielCast,2017-03-07T22:22:18Z,3,"I believe the high_minus_low function can be easily rewritten to work with list this way:  def high_minus_low(highs, lows):     return [i-j for i,j in zip(highs,lows)]",True

@brade770,2015-08-24T14:07:49Z,0,"I did get a very low number for my len(ma1)i.e. 2, and now even with the [-start:] fix, I'm getting ""x and y must have the same first dimension""...  I think I'm not understanding the overall concept though, otherwise perhaps I could've thought up my own handling fix by now.   Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/pnUH6Cpz  Could you offer any help? Thanks!  ...Oh, and thanks for all the great videos!!! =)",True
@rickdeckard1075,2015-08-12T03:22:20Z,1,"interesting...i'm researching the same process in FSharp... historical prices in CSV ->  to database (FSharp offers a SQL 'type provider'), live charting thru webquery,  custom indicators, winforms vs WPF etc etc - its also a point worth noting that MAs are just discrete forms of convolution integrals... and convolutions are continuous forms of moving averages etc",True
