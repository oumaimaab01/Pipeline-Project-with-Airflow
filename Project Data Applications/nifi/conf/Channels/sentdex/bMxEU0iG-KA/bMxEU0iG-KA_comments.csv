@nikunjparmar4256,2017-10-22T15:26:07Z,0,"[print(x,y) for x,y in zip(x,y)] is not right way to print things , it'll generate unwanted list of 'None' value like ['None' , 'None' , 'None' , 'None' ] . zip(x,y) will generate comma separeted values of tuple, so you can not use [print(x,y) for x,y in zip(x,y)], it's better to use [print(*i) for i in zip(x,y)]. Still don't use above mathod for printing anything.",True
@gillianbc,2017-10-05T06:25:15Z,0,Really good tutorial.  I came here as I'm doing a DataCamp python course (paid) that includes zip and your tutorial cleared everything up - for free!  Many thanks.,True

@RomaN23917,2017-01-14T11:28:19Z,0,"Hi, thanks for great tutorial. I just wanna say there's one more cool thing, where we can use zip. For example if need to split up a list, it can be done so: list(zip(*[iter(s)]*n))  >>> s = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 9] >>> list(zip(*[iter(s)]*2)) [(1, 2), (3, 5), (6, 7), (7, 9)]",True

@gardnmi,2016-11-10T15:40:39Z,36,Never knew that Python would overwrite your variable if you used it as an iterator.  I could see how that would lead to a bad day of debugging.,True
@Crider64152,2016-11-10T15:09:21Z,2,"Bounced on my boy's dick to this for hours.  Just curious, in what scenarios would you be using ZIP other than print? Like I love your tutorials and they are great for doing basic things like... wanting to print all the time... but like can you give a few examples of when you actually use the code to do something aside from print? Like, assume I'm completely ignorant, I'd only assume that intermediate python programming was about using different modules to print things different ways.  Not saying I don't love your vids, cuz I do, but some other examples would be NOOOICE.   George Bush did 9/11, the government is putting chemtrails in your cereal.",True
