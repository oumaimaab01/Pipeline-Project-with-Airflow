@DanKaschel,2021-11-30T14:43:52Z,2,"I just bought the textbook! This is a great series and is just the kind of ground-up education I was looking for.   One thing I'm struggling with in the textbook is that, in preparation for backpropogation, you spend a ton of time on mathematical fundamentals. As someone who hasn't touched calculus in 15 years, it's a slog and the mathematical notation is hard to get used to. I get that it's a necessary evil, but I don't think the textbook does a great job of contextualizing the information. In this video, I followed why random and incremental permutation were too inefficient, but I don't really follow how the derivative is used here.  I think I lack the intuition for what it means that the network can be represented as a single equation (probably because I'm used to thinking algorithmically). So, while I know what a derivative is, I don't really understand what it means to take a derivative of a neural network.   I expect all that will come with time, BUT it's a momentum killer to have all this hard-to-digest theory in an unfamiliar notation without a clear sense of how it will help.",True

@DRealHammer,2021-08-15T23:11:51Z,16,"edit: just noticed, someone already mentioned this, but maybe the explanation is appreciated by someone  Cool video, just a little inaccuracy: You mentioned at 8:16: ""this can only be done on a continuous curve, so no sharp corners""  I know this is an introduction but to clarify: a continuous function can have sharp corners. A better description for a continuous function would be that it should be "" connected"", so no parts, where it suddenly jumps from 1 to 0 without a connection. Someone gave an intuition like ""if you can draw it without lifting your pencil it's continuous. But there's a bit more to it.  what we want to look at are ""differentiable function"", so functions you can differentiate (or find a derivative). Does not help with understanding, but these are the functions with no sharp corners. All differentiable functions are continuous. So it is a stronger statement.  Examples: f(x) = x^2 is differentiable and hence also continuous  f(x) = abs(x) is continuous, but no differentiable (sharp corner at 0, as the function describes a V shape)  f(x) = 1, if 0 < x < 1; else 0 is not continuous, hence also not differentiable (we have value jumps at x = 0 and x = 1)",True
