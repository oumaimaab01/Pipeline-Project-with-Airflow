I already know some of the basics of python( i have done some projects that my family uses). I have one and half years of programming experience with c#. The main reason i would like to learn python, is to do a self-driving bot for Watch Dogs (if possible even code cheats and hacks for my single player games), so to make it short, what should i learn, where to start, is python better then c# for game hacking?

@idiocracy10,2018-10-27T22:17:00Z,1,"I made it to the tkinter stuff on your last basic python stuff,  I mean to finish it, but got distracted by some other tutorials.  A couple of suggestions.  If you can delve into your debug process for when you have logic errors.  Like how you step thru the code to see if it is actually doing exactly what you wanted it to do. I did a tutorial for the idle debugger that showed how to do this, and it was a big aha moment for me.  how to use help() or what equivalent you use to learn the native keywords, functions, dunders, etc.  and finally, this may not be basic but if you could thread some of it in if you get to doing somewhat complex scripts,  your algorithm process, or psuedo code.  I saw a great talk on this on one of millions of pycon talks on youtube, but the guy made the point that to start coding, you dont go to a computer and start typing, you go to a pencil and a paper and start writing the algorithm  first, trying to formalize it into psuedo code, then the actual coding is much simpler.         I think I would psuedo code, then type that up as comments, then start coding between the comments, once I get to scripts that are more than one function or one loop/nested loop in length.     The ""how to think like a programmer"" series is great for realizing some of the key strategies for going from a blank screen to start making headway on programming thru a problem.",True
