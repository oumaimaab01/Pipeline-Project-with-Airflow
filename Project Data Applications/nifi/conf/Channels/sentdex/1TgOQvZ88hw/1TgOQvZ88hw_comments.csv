@AG-cx1ug,2022-01-25T13:21:53Z,0,"Why do we need that while x < 100: loop to run simple_bettor 100 times? When we don't add the if value < 0: function, simple_bettor runs 100 times, but with it, it doesn't. Shouldn't it run wager_count times anyway since the while loop in the simple_bettor function says that? Thank you!",True

@skadoosh550,2019-11-04T02:09:09Z,0,"When I set wager_count == 10000 my program outputs many negative funds for each 1 of the 100 bettors as expected. However, only some of the negative funds are considered ""broke"". Why aren't all the negative funds considered ""broke""? If any of you guys have a solution, please let me know. I am using the latest version of Python, perhaps that is the problem?",True

@aGianOstaLgia,2015-09-09T16:52:49Z,2,"at 1:11 , how is it possible that all funds are  k *200 and not even one of them is k*200 +100 ? I mean after all the bet is 100 and 50% should be ending in 100 or 300 etc...  Please explain this , if you have the time. Thanks for the tutorial!",True
@georgepamfilis2983,2014-04-06T11:56:13Z,0,or is every x a bettor and each bettor has to go through all the wager_count 's untill the next x thank you,True
@georgepamfilis2983,2014-04-06T11:36:05Z,0,"hi, i placed a print x at x = 0 while x < 100:     simple_bettor(10000,100,1)     x+=1     print x  and it gives me  Funds:  10100 1 Funds:  9900 2 Funds:  9900 3  but when i change thhe simple_bettor simple_bettor(10000,100,2)  it gives me  Funds:  9900 Funds:  9800 1 Funds:  10100 Funds:  10000 2 Funds:  10100 Funds:  10200 3  did i just create two bettors where they change rebet or am i making a mistake because if i were to put simple_bettor(10000,100,100) it will give i think 10000 result 100 per betting round is this right ? thank you",True
