@fast_harmonic_psychedelic,2021-05-31T05:29:03Z,0,Typically it is to(device). You do it weird with the to('cuda')  because normally in pytorch you do device = torch.device('cuda:0')  and then later .to(device)  when you need a cuda instance.,True

@fast_harmonic_psychedelic,2021-05-31T05:05:31Z,0,"""import matplotlib(space)""  should be ""import matplotlib(nospace)""  thats why it returned it as ""import matplotlib   plt "" instead of ""as plt""",True
