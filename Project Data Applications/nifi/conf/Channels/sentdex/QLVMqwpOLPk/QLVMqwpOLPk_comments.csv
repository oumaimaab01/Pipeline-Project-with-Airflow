@manojdureja1069,2020-08-12T08:06:03Z,1,"Thanks sentdex for your videos. These are helping in implementing many algorithms. But, I would like to point out one thing:  In this video, one of fundamental reason why accuracy is so high is the use of linear regression on price data. This is not a right way forward if you want to actually trade. Essentially, ""accuracy"" here represents the correlation between prices and lagged prices (lag = 30 days). Correlation tracks deviation from mean.   Example: If a stock moves from say 400 to 1000 over 5 years. Say, mean is 700. Now, you take a data point for some day say 900, you predict (will be close to 900 obviously, very low probability of predicting below 700). Then, this prediction is counted as a very good prediction in the calculation of ""accuracy"" . Clearly, this does not add any value.  Correct way is to use returns of the stock and try and predict those.",True

I know that standardizing or normalizing the value features can affect the performance of some ML-algorithm, whether we should do it seems depends on what kind of ML-algorithm we adopted (i.e., it is better to standardizing value features when using ANN, but may not when using DT-related algorithm).  2) if we do need to standardize the value features, should we do it before encoding the categorical features or after? (I used to do a stupid way: first split the value and categorical features, then standardize the former ones and encode the latter ones, then concatenate them, is there a better way to do it?).  Again, thank you for this gorgeous tutorial",True

Also, training an SVR model instead using a linear kernel seemed to be giving the same level of accuracy, so I'm not sure where the issue lies in the video.   A final point, when making predictions using a model where the data was preprocessed before hand, we should also be preprocessing any new data to be classified with the SAME parameters. That is, we need to keep track of the mean and variance of the data the model was trained on, and then transform any new data with that particular mean and variance. You can do this using sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler as follows:  scaler = StandardScaler() scaler.fit(X)  # will store the mean and variance as attributes X_normalized = scaler.transform(X) # train your model with X_normalized # hack hack hack ... # Some new data X_predict appears!

Quick Q if I may: you're making predictions in this vid using data that has been scaled, but what do you do if you're using raw, live data to make a prediction? You can't scale a single sample, and surely if the classifier is trained on scaled data you'll get some funky predictions if you feed it unprocessed stuff. Is there a way to scale a single sample relative to the classifier (particularly if you're loading from a pickle)? Thanks again!",True
@paulkwok2233,2016-09-03T13:44:03Z,0,Can I use the CLF to predict more than 30 days forecast. I think the example here is not forecast the price for future. (there is a little bit confusing),True
@PhantomKenTen,2016-08-24T00:17:30Z,8,clf.predict(X_lately) works fine; however he prediction doesn't start from the current data. There is a gab on the graph. Do you know the reason for that?,True
@minjun87,2016-08-17T21:36:55Z,45,"Sentdex, sorry to say this but, it is not a prediction to the one month future. At the last step, when you plot them, you made a mistake. df['Adj. Close'] runs from the first row to the ""-30"" row of the original dataframe. It is 30 days shorter than the original dataframe because of df.dropna(inplace=True) right before you define 'y' in order to make the X len and y len the same. And the ""forecast set"" should run from the very next date of the last date of the original dataframe and 30 days from that date.   What you plot is: shorter dataframe's Adj. Close + df[Forecast_set] What you should have plotted is: original dataframe's Adj. Close + df[Forecast_set] Because what you have predicted is the whole new next 30 days.  Please check with it and give me some feedback on this. I appreciate it.",True

@trench6118,2016-05-16T23:15:09Z,0,"Hello - I had a question about incorporating the Day of Month (1 - 31) and the Weekday (Mon-Sun) into machine learning and how I would shape the data. At a glance, it is apparent that values in my data are lower towards the end of the month and Mondays have the highest values in general. I would like to use this historical data and test for these relationships and predict future values.  Since I am interested in future values based on the date, I assume that that the date would be my label. For features I would have my value column,  but maybe I would need 5 separate columns for the values per weekday? Or maybe even (5 weekdays * 31 days) of columns if I want to look at the weekday and the day of month? I hope that my description is clear.",True

@nrh013,2016-05-05T03:08:48Z,5,"+sentdex  Just another important observation. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the script doesn't answer the ""problem"" that you intended to answer. When you shift by ""forecast_out"" days, you are NOT predicting the price FOR THE NEXT number of ""forecast_out"" days, but instead you are predicting the price at T + number of forecast_out days.  So basically, if forecast_out = 5, the code as it is says that if I want to predict the price tomorrow, then I should look at the features 5 days ago.  The plot should have the ""label"" (not the ""Adj. Close"") and the forecast.",True
