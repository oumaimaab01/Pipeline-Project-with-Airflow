@davee4480,2017-04-29T04:21:50Z,1,"Hello. Nice tutorial. I have a Convolutional Neural Network that classifies pictures of cats and dogs but I cannot get it to run on my laptop as the GPU is not good enough. I tried to run on AWS but it was too confusing. Thankfully due to your video I've finally connected to a server on Google Cloud. Can you tell me what code I need to a) upload my folders containing the images, as well as to upload my python script to the server and b) what I need to type to get the python script to execute i.e. train on those images, and most importantly, c) how can I download the end product i.e. the trained model and execute it locally on my laptop on the test set?  I'd really appreciate any guidance you can offer here as I'm drawing a blank when searching online - you need to be very well-versed in Linux coding to do this I think! I've seen a lot of people asking this question online and receiving overly technical answers! I'm very new to coding and machine learning and its frustrating me that now I've built this model I can't actually execute it. Thanks for any advice you can give :)",True

@DrDherp,2017-03-21T16:35:33Z,1,"Could machine learning be used to search for anomalies in video frames? One issue being that the video is somewhat chaotic - imagine video of the back of a boat while in motion. Steady state, but chaotic. The other issue is that I can not train it on exactly what to look for. We know something is happening and we suspect it is perceptible on video (and unfortunately this is only a suspicion - there may be no signature at all on video). So basically I would ask the AI, ""tell me when something looks different than the rest"" instead of ""tell me when [this] occurs"".   Any thoughts on that? Maybe a link or a series you have already done?  Is ML even a good way to go about this task?",True
