@jacobdarby4056,2015-09-02T05:09:28Z,1,Hey sentdex i have been trialing many different user interfaces with python and was wondering if you had any idea which one can give the most slick modern look. I was using Tkinter for a bit but the interface just looked so dated in your opinion which one would you suggest? I'm trying to design a interface that would look similar to Facebook by the way :) Thanks,True
@sentdex,2015-08-14T02:27:26Z,3,"+statikreg Unfortunately I have no reply option for you, and you desperately need to be replied to. Regardless, wxPython IS a wrapper. Don't want to listen to me, how about wikipedia? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython You can also look at the main website: http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/overview_python.html and read ""This topic was written by Robin Dunn, author of the wxPython wrapper.""  It sounds like you don't know what a wrapper is, or the way they work. They do work actually a lot like an interpreter, much like the Python interpreter works for you. I did not call wxPython a python interpreter, I was explaining what a wrapper is and does, saying it works a lot like an interpreter does, and that is also true. I have been known to say wrong things in the past, but this isn't one of those times. People make mistakes, get over it, just like I'll get over your mistake. You should try to not be so rude until you really confirm your beliefs though, a simple google search would have saved you from being a e-jerk.  In regards to the first edit: Bit version == Architecture. I mean come on man... you're wrong on every point so far. If you need me to, I can show you a real video where I say the wrong thing if it'll help you vent some steam.  In regards to the 2nd edit: Despite you being wrong on all counts so far, this video is over 2 years old.   Good luck in your future of learning.",True
@ruthlessadmin,2015-08-14T01:30:10Z,0,"What the nuts are you talking about? Wxpython is not a ""wrapper around"" anything.. it is a Python module.that interfaces with WxWidgets (which happens to be written in C++). Interpreters have nothing to do with it.",True

@MrJdude39,2014-02-27T16:09:00Z,3,"Very well done tutorials. My background is digital forensics. I have been trying to learn Python for various uses in my field. For practice, I created a basic TCP packet sniffer in Python that runs at the command prompt. It creates a socket, pulls in packets, and then formats them. It does the job, but it would look a lot better if I could place the output into a GUI. I would be making various changes as I learn more. Could you tell me how to have the output of my command line program run in a GUI?",True
