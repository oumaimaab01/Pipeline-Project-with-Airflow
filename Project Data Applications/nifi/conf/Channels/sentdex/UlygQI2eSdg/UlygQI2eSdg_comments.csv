@RealMcDudu,2016-06-25T07:58:00Z,1,"A note: when you change the time frame from 1m to 1y to 10y  - you also change the time-frame by which you get values - so for 1-year you will get the close of each day, while for 10-years you will get the close for each week or so. Also, since the trades are only done 5 days a week, a 10-moving-average will correspond to around 2-weeks in the 1-year, and a-30-MA to around 6-weeks (in case you wonder why the dates seem weird)",True
@leninmishra2765,2016-03-24T20:38:49Z,0,"Hi...I have a doubt. I want to draw a coordination diagram for my robotics work. The coordination diagram is a 3d graph with axis of x,y and time in it. Basically I want to plot the waypoints for n robots in the 3d space and check if there is a collision happening at a certain point and time.  Can I do this using python matplotlib ? Please let me know. Your help shall be highly useful.",True
