They have a free plan so wouldn't have to mess with setting up a recurring payment account, but not sure how easy it is to use with opencv.    Any pointers on working with Digital Ocean/Heroku for the first time noob?  3) Can the haar file creation be automated in any way?  i.e. using vlc to save an input camera stream to a series of jpg files (scene filter)..  using a green screen for easy background removal (either in vlc or ImageMagick).. then converting to grayscale  and generating the description file (from within OpenCV).    For example, If it's a face, couldn't detectMultiScale automatically go thru all the pictures,  find the face 'object', resize/crop, save as grayscale, and then save the face coordinates for that image into the description file, without doing anything by hand?",True
@amitsaroussi6304,2016-08-04T05:44:57Z,6,"You can either use Virtual Machine for free instead of buying a server... If you guys searching for program to edit (resize, change color ,etc) many images in one shot you can use the "" david batch processor "" which runs on Gimp (just google it).",True

@isilanes,2016-01-20T21:10:16Z,0,"As another user comments, I would suggest using a Linux virtual machine for that. It's completely free to set up, and completely free to run. You can have your Windows PC run the Haar cascade stuff in the Linux VM running within it for as long as you want, and for free (except electricity cost).",True
