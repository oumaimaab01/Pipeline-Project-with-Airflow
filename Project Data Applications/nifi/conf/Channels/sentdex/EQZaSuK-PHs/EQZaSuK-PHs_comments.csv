Thank You, keep up the awesome videos :)",True
@adarshmcool,2015-02-11T19:51:27Z,0,Thank you so much. You are an inspiration to me.  Your videos are of great practical value and should be compulsory viewing anyone who does machine learning. As a guy studying this stuff seriously (in grad school) you have inspired me to document what I am paying for and pass it along for free the way you have. I wish you all the best.,True

@canivel,2015-02-05T20:43:28Z,2,"Thanks for the videos man, it's awesome. I've watch it all in 2 days ;). Please don't stop doing please! Don't worry about the major of the subscribers are not viewing it right now, It's a brand new territory, for most of them, doing it today, you create a name on that in the future, because no one is doing that today... If you let it now probably someone will do it. This area will be the most important development area for the next years, and you are creating your name on that for sure doing this serie. Please don't stop, please!!!! Or create some paid serie, I pay for it for sure! anyway tks mate very good didactic",True

I guess it's promising, if they can code it, then maybe I can too using python/scikit.
