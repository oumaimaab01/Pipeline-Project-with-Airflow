@yertelt5570,2017-09-19T19:13:56Z,0,"OK, I'm a total noob but here's what I'm taking away from this.  The question should be ""I want to <insert your reason for learning Python here>, which should I learn?""  It would appear if you want to get a job coding in python you should probably go with 2 because of the low industry adoption rate.  I would also think in that case it might be best to start learning 3 eventually, probably sooner rather than later.  If the company decides to make the switch to 3 you might have a leg on your more experienced co-workers if you're already py3 experienced, might even wind up in a project management position overseeing the transition, over more experienced py2 coders.  If you're a hobbyist or learning python to learn the basic concepts of programming before tackling something like C than why not just go with 3?  As for the attitude of Python has to fix 3 and until then I'm not budging, it doesn't make sense, but then as stated I'm a total noob so I may be missing something.  Python, I thought was an open source community developed and supported language, so if you're using it you're part of the community and maybe could spend some of the energy wasted complaining about that library that wasn't converted by actually converting library files.  If it was Visual Basic then absolutely complain about Microsoft dragging their heels or complain about Oracle slowing a JAVA release if you want, they own the languages and are responsible for their upkeep.  If you are actually making money coding in python, if python is helping keep a roof over your head and food on your table than you should be first inline to offer a hand and volunteer some time to the community on whose back you're making your making your living from.  At the very least if you learned py3 and contributed you would probably avoid the scenario above and not wind up working for some kid because he learned py3 and you didn't.  If you can't be bothered to contribute any time then I'm sure they'd gladly take some of that cash you made using Python.",True

@DaddySizeIt,2016-01-19T18:53:10Z,2,"Python2 wins because: more libraries than Py3 (by far, and means less work for the programmer); prod-ready PyPy support (grants pure Python code extremely fast CPU execution / removes an entire class of issues); vastly inferior performance in CPython3 from my own tests on ARM CPUs (close enough on x86 but Py2 still won).  ARM could very well be the server of the future, this is no small/laughing matter that Python3 fails there.  There's no compelling reason for Python3, and the reasons usually given like async io and the rest already exist and have existed in the Py2 ecosystem for ages. It's really ridiculous.  You didn't really give any convincing reasons to use 3. Other than ""that person will become used to Python2 and see no reason to switch"". That's a problem with Python3. Not the kid using Python2. What it is is just indicative of how Python3 is a failure. It's a forced migration (or an attempt to). I really don't think the userbase ever asked for it, so good on them for standing their ground!  If I had to sum up my stance on Python3 it's not one of true opposition it's this: since Python3 is useless, I'll move to it when the zealots do all the heavy lifting + more to have everything ported (and well-tested) on 3. I also require PyPy on a more modern version than 3.2. You guys have  LOT of work ahead of you to get me and others to move over.  It's a serious disservice to teach noobs on 3.x, as they gain nothing other than indoctrination against their own best interests, making their life harder down the road.   They'll have to know Python2 well *anyway* to do any real work (or get a job someday), so avoiding it is absolutely ridiculous. This will be true for at least another decade if not longer. Python3 is the optional language as a result.  My advice to any noobie reading this: tell the Python3 folks to ""get ta portin!!"". They got work to do before convincing you to do something against your own best interests. And the ""latest version"" of a programming language is NOT the same as the latest version of a web browser.   Python3 is technical *churn*, not technical innovation. It's a tool, and akin to replacing a well-built 1950's hammer with a cheap Chinese one from 2008. Exact same thing, hammer is a hammer- one is shinier but to an experienced craftsman, inferior.",True

@cenntraru,2015-12-29T14:12:21Z,0,"Python 3 doesn't make sense. Authors themselves admit that decision was very stupid, but they are too egoistic to take it all back and to return to improving the version 2 line. Py-3 doesn't have any killer-up feature to make people wanting to move, even asyncio is already backported by the trollio module.",True
