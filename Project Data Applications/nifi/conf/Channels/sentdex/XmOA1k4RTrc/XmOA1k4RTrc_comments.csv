@anony88,2017-08-08T09:52:32Z,0,"I've created a few stream scripts. You can set configure a stream to do streak submissions or comments from a custom subreddit. Mine uses user input to ask what subreddit. You can do like news+worldnews+nottheonion, etc. That would be done by literally saying ('python+learnprogramming') for example. You can also filter by keyword. You can set up a notification sound or text to speech and do what I did and make a news announcer(it scans a bunch of news subreddits and speaks for every new submission).  I also set up a comment stream.. So i can stream all comments from a specific subreddit or multiple subreddits and scan for keywords of my choice.  For everything I've mentioned, I scan scan all subreddits and use no filter if I want. I could create a giant database of submissions or comments if I wanted.  I also have an auto responder manager where I can add auto responses to a database. The script streams comments and checks every comment on the pickle database for a response, and responds accordingly. There's another python file I have to easily add or delete responses.  My submission stream script also detects certain keywords in the title and opens a chrome tab automatically to the submission when it's detected. There's a feature on it that plays a certain sound.   Some packages I've used were pickle, gtts for text to speech, pygame for the sound, and pickle for the database. I think it was sys for the web browser",True
