@kartikshrivastava1500,2022-02-22T12:00:52Z,1,"Hi, thanks for the tutorial. I'm a bit confused on where ""kernels"" are used in mean-shift, as I'm following a paper which has mentioned the kernel to use in mean-shift but I can't see it in your tutorial. Are you referring to it by some other name?",True
@jairajsahgal5062,2021-09-30T12:47:27Z,0,Thank you,True

@dibsaha5593,2021-01-19T07:25:53Z,0,Finally I found you very luckily. Please resolve my query. I am newbie in python. So I want to finish only python basic then I want to move ML and want to complete all ML course with Python. Should I move to with Python basic only? I believe I will get satisfaction ans from you only.,True
@alikamel6025,2021-01-12T00:31:16Z,2,"gonna call the main class mean_shift ... bet you didn't see that coming, classic sentdex, you rock man",True
@anjanayadav8731,2020-06-30T17:56:25Z,0,"I am following your channel and find pretty straight, clean and great content here. Wanted to quote Einstein : ' If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough'. and you definitely have a way of explaining it in the simplest way possible. Had a request if you could also record something on the feature compression techniques, Hopefully PCA and LDA similarly. Thanks again. Keep going",True
@abdessamadel1906,2020-02-28T15:00:47Z,0,I get an error at this line : new_centroids.append(tuple(new_centroid)). the error says : 'numpy.float64' object is not iterable . any help please,True

@nikhithasrinivas,2019-02-04T22:29:20Z,0,"Hey!  I am trying to classify the text into categories/ clusters. Can you please help me understand how to start with 'Mean Shift'?  Also, for my text data in excel, do I need to point each data to a point in a feature space manually?  Can you please provide me your email id for questions?I would really appreciate  if you can provide me!",True
@aashishmehtoliya5800,2019-02-03T17:42:43Z,0,i am getting same result without using dict in this line --> (prev_centroids = dict(centroids)). Then why are we using dict. Plz explain.,True
@ankanghosh1023,2018-12-17T16:23:42Z,1,"Thanks for the tutorial. If you are of the opinion that sorting the list makes for a good comparison, then the initial list should be sorted, isn't it?",True
@chardlau5617,2018-07-05T07:49:55Z,0,I find the code:  for featureset in data:     if np.linalg.nor(featureset-centroid) < self.radius:         in_bandwidth.append(featureset)  should be replace with below:  for j in centroids:     if np.linalg.nor(centroids[j]-centroid) < self.radius:         in_bandwidth.append(centroids[j])  which take virtual centroid points into calculation in every loop.,True

@saurabhkhodake,2017-04-03T17:43:11Z,0,"Hi Harrison, am not able to understand the real purpose of learning algorithm from scratch. I enjoy it no doubt, but am i wasting time?  Sorry if the tone is coming offensive, not intended at all.  One quick question: Will it be ok, if I just go through the scratch logic algorithm for understanding purposes. And use scikit packages for work? Am i losing anything here? Or am i being a lazy bum....haha  P.S. : You are Messiah",True

The rest of the code was the same, just the data set was modified. Why is it behaving like this? There is no 'max_iter' parameter in the code.",True
