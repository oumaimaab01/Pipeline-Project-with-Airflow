@Madremiaquecomplicao,2015-07-16T15:33:14Z,0,"Please clarify if I am mistaken or missing something:  I have been using this hh and ll in calculating Williams%R index and in my programme it didn't work properly. As you use the range c[x-tf:x], the end of the range would be x-1, and not x! So I believe the range to calculate the highs and lows should be c[x-tf:x+1] right??",True
