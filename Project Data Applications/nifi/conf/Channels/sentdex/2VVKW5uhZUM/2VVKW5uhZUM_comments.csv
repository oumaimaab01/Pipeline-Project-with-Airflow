@ortzg,2013-12-01T15:42:25Z,0,My matplotlib somehow won't plot on me when the whole process isn't finished even with the raw_input() stopper (the plot windows did show up but without any graphic until the whole program is finished).. I copied the code for plotting as shown in the current and previous videos without making any changes.. plotting also seems to be non-blocking.. i.e. the program seems to go on without stopping when something is being plotted unlike what is demonstrated in this set of tutorial videos.. where there's a visible pause when something is being plotted..  Does it perhaps have to do with my matplotlib setup or IDE even? What matplotlib backend are you using? Mine is Qt4Agg,True
