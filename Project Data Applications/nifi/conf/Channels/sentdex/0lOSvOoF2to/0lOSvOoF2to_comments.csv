@YouBetterBeYou,2023-09-06T20:03:24Z,0,"If I am getting this right, function calls allow us to instruct GPT to iterate on its own response without making multiple API calls, correct? So, some simple applications would be ""format_response_html"" where you can make GPT provide a html/markdown version of its response, correct? That means you can probably also make more elaborate iterations on the content like ""formulate_1_leading_question"" that takes the response and turns it into a leading question that nudges the user towards the desired outcome instead of directly telling the user, correct?  So whereas with prompt engineering, fine-tuning and embeddings you give up-front instructions for the text generation--which fails to deliver the desired results consistently, we can now put it into a function as way of post-processing the response.

I'm no programmer, I've actually decided to work with chat gpt to help me create some apps that I wished existed and kinda leaning along the way. Bit I've been in IT for years so I get how things should operate but coding syntaxes is something else entirely. My idea while using chatgpt with its access to web search and noteables via plugins, was to create a series of routines and shorthand. So instead of spending all my time working and reworking my prompts I could create a series of routines and subroutines that would tell it exactly how I wanted it to behave. I use various tagging techniques and had it form an index to refer to. So for a bit I could say something in a prompt like: <execute>[rt:1] and based on the documents in Noteables it would go find that routine and then follow it. The problem is these tags mean less and less as the conversation goes on because from my understanding the weight of the initial context means less and less. Still fun tho",True

@nathanburley,2023-06-20T14:23:52Z,0,"So I think you hit the nail on the head when you said this sucks up context allowance. Also, why add complexity to the prompt to add more functions if you're also having to add more complexity on the handling side which executes functions as well.  I'm a bit puzzled by whether this will perform better than my existing treatment. Before this released I was just asking GPT to convert the user message into a standardised JSON output. If the JSON is standard for all command types then you don't need dozens of functions in the prompt, just one. When handling the GPT output though you can have code which hooks into that JSON and executes various functions e.g. JSON might package for Command / Target / Message where Command is the function being run (like email), the target is like the person or place being targetted, and the message is the data to send / retrieve. Each field is used for a different thing on different functions.

@memespdf,2023-06-15T05:40:43Z,1,The functions data passed to GPT looks like a JSON-ified version of OpenAPI 3.0 spec. Is there any information about if this is intended? Maybe OpenAI used public OpenAPI specs for training?,True
@technolus5742,2023-06-15T05:23:16Z,1,I suppose there is a hacky way to still get the content. Just define the function call to contain a content parameter of type string and instruct gpt to populate it with the content you desire.,True
@andrewxzvxcud2,2023-06-15T05:22:12Z,1,8:34 lol,True
@dustinmorrison6315,2023-06-15T05:17:23Z,1,Can't wait for bender the robot.,True
@StephenRoseDuo,2023-06-15T05:16:27Z,1,This is indeed absolutely insane,True
@ajnart_,2023-06-15T04:50:36Z,0,6:12 warranted a like from me. It's nice to see how enthusiastic you are about this,True
@dirty_haute,2023-06-15T04:48:41Z,1,"Slick. Much better than the, ""Give me the results in the following json format {'foo':'bar'}"" that was required before. Im excited to try a set up 2 functions for input to gpt as well as output.",True
@maheshagodekere,2023-06-15T04:22:51Z,1,"Everybody is considering rewriting their apps after OpenAI ""function calling"" release. We all will keep rewriting our apps frequently!",True
@azmo_,2023-06-15T04:03:24Z,0,"Can I define functions whose parameter is an enum which I've defined before, so ChatGPT has to choose from one of the given options?",True
@SenselessTalk,2023-06-15T02:57:58Z,1,Can we already do this function thingy using Tools in Langchain?,True
@PhunkNPharaoh,2023-06-15T02:16:51Z,24,Been hoping to see a video on this new feature. Everyone is talking about the larger 16k context but not much mention about these intelligent functions. This is a game changer. Great explanation & great job!!,True
@BlueyMcPhluey,2023-06-15T02:03:50Z,9,"Thanks for covering this. It's funny, I feel like simultaneously this opens up so many doors, but also I have no idea what those doors could even be. I find it really hard to think of applications for this kind of thing",True
@princemars6746,2023-06-15T01:41:48Z,164,"His authentic happiness shows just how much of a bombshell function calling will be, and for them to nonchalantly release it is interesting.",True
@Jamman88888,2023-06-15T01:36:11Z,3,"6:10 ""do cool shhhh...stuff."" nice save haha.  Good video, i wonder if a lack of functions like this is why the snapchat AI used to gaslight people? It would tell them it didn‚Äôt know their location for privacy reasons, then in the same sentence tell them where the closest macdonalds was, or the weather in their area.  Also, any chance on a new gantheftauto video? Its been 2 years, and its my all time favourite of yours :p",True
@countofst.germain6417,2023-06-15T01:24:03Z,1,Good work you were quick with this one.,True
@x1expert1x,2023-06-15T01:17:33Z,4,make a function that writes new functions based on the AI's desires. Boom. fully unlocked AI,True
@whattimeisitnow124,2023-06-15T01:16:08Z,0,What's with the crazy long ads in between??? A guy talking about socks for 5 minutes straight,True
@devdeque7846,2023-06-15T00:57:36Z,4,the function doesn't seem to be a function at all. you're simply providing more context so it can provide a more accurate result for what you're expecting.,True
@trentleslie2888,2023-06-15T00:57:26Z,13,"So stoked you covered this. Getting creative output in a structured format is huge due to its contradictory goals. I assume you can still change temperature? I didn't see anything about that, guess I'll just have to try.",True
@FinnBrownc,2023-06-15T00:54:27Z,0,that vscode update badge is driving me crazy,True
@jainicz,2023-06-15T00:49:23Z,2,"Thanks for your video! I wonder how is this different from, say, a weather plugin? Doesn't a plugin do the same thing by calling some ""functions"" that were written by human developers?",True
@mytechnotalent,2023-06-15T00:26:18Z,10,Harrison this is crazy.  I really wish you would create a GPT from scratch series.  I know you had a 2 years ago GPT series but what do you think?  I am also helping new students with your book.  They are buying the ebook.,True
@OfficialPeterArizBurner,2023-06-15T00:18:39Z,1,woahhhh,True
@Xonem1,2023-06-15T00:17:19Z,0,Second üòÇ,True
