@digital_down,2019-04-15T01:44:35Z,0,It takes me (on average) two hours to render a frame when making 3D animations. These deep dream frames render in under a minute even with CPU  rendering. I definitely canâ€™t complain about render times. This is pretty sick imo.,True
@Pitrium,2018-09-19T21:46:14Z,4,"First of all thank you so much for all of your tutorials!  Regarding the small improvements you asked about:  1) You can automatically get the resolution of the image using: img_result = load_image(filename=""{}{}/img_{}.jpg"".format(dreamDirectory, dreamName, i)) xSize = len(img_result[0]) ySize = len(img_result)  2) You can automatically adapt the brightness to let it run unsupervised for longer periods of time using (not really nice but working): # Adjust the brightness of the image by ensuring that the red green and blue portions of the  # image are above/below the defined thresholds. upperBrightnessLevel = xSize*ySize*255*0.8 lowerBrightnessLevel = xSize*ySize*255*0.2 redSum = numpy.sum(img_result[:, :, 0]) if redSum < lowerBrightnessLevel:  redCorrection = int(random.choice(""34"")) elif redSum > upperBrightnessLevel:  redCorrection = int(random.choice(""12"")) img_result[:, :, 0] += redCorrection greenSum = numpy.sum(img_result[:, :, 0]) if greenSum < lowerBrightnessLevel:  greenCorrection = int(random.choice(""34"")) elif greenSum > upperBrightnessLevel:  greenCorrection = int(random.choice(""12"")) img_result[:, :, 1] += greenCorrection blueSum = numpy.sum(img_result[:, :, 0]) if blueSum < lowerBrightnessLevel:  blueCorrection = int(random.choice(""34"")) elif blueSum > upperBrightnessLevel:  blueCorrection = int(random.choice(""12"")) img_result[:, :, 2] += blueCorrection img_result = np.clip(img_result, 0.0, 255.0) img_result = img_result.astype(np.uint8)  In case you're interested, I've created kind of an application layer on top of your code to make the use of it even easier at: https://trustmeimanengineer.de/en/deep-dream/  Thank you very much again and have a nice day!",True

@dkvkumar867,2018-04-14T03:30:21Z,0,"Sir, I want a video on that how u will extract data from pdf files and how u will do automation. for example if we want that there is a form  which contains fields like First name, last name, email, phone no and so on...Now we have a Resume in Pdf format and we want that if we insert that PDF to that program then it automatically fetch data and fill the form as first name as first name and fill all the fields related to it....please help me out of it and solve my query. i also post this comment in your last video but i forgot that on which video i posted so please help me to out of it with the help of python.",True

@athilalthaf6222,2018-04-13T18:26:20Z,0,"Can you do a series on ant colony optimisation , particle swarm algorithm on pygame",True
@SSJ3Tim,2018-04-13T16:00:14Z,2,"Since you asked about why the zooming isn't centered, you were correct about which line it was. Instead of this:  img_result[x_trim:y_size-ytrim, y_trim:x_size-x_trim]  Which trims more off the left side than the right, and more off the bottom than the top, it should be this:  img_result[y_trim:y_size-ytrim, x_trim:x_size-x_trim]  Great video as always!",True
