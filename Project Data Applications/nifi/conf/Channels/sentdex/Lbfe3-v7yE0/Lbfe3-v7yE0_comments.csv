@chesster5981,2022-11-24T22:08:55Z,0,"1:18  AF_INET is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 addresses). When you create a socket, you have to specify its address family, and then you can only use addresses of that type with the socket. The Linux kernel, for example, supports 29 other address families such as UNIX (AF_UNIX) sockets and IPX (AF_IPX), and also communications with IRDA and Bluetooth (AF_IRDA and AF_BLUETOOTH, but it is doubtful you'll use these at such a low level).  For the most part, sticking with AF_INET for socket programming over a network is the safest option. There is also AF_INET6 for Internet Protocol v6 addresses.

In fact, they’re so closely related that they actually have the same value, and many programmers will call socket() and pass AF_INET as the first argument instead of PF_INET. Now, get some milk and cookies, because it’s time for a story. Once upon a time, a long time ago, it was thought that maybe an address family (what the “AF” in “AF_INET” stands for) might support several protocols that were referred to by their protocol family (what the “PF” in “PF_INET” stands for). That didn’t happen. And they all lived happily ever after, The End. So the most correct thing to do is to use AF_INET in your struct sockaddr_in and PF_INET in your call to socket().)""

This prevents non-priv users and processes from listening on well-known ports like ftp (21), smtp (25), etc - doing all kinds of nefarious things like collecting credentials, intercepting emails, etc.  You’re not going to clobber any existing services by trying to bind to a port already in use.

In order to communicate with a specific client you need its address and port number (which is exactly what clientsocket variable is for) usually the server opens a thread for serving each client.,True

@timandmel777,2020-04-16T14:20:26Z,0,"Hi sentdex.  Good tutorial, it get's to the point quickly without painfully explaining the history and the why and on and on.  Just enough background and just get to it! I like it.  Just one note.  I know this works for a tutorial purpose, but when you concatenate a string with += in a loop, it's dangerous.  If this were a very large amount of text, the stack memory could exhaust. This is because strings are immutable and so each loop, it creates another copy of the string plus the added part each loop.  In a fast loop with many iterations, the python garbage collection will not have enough time to release the memory for the previous copies and run out of stack memory.  It is good Python practice to not use that method in a loop.  Rather, append to a list of strings in the loop, then join them together at the end. Just a word of caution for those who may want to scale something like this up.",True

@deanlhouston,2019-07-06T03:22:33Z,0,"Your confusion at the 4:00 mark about clientsocket being the ""foreign socket"" is weird.  Think of a socket as a pipe with two ends, one local on your machine and the other on the ""foreign"" machine.  Data has to flow into the local end on your machine to get to the end on the foreign machine.  So, there is no ""foreign socket"", there's  just one socket with ""foreign"" and local ends. You're confusing your viewers by implying there's more than one socket.  So ok, you might ask ""Well what about socket s then?""  Yes, socket s is still there, but it is the listen socket, and accept() creates a new, totally separate socket (that you happened to call clientsocket) for data transfer so that s can continue to listen for more connections.  All your sends and receives occur on clientsocket.  You could have simply called that socket ""sendreceivesocket"" to make it clearer what it's for.",True
