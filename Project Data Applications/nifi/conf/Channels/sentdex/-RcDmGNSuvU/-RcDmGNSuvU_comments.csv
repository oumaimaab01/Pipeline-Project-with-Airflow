@nizanu112,2016-12-09T18:24:41Z,19,"just for general knowledge, on about 4:20, you said that if you can get big log files and have storage space problems since the log files are so big, a good way to handle this is importing ""from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler"" it handles that problem by configuring a max file size, and number of files, when the log file reaches that size it will close it and create a new file, when the number of files reaches the number of files you configured, it will delete the oldest one. a great little handler that will help alot",True
@CakeBossan,2016-12-09T03:53:01Z,0,"thank you for this series by the way, i've been too used to the functional paradigm while using python, and while i've started using classes, it's v. v. nice to see these intermediate techniques.  question: when would you use multiple .py files and start using imports? i see a lot of java programs implement a ton of classes, and i'm wondering why most python programs don't do the same thing.",True
@idle_user,2016-12-09T00:37:42Z,2,"Before knowing about logging I created my own small logging module that logs the time, module name, and the message I wish to log -  formatted nicely. It'll generate a new log file every 24 hours.   Not really practical, but it sure helped me out a lot, especially because I was too lazy to read the documentation for standard logging.   Thanks for the video!",True

@steinarrhrafnhoskuldsson2936,2016-12-08T15:45:07Z,7,"Fun fact -  The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system.
