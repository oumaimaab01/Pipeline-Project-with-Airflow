@AlienService,2017-07-10T05:58:46Z,0,"Thanks for these videos! You're a great resource.  One question I had that you'd be a perfect person to ask is, suppose you used Keras to write code that scans financial twitter account and does sentiment analysis.  If it detects something like ""Umbrella Corp. is concerned with reports coming from Racoon City.""  It sends a negative ""GTFO"" signal for U(mbrella).  How would I go coding my Quantopian Robinhood live trading alg to receive that signal and sell, sell, sell Umbrella.    As I understand it,  Quantopian doesn't support Tensorflow and Keras and has limits to what you can and can't call in a live training algorithm.  If I had pre-trained a model that worked well in Keras, and say I saved the weights to json, how could I go about using those weights within Quantopian.  Or alternatively, how would you go about say having a variable that graded results and adjusted weights on a strategy.  So if strategy A says buy and value goes up add a reward and do more of that, and if strategy B says sell and is wrong its weight is dropped and do less of that.  Thanks again for the great work.",True

@xro7117,2017-06-30T10:04:12Z,0,Yo sentdex nice job!. Ever consider the possibility of feeding your convolution outputs for every timestep to an lstm?  By doing this you introduce the concept of memory in your network. As a result current actions will be affected by the previous ones.,True

@RaccoonDealer,2017-06-21T19:26:18Z,2,You should include more reversing in your training data because that seems to be the main point where it gets stuck.,True
@MrKnarleyMarley,2017-06-21T17:44:07Z,0,"I don't see it so much as a watering down of the problem or somehow cheapening it. I think it's just efficient to solve the problem in smaller simple chunks. Train for city say, then when you feel good about that, train for off road. It's just so much more efficient, particularly when working with such huge data, no?",True
@Kitokid12,2017-06-21T14:48:43Z,1,i am not sure if this is even possible but couldn't you combine 2 separate neural networks? One trained on following the road(or waypoints) and one on avoiding obstacles and then you sort of combine them and reward them if they achieve their individual goal (by that i mean a counter that it tries to raise (maybe a linear increase if the car is on track and doesn't hit any obstacles for a specific amount of time and then an exponential decrease if one (or even both) things are not achieved). This would allow the individual networks to focus on the for them relevant information (e.g. the network for the road could look at the minimap while the other one would totally ignore it). I think this would (if it is even possible) save you a lot of training and maybe even prevent situations where the network can't decide between one of the two (cuz now it would try to achieve both),True

@Ganxxta,2017-06-20T21:46:07Z,0,"I'm just wondering why you even need no_keys?He can brake when he wants to go slower and turn without acceleration is also possible.Wouldn't removing that option also reduce complexity and training time? And avoid avoid situations when he's unsure what to do and just does nothing just to get teleported? Wouldn't it be better in 'unsure' moments just to use the most likely option, in the next frame he would maybe decide better, but when he's not moving its always more or less the same frame, so his decision is also no changing and a teleport is necessary. I believe avoiding teleports as much as possible would be very helpful, especially when you introduce reinforced learning.  Anyway, keep it up and keep posting your progress on YT and twitch  :D",True

Would be cool to see the # of times stuck per min. etc. 4) Perhaps you can either mod the map size or instead use OpenCV or something to extract the map, scale it up, and then superimpose it back onto the image that the neuralnet sees. 5) As a way to ""simulate"" having a specialized vehicle location detection algorithm, perhaps you could skin the cars as certain colors/patterns that the AI will easily distinguish? 6) Create different versions of the model for day and night?",True
