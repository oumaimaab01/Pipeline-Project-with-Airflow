@Hellomynamesolly,2018-05-12T13:29:54Z,0,"After successfully adding Bittrex, I am facing a problem when I try to add Binance as my second option.   The x axis of the Binance graph displays the prices but they are not in order. The only thing I'm doing differently to your video is plotting allDates instead of buyDates and sellDates separately as Binance do not specify if it was a buy or sell.  a.plot_date(allDates, data[""price""], lightColor, label=""Last"")   instead of  a.plot_date(buyDates, buys[""Price""], lightColor, label=""buys"")  a.plot_date(sellDates, sells[""Price""], darkColor, label=""sells"")  I have been trying to work this one out for a while now.  Any help much appreciated.   There are the API links: https://bittrex.com/api/v1.1/public/getmarkethistory?market=USDT-BTC https://www.binance.com/api/v1/trades?symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=100",True

@datmesay,2016-03-19T18:08:17Z,3,"Hey @sentdex, thx for this gr8 content.  I guess bitstamp has added buys & sell now since we can now see type 0(buy)/1(sell) flag in the pulled out data.  cheers.",True
@jonasandersson6514,2015-01-17T22:17:49Z,0,"Great stuff! I'm learning a lot about programming! I have many more vids to go through, but when looking at tick data it gets a lot clearer if you use 'step' as draw style. Just a nicer way of displaying it and it's easier to visually see spreads and all too...",True
