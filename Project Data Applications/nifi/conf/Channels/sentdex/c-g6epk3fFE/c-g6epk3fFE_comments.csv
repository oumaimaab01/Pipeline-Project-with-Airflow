@brandonbahret5632,2023-03-14T20:54:56Z,0,"From my experience, ChatGPT is not good at generating large segments of text. When prompted to, it will often be cut short in its generation. So, it would seem like generating entire software projects is impossible at first; however, it *is* good at generating small segments of code.  Proposal for circumnavigating these limitations:  1. Use ChatGPT to generate documentation: Once the intent of the project is defined, use ChatGPT to generate documentation for the project. This can include high-level overviews, detailed descriptions of classes and methods, and examples of how the project can be used.  2. Refine the project structure based on the generated documentation: Use the documentation generated by ChatGPT to refine the project structure and ensure that it accurately reflects the project's goals and requirements.  3. Implement project functionality: Use the project structure and generated documentation to begin implementing the project's functionality. This includes writing code for individual classes and methods, and integrating them into the larger project structure.  4. Continuously refine and iterate: As the project is being developed, continue to refine and iterate on the project structure and functionality. Use ChatGPT as needed to generate documentation and assist in the development process.  Using this approach, the ChatGPT should be able to generate an architecture for a larger software project, but is defined in such a way that ChatGPT can implement one component at a time. The generated documentation could first be read to judge the coherence of the architecture, then if it's reasonable, have ChatGPT generate the files, classes, functions and so on (ideally) following atomic design.  Testing could even be automated. Say, use the ChatGPT api to generate the files locally, then run them in a virtual machine (for obvious reasons) and chain the output back into ChatGPT so it can modify the code until it appears to work correctly.",True

@T13Nemo,2023-03-10T19:51:51Z,1,Is it possible to actually give internet access to the gpt levrraging google api for example? So that bot can search on the internet and get knowledge of the most recent events?,True
@funkahontas,2023-03-10T19:31:06Z,24,"In my experience, the system role is really useful for things like restraining the bot as to what it can do , and also to give it some background information like how it would like to be called or what tasks it can perform. So when the user asks :"" what can you do for me ?"" The chatbot can answer what the system says it will be able to do or what it's main purpose is , and the personality you want the bot to have. The system message may be something like ""You are a language translation helping bot, you cannot talk about anything else, your name is Bob and you are a stern but calm teacher.""",True
