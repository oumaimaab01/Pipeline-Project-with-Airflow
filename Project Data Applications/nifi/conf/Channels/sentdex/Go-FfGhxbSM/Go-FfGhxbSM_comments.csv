@roadmonitoroz,2023-06-14T05:33:12Z,0,"It's a shame that python doesn't have a f unction like DIM  in old style basic. i.e. In basic you could go .... dim a$(100,10) print a$(47,1)  Basically DIM would initialize 100 rows x 10 columns of data that could be say 256 characters long [just a guess at the limit]. In other words 100 x 10 x 256 bytes allocated. This made setting up, addressing, storing so much easier in many ways Of course if you went over your array settings , you'd spit an error and crash most likely.   With formatting, I've sometimes written something in basic, captured the output then copy / pasted it across.  I was writing something that had 5 co-ordinates for each set of data and about 1200 sets of data. For this, it was much easy to go to basic and go.... a1 = read a$ a2 = read a$ a3 = read a$ a4 = read a$ a5 = read a$ print ""[""+ ""["" +a1 +   etc etc  data 3,4,5,3,2,6,6,6,6,4,3,2,2,0,5 etc etc  Thanks.

@EminoMeneko,2019-07-23T11:53:19Z,0,"I'm not so new to programming and not so new to multi dimentional lists neither. But python behaves very strangely to my code.   This is a sample: >>> tb = [[""""]*2]*3 >>> print(tb) [['', ''], ['', ''], ['', '']] >>> tb[0][0] = 0 >>> print(tb) [[0, ''], [0, ''], [0, '']] >>> tb[0][1] = 1 >>> print(tb) [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]] >>> tb[1][0] = 2 >>> print(tb) [[2, 1], [2, 1], [2, 1]] >>> tb[1][1] = 3 >>> print(tb) [[2, 3], [2, 3], [2, 3]]  It is crushing everything like it considers only the last index should be taken in account. Why is that ? I must say that the above code is for trial because I obviously tried my code with loops first.  The same kind of code works perfectly in Java.  package essais;  public class MultiDimTables {    public static void main(String...args){       String[][] tb = new String[10][2];       System.out.println(""Populating..."");       for (int i=0;i<10;i++){          for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {             tb[i][j] = ""[i: ""+i+"", j: ""+j+""]"";          }       }        System.out.println(""Printing..."");       for (int i=0;i<10;i++){          for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {             System.out.println(tb[i][j]);          }       }    } }  OUTPUT: Populating... Printing... [i: 0, j: 0] [i: 0, j: 1] [i: 1, j: 0] [i: 1, j: 1] [i: 2, j: 0] [i: 2, j: 1] [i: 3, j: 0] [i: 3, j: 1] [i: 4, j: 0] [i: 4, j: 1] [i: 5, j: 0] [i: 5, j: 1] [i: 6, j: 0] [i: 6, j: 1] [i: 7, j: 0] [i: 7, j: 1] [i: 8, j: 0] [i: 8, j: 1] [i: 9, j: 0] [i: 9, j: 1]  Process finished with exit code 0  Can someone explain to me what's wrong with my Python code or reasoning?  P.S. : Did some research. Got it. The way it works in Python sucks. Initialising the way I did is actually referencing 3 times the same list of 2 elements. Hence if you change any element of the same list, the ""others"" (which are actually the same) updates together. This sucks but once you know you'll be careful. How to proceed is like this: [[""""] * 2 for i in range(3)] Replace 2 and 3 by any number or variable if needs be.",True
