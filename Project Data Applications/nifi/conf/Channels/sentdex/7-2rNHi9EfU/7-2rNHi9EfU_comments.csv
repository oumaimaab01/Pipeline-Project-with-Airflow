@Majskolvenz,2017-01-02T00:53:46Z,0,"Importing sys seems unnecessary, the same tuple returned by sys.exc_info() can be created like this: (e.__class__, e, e.__traceback__).",True
@koolaidman31893,2016-12-14T01:41:02Z,1,You really should talk about how catching a general Exception like 'Exception' is generally a really bad idea.  You want to catch the narrowest exception as you can to be able to handle it appropriately and have as little code as you can inside the try block again to be able to handle the exception and trace it easier.  Also another cool thing just to talk about would be using else: in addition to the try: except: block.,True
