@NoToBusinessCasual,2020-12-11T04:39:26Z,0,"Has anyone had the problem that when you select one of the Middle Indicators, the main plot goes away. When you select ""Tick"", the main graph comes back (without the middle indicators). And when you move back to ""1 Day"", the main graph vanishes and only the selected middle indicators show. Its like a toggle between the two as you select Tick or 1Day from ""Data Time Frame"".",True

@user-if1ql1do5k,2020-06-21T00:03:16Z,0,"All those seaofbtc.com  related URL no longer exist ! So I have failed to follow this Tutorial and complete the project. Even though I strive to make many modification myself about API related code,  I have failed to follow at part23.  Noted: I try to use some other API such CryptoCompare, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi Golbal. I can get some OHLCV data from these API connection. But their response data-format is quite different from your code demonstration.",True
@iceman280782,2020-05-10T19:44:41Z,0,Hi sentdex. First of all I appreciate your work. I was wondering if I could overlay another plot on the main stock data plot with subplot2grid. So let's say I want to see the stock OHLC and also on the left top corner the current MACD value and RSI value as text. Is this possible? Like on the tradingview page https://de.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=FX%3AEURUSD,True
@GodSavetheWest,2018-08-19T12:12:14Z,2,"I knew from the beginning that you were the creator of SeaofBTC. It is such a shame itÂ´s down now. What happened to it? did you have to close it or did you do it by your own iniciative. I wish I could have seen it in action, however, I got to keep moving and I was wondering... Is there any chance you could reopen it or smth like that? and if not, what do you use or what could I use to get that data. Right now the application built in these tutorials is not working for me, but I am optimistic, I plan to use your code (once I reach the end of the tutorials) as a template to build other apps in order to trade with something else, maybe the S&P 500 for example. I must say I am quite a beginner to programming in general but I'm trying to make my way.",True

@marcovanderheijden8216,2018-01-09T21:04:58Z,2,"Hi!   First of all, until now I have really enjoyed this tutorial. I never realized this project was going to be so big, so respect for all the preparation you have done!  Second: I guess most people are getting stuck up to this moment as it is not possible (anymore) to pull data from seaofbtc. Do you recommend any other site of which we can pull data in more or less the same format?",True
@thetruth45678,2017-12-31T22:19:25Z,1,"Your code doesn't work anymore. Something about pandas, I think, has changed. I had to use mpl_finance as matplotlib.finance is deprecated. I also used .ohlc() instead of 'how=""ohlc""', and just added .sum to the resample of volume. Your code gives warnings about that, if you run it now as it is on your site. Not sure if those changes will work or not. Then there's the non-tick animate error that breaks the program:  failed in the non-tick animate: 'MultiIndex' object has no attribute 'to_pydatetime'",True
@thetruth45678,2017-12-30T08:50:34Z,0,How nice it went so well for you.  failed in the non-tick animate: Expecting value: line 1 column 2 (char 1)  Now I have to go back and re-watch your last 3 or 4 videos. There goes an hour or two. Would have been nice if you included links to the code.,True
