@17Codiferus,2019-09-15T01:12:05Z,2,"So I noticed something slightly counter intuitive when playing around with this code.  I have a desktop with a 1080ti and a laptop with a 1060. Running a training session on both with the same settings the 1060 trained a 100 episode model ~3 minutes _faster_ than the 1080ti. At first I was confused/disappointed until I realized the 1060 was only getting about 2FPS while the 1080ti gets 22FPS, so if I understand correctly the 1080ti is training on roughly 11x as much data, and only taking _slightly_ longer to do it, which makes a lot more sense than my 1060 outperforming my 1080ti.   So to others running this code, faster training times aren't necessarily good. The more frames you can generate per episode, the more data your models have to train on which _should_ lead to better results.",True
