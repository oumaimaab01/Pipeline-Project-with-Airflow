@Throwingness,2017-04-22T20:03:04Z,0,About the memory you speak of at 12:00 Doesn't Tensorflow have ways of dealing with this? From StackOverflow... # Assume that you have 12GB of GPU memory and want to allocate ~4GB: gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.333) sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options))  and  config = tf.ConfigProto() config.gpu_options.allow_growth=True sess = tf.Session(config=config)  I haven't tried these yet because I just found them and I can't find a script that I can replace all the tf.Seesion()'s easily. I happen to have an iMac with a Nvidia 780m and I'd like to be able to use it without crashing and getting this error.,True

@danweecc,2016-12-17T10:07:17Z,0,"I have a question - what if I want to train the network based on two sets of data. For example, I want the network to predict the humidity based on past humidity trends AND past temperature trends. In this case, how should I organize the input layer? I would think that for just one time-series, I would use a regular sliding window on the series. With two series, do I just present both windows (from the humidity and temperature series) to the input layer that is twice the size of the window? if not, how else can I configure the input layer so that it doesn't confuse between the two sets of training data?",True
