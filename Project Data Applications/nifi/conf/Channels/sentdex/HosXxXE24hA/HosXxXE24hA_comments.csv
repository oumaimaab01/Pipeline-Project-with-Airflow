Is some of the matplotlib 16 bit?  Is there a way to get a 64 bit executable?",True
@gerdmarbjerg8330,2016-02-18T13:22:36Z,2,"Hello,  When I try to convert any Python code including a matplotlib figure, it does not work. I get a warning about missing modules and among the missing modules are some related to matplotlib:  ""Missing modules: ? wx imported from matplotlib.backends.wx, matplotlib.backends.wxagg, matplotlib.backends.wx_compat, matplotlib.pyplot This is not necessarily a problem - the modules may not be needed on this platform.""  It finishes creating the .exe file, but the .exe file does not work. It chrashes right away and does not give an error, even if I run it through cmd.exe.   My setup file (as you can see I have tried to specify the modules I want to include):  import cx_Freeze import sys  import sys if sys.platform=='win32':     base = 'Win32GUI' else:     base = None  executables = [cx_Freeze.Executable('TestApp.py', base = base)] cx_Freeze.setup(     name = 'TestApp',     options = {'build_exe': {'include_files': ['Test.txt'],                              'packages': ['tkinter','tkinter.filedialog',                                           'matplotlib','numpy','matplotlib.pyplot',                                           'matplotlib.backends','matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg',                                           'matplotlib.figure']}},     version = '0.01',     description = 'Test application',     executables = executables     )  Do you have any idea how I get it to include the missing modules? I can make an executable application from Tkinter without any matplotlib.  Thank you!",True

@ryankeenan,2015-10-05T05:39:01Z,0,"Hey, I really enjoyed this Tkinter series and I built my own little app using yours as a template.  I don't really need live animation, so I converted your ""animate"" function into just a ""doSomePlotting"" function.  I've got buttons and pulldown menus that change the plots on the various pages, which all worked great using animation,  but now without the animate function in action I can't get the plots to refresh!  How can I just get, say, the PageThree frame to redraw its canvas and update the plots without re-__init__ializing the whole app?  Thanks!  and looking forward to diving into your other series :).",True

@copernicus13,2015-05-26T20:51:33Z,0,"There will be an import statement for sure. Whole data fetch process in the app is based on sql queries and presenting obtained data via label lists and graphs. It's somewhat prototype for later server-based one.  Initially, I wanted to create .db beforehand and attach it to compiled via cx_freeze program. My idea was that env. without sqlite in registry and env. path can't run program that is creating db class file at some point.  But now I'm wondering whether that kind of env. can handle app based on queries, even if db is already attached. That's why sqlite3; standard lib in Py.   So next question please - can sqlite3 module in Py handle that kind of action?",True
