@typhlosionisbest,2023-06-17T23:23:35Z,2,"I really appreciate the approach that you take in teaching this. It's easier to actively learn by applying to a project this way, rather than just running down the list of fundamentals while providing no connection between anything or examples of their practical uses. I also appreciate the smaller things at the end like the google search, editing the url, and the Find in Page tool. Things like that show me that I'm learning from someone who actually knows how to use a computer. It's small, but it tells me that you don't expect me to be an idiot, and that you're the type of teacher that's qualified in more than just title or awards. Instead of regurgitating what a textbook says, you actually know what you're doing.   I'm currently attending a technical school for Computer Programming, and I wish that the relief of seeing a qualified teacher was not a feeling that I could experience; it should be the standard. I have been dreading learning Python for silly reasons, but your methods make me feel welcome and engaged as I tackle a project in computer vision with very little knowledge about the field. Thank you so much for teaching.",True

@WilliamPayneNZ,2021-12-21T06:00:03Z,7,"Just found your channel. Looks like I will really enjoy it.   I am constantly on the lookout for good tutorials as a beginner to programming. One thing I have found interesting on many programming tutorials is that the person doing the teaching may use words that an absolute beginner may not know. For example if someone has never programmed before at all they may not know what a string is, or a variable or really anything at all about things that are absolutely basic to someone who has done it a while.   I work in mechanical engineering and I often have to keep myself grounded and humble when I meet someone who is completely new to the field. For example I cant expect someone to know how to undo a screw without knowing what a screw and the different types of screwdrivers there are. That is an extreme scenario but something I see a lot is that people forget what it is like to know nothing and be completely new to a subject.    Love your stuff so far will happily keep watching.",True

I have setup a Treeview widget with 3 columns, although there is a blank one on the far left for some reason too, and I want to use a for loop (like copied below from my app) to fetch each pwd record and iterate through the 'pwd' record and grab the company, passwd, and pwd_create_dt data and insert each into a column wihtin the first row of the Treeview (tv).      i = 0     count = 0       #-- NUMBER OF PASSWORD RECORDS COUNTER       for pwd in all_pwd:         #print(str(pwd))         tv.insert(' ', i, 'company', pwd[i][3])         tv.insert(' ', i, 'passwd', pwd[i][4])         tv.insert(' ', i, 'pwd_create_dt', pwd[i][2])         i += 1         count += 1   NOTE:  I get the following error, but when I use a print statement just to see if I can access each element like I am trying to do within the for loop it does not work.  But a stand alone print statement does work???   The error list just below this line references line 264 which is the first tv.insert line grabbing the 'company' data from the 'pwd[i][3]' element.  The reference on line 180 is the call to get_pwd_records() function where the for loop is found:   [ ERROR MSG ]   File ""/Users/timcurtin/python_projects/password_keeper_02.py"", line 180, in login_to_db     count = get_pwd_records(uid)   File ""/Users/timcurtin/python_projects/password_keeper_02.py"", line 264, in get_pwd_records     tv.insert(' ', i, 'company', pwd[i][3]) TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable   I am thinking it does not like the variable 'i' which is initially set to 0 but I am not sure at all really what the problem is.
