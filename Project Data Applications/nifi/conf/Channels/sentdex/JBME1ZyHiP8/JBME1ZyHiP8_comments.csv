@TooSweaty4U,2019-05-06T09:27:05Z,44,"Some suggestions for anybody following this tuto in 2019: You can update to use QT5 because not much has changed. I would suggest you to install pyside2 instead of PyQt (pip install pyside2, at least on python 3.7 on windows installed without a hitch). PySide2 is LGPL while PyQt is GPL so you can't sell any software using it unless you pay licensing fees.  Speaking of which, install QtPy (again, pip install qtpy, at least on python 3.7 on windows it installs just like that). QtPy allows you to code once and later decide if you want to use pyside1/2/QtPy4/QtPy5. You could start your app using PySide2 and only if you start making money you switch to QtPy and pay for licensing and support, all without changing a single line of code (at least that is the idea) thanks to QtPy.  To do this you need to change two easy things on this tutorial (because QtPy uses the new PyQt5 import names): -Change the import ""from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore"" to ""from qtpy import QtWidgets, QtGui, QtCore"" -Whenever sentdex says to use QtGui, use QtWidgets instead, the only excepction being QtGui.QIcon if I'm not mistaken.  That's it, you have a pretty nice quality of life update for this tutorial, amazing from sentdex, as usual.",True
