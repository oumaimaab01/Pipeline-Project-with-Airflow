@williamwright4028,2018-06-14T03:03:46Z,0,"Random AI observation.  Is anyone else under the impression that Apple's voice to text algorithm has actually become less accurate with recent versions or am I just crazy?  I believe that I read somewhere that they switched over from a Hidden Markov type model to a Deep Learning based model in the past few years and since then, it not only appears to be slower, but also doesn't seem to be as accurate.  Almost as if the model is overfitting.  Perhaps the wrong environment for the topic but I thought someone might have some input here.  Anyone?",True

@yondaime5685,2016-12-28T11:31:53Z,0,"Hello Sentdex. I'm relatively a new subscriber of yours and have gone through your many videos. You've helped me a lot and have given me a nice diving board to get into Data Science.  With that said, my question is what are the prospects of someone who has a Physics BS and soon to also have a MS in Applied Physics to get a job immediately in the world of data science? Would it be better to apply to data analyst positions first and then shoot for data scientist after experience? (I have tons of Matlab, Python, Stats, etc. experience. But they were for Physics purposes. I've been self-studying things like Pandas, SQLite3, etc. for the past two months or so.)  TL;DR/General-Question Thoughts on getting into the Data Science field without a CS degree or background? And a follow up question on how best to market onerself with that absence of CS degree?",True

@scarletovergods,2016-12-24T16:05:06Z,0,"In my view we, as humans, are suffering from what I would call a humancentric model of AI. Everybody seems to think intelligence means that one can make decisions and perform activities similar to the ones we make in our everyday life. Like driving a car, holding a meaningful conversation, recognizing objects etc. But in my view those abilities are very human-specific, the same way decisions Deep Blue made are very chess-specific. In order to have human AI a computer would have to develop millions of small human-specific 'intelligences' and then manage them with other 'intelligences' . For example reading is a very specific ability that only humans have and you could easily imagine intelligent entities going about their day without it. And that's true with almost anything we do. So going back to my main point people will soon realize that teaching computers how to behave like we do we would need to teach them how to do millions of very small and specific things (color-detection, recognizing facial expressions, pondering free will etc) instead of finding one key idea that opens all the doors.  And so another AI winter is coming...  If you could comment my view on AI that would be awesome :)",True
