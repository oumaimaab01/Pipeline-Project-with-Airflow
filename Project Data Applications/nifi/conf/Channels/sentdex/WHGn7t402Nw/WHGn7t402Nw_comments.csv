@edgarlarios1451,2020-07-09T20:03:27Z,0,don't know if I'll get a response but going to ask anyway.  I followed all of the steps but I keep getting communication error with rank 1. I edited my  machinefile and even made sure my second pi was getting by ssh key. what am I doing wrong,True
@kjeldgaard0,2019-03-17T11:30:48Z,0,"Instead of all the piping around 5:00, you should set the hostnames of all hosts using raspi-config. It also makes the necessary change in /etc/hosts, and prompts you to reboot the computer, so you don't need to mess with the shutdown command.",True

@tugrulmatras8368,2017-03-21T14:29:50Z,0,Thanks for this great tutorial. I have a question. Everything works fine when my master and slave computers are raspberry pi. But I could not manage to work using a regular Debian VM on PC as a master and 2 slave as raspberry. I receive error saying ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh_askpass): No such file or Directory Permission Denied,True
@PhilipposSlicher,2016-11-21T15:42:10Z,0,"I have everything setup with 2 of my pi's but regardless of what command I do it runs it on the master node just twice, any ideas?",True
@JackSimpsonJBS,2015-08-02T11:28:12Z,0,"Thank-you for the fantastic tutorial sentdex, I was wondering though how MPI knew which user to log onto the other Pis as? If all my computers are Pis with the username ""pi"" then it seems to know to use the same username and to go to the same directory. However, what should I do if I have a different username on another Pi or am even using a different linux distribution on the other computers? Thanks so much!",True
@Ciddyism,2015-05-14T09:07:43Z,0,added all nodes and servers to /etc/hosts: 192.168.1.2   NAS 192.168.1.100   Pi00 192.168.1.101   Pi01 192.168.1.102   Pi02  and wrote them to machinefile like this: Pi00 Pi01 Pi02  if I should ever move the IPs within my range or to another prefix I'll edit my hosts-file scp it to all nodes and I don't need to touch any machinefile - and I can use e.g. ssh Pi01,True
@sethconnell3497,2015-03-14T04:02:12Z,0,"Hey, I would just like to give everyone a tip. If you've used your sd cards for any other pi operating systems, you /will/ run into errors (i know because this happened with me). Because when you copy an sd card using disk imager, you also copy deleted partitions and this can be proverbial heck to fix. You're better off buying brand new sd cards that haven't been used for anything else.  Incidentally sentdex, great video. Your tutorial helped me complete a 3 node raspberry pi cluster (hoping to add even more). :]  ",True
@ChristianCharukiewicz,2015-02-28T21:34:27Z,1,"Awesome video series!  Is the only difference between the master node and the child nodes the contents of machinefile?  That is, the master node's machinefile should contain the IP addresses of all child nodes and each child node's machinefile will only contain a single IP address (the IP address of master)?",True
@OfficialAcidDrop,2015-02-16T14:43:55Z,0,"I don't intend to be mean, but no, this is not a real supercomputer.  This IS, however, a two node Beowulf cluster.  Beowulf cluster is an architecture for networking together several identical nodes of OTS (off-the-shelf) hardware.  This is an architecture commonly used for modern supercomputers, which is probably why you are making the confusion.",True
