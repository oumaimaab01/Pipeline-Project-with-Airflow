@lovechannel3380,2018-04-11T09:24:16Z,0,"Thanks for the videos. By the way, It's no bug! It's just that the colours for the quantiles 1 and 2 have been interchanged in the lower graph. Just Check the legends and you'll come to know.",True
@SebtorDude,2018-04-01T11:21:07Z,0,I don't know if this explains why the graphs look weird to you but I came across something interesting. I tested the same parameter with the USTradableStocks universe and split the securities into deciles. When you do this you see that the expected returns actually tend to climb with parameter deciles until you get to the top decile. Selecting stocks from the top decile actually seems to imply negative future returns.,True
@das250250,2017-08-18T15:17:47Z,0,"Also, the notebook doesn't seem to have a live auto fill editor like research does that can help narrow down syntax. It really needs a live ""helper"" to read your type or be asked "" what do you want to do ?"" and then takes you to something close suggested..",True
@das250250,2017-08-18T15:13:42Z,5,"There seem to be many layers of understanding required for this platform and so many packages that seem to just appear from nowhere without definition. I can take the cut and paste approach and hack my way through it but do so without any proper understanding of what the code is doing. I am bound to get into difficulty as I clearly have missed many finer details. My first starting point is scanning and filtering the available equities, controlling these filters and displaying them. I assume this happens in Notebook and I assume equities are housekept for stock splits and stock buyouts. Any tips welcome to get me in this zone ty",True
