@Sycord,2018-10-26T17:46:32Z,0,"I got a little improvement as well: So it's in the code like several videos, but what I found is in the build_assimilators method, the range for closer_than is set to high, so immediately 3 vespene geysers are built.

@Seeker265729,2018-07-17T07:08:45Z,0,"Certain units (and structures) have detection.  The OBSERVER is permanently cloaked but can be seen when in the detection radius of units with detection.  Also, if you play the game, you can actually see graphically where a moving cloaked unit is with higher graphics settings assuming that your 'screen' happens to be over that point at that time (i.e. cloaked units do not show up on the minimap).  I'm not sure if the api let's you 'know' the position of moving cloaked units or not but it might.  It should definitely let you see if you are in a detection radius assuming that you can see the detector with your observer.  I would also suggest adding a simple rule for an early probe scout, nothing can kill an early probe (with proper movement and positioning or the opponent loses a lot of mining time) until attacking units are produced.  If you just send an early probe off to check the enemy base you can probably have it just Dance around randomly until it does die and then send your observer in. Checking at least the timing of the enemy expansion(s) is very crucial for decision making later on, especially attack timing.",True

@archiatrus1093,2018-07-09T08:45:50Z,0,Just an idea: You could use the units radius for the circle radius. That should help with the overlapping except for flying units. https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2/blob/a7dd025d4dc3010dfa22e5622edf824f95d65e89/sc2/unit.py#L72,True

@parseeval,2018-07-08T06:45:13Z,0,"Hey, I just wondered two things: - would drawing everything with a certain alpha allow the AI to see ""how much"" of something there is? So it could learn, for example, what color an enemie space marine with one of our void rays hovering above it looks like - and be able to see more than one thing per pixel this way? Also this would allow us to not draw everything so ""oversized"", as the important things could still be seen when a lot of other things are around it. - I guess somewhere each entity type has a constant number - would'nt generating two color channels from this constant (like some kind of color hash) and using the 3rd one for the team allow us to shorten a lot of code? For the size one could go for the original size of the building or unit. What do you think?",True
@benjaminjaton3597,2018-07-08T02:23:53Z,0,"Previous comment is correct on observers: you can enable the surveillance mode but then they can't move. Each race has a few ways to reveal cloaked units: http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Detector . For example overlords are zerg flying units (kinda serves the same purpose as the pylon for protoss) that can detect cloaked units. Maybe it's possible to create a list of units/structures that can reveal the observers and somehow ""stay away from them"".",True

@Plaufin,2018-07-07T15:38:15Z,0,"When playing there's two ways to spot an observer, one is if it's moving (in the place you are looking at) where you can see somewhat of a strange effect on screen, and the second one is when it's not loving you can zoom and  unzoom your camera and you will see somewhat different.

@user-rl6ox2tt5s,2018-07-07T14:36:08Z,2,"As always, great video! Can't get, why you are doing this: x += ((random.randrange(-20, 20))/100) * enemy_start_location[0] y += ((random.randrange(-20, 20))/100) * enemy_start_location[1] As I understand, you are trying to get 20% variance around enemy's location, but if the enemy is in the left-top corner, you are going to get high variance around y-axis, because enemy_start_location[1] is large and low variance around x-axis, because enemy_start_location[0] is low, and if enemy's location is in the bottom-left, you are also going to get a good variance only around x-axis.
