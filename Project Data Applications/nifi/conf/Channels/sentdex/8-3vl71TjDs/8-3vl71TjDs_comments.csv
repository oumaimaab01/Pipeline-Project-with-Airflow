@static75,2018-04-08T17:51:02Z,0,"Two questions:  1)  At 4:42 in your video, you can see that the background starts to slowly and automatically adjust after you repositioned the camera. When I run this code, the original frame tends to stay locked-in, regardless of how long I let it run.  How did you get background to dynamically adjust and ""fade out""?   Question 2)  Even this apparent fade-out is still not 100% adjusted to the new camera angle.  Take a closer look at your right hand at 5:02.  The ""fg"" image clearly shows a line through your right hand when there is actually nothing there - it's just a wall.  This line comes from the very first image that was captured.

@zikeymashup9433,2016-11-16T08:14:40Z,0,"Hai +sentdex, I've been going through the first tutorial and I'm loving all the tutorial that you gave. It helps me a lot in understanding python and openCV. Starting from tutorial 14 I'm stumble upon some error that required me to include this line ""cv2.ocl.setUseOpenCL(False)"" right after import cv2 that is recommended by people from the comments.   My question will be, is the problem occurs because of my un-updated python? I'm currently using python27 and opencv_3.10.   And for this particular tutorial, I'm having some error => ""cv2.imshow('original', frame)  cv2.error: C:\builds\master_PackSlaveAddon-win32-vc12-static\opencv\modules\highgui\src\window.cpp:281: error: (-215) size.width>0 && size.height>0 in function cv::imshow"".
