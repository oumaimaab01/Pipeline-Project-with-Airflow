@elvsrbad2,2020-06-27T17:52:06Z,0,"Since we don't have to worry about local minimums Instead of stepping through to look for the minimum, why can't we just find the point where the slope is = 0?",True

@smalldragons7893,2019-06-26T10:51:26Z,5,"Hey, thx for the great tutorial. But why do we use w=[5,5]? A w with equal elements actually decide the slope of the hyperplane at the beginning? How can we decide the slope at the first place?",True

@andreswang6666,2018-11-07T19:37:14Z,2,"Can this also apply to data with more than 2 features? I mean if we use that [1,1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1] matrix, it'll expand exponentially with more number of features.",True

@Lucas-ss5xi,2017-07-15T17:34:21Z,5,why don't we take the derivative (slope) at each step so that we know in which direction there is the global minimum and so we don't overshoot?,True
@iyrfify,2017-06-18T15:05:42Z,0,Whats the difference between w * x + b and w*x + b = 0 (or 1 or -1)? Why using equal sign in one of them and not the other...are they both hyperplanes?,True
@dorsolomon7251,2017-06-12T09:31:37Z,0,?can we use the monta carlo method to find M and b,True
@winterhand9394,2017-06-03T10:52:13Z,7,"if w = [5,5], you mentioned that we must also test the vectors [5,-5], [-5,-5] and [-5,5]. However shouldn't we be testing all the vectors with a magnitude of sqrt(50)?",True

@ewyg,2016-05-22T21:26:46Z,0,pressed like as usual.,True
@blacknoirschwarz,2016-05-21T17:07:38Z,1,Great project so far! Will you be using SMO and work with some kernel or will you be using SGD on the primal form (with e.g. hinge loss)? It would be very interesting to show how you could parallize or distribute SVMs (f.e. PEGASOS as an mapreduce SGD algorithm; or I think LIBLINEAR uses  some form of dual cooardinate descent).,True
@VictorKyalo,2016-05-21T16:49:40Z,2,I wish you would be doing it with some example code,True
