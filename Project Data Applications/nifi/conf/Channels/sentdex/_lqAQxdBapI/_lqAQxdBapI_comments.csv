@DarkRedman31,2021-07-02T17:21:26Z,1,"32:18 I guess you're not yet a ""power use"" of Sublime Text, I would have selected ""ans"" do Ctrl+D twice to select the other two occurrences and type answer 34:39 To precise a space for the first split argument is facultative since it's its default value. 38:10 instead of list comprehension you can fix it with a set comprehension. Well not, you can use set(words) on line 19 like for word in set(words) Btw I was surprised by results because in your test it doesn't print ""up"" twice before it shows the list and looking at your code I don't get why it's filtered, but once fixed it should give the result 3 for total repetitions. 44:27 In the sorted function call you add the argument reverse=True 49:37 I faced this issue and found a solution, you can do from collections import most_common and do print(most_common(my_dict, 5)) to get the top 5 values, if you want the index of the best value (when not sorted) you can convert your dict to list of tuples with list(my_dict) use numpy.argmax() on it and use numpy slicing to filter the second column (of values)",True

@andytang7725,2020-10-21T15:12:51Z,0,"Hi Sentdex,  Here are some recent paper that you may find helpful regarding non-greedy decoding.    - (nucleus / top-p sampling) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09751.pdf    - (self-terminating training) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02492.pdf  tl;dr:  Beam search (along with similar maximization schemes) does NOT seem to work very well during decoding, provided that you've trained using maximum likelihood (MLE).   This is even true for extremely expressive generative models such as GPT-2, whose training was based on MLE and did not incorporate penalty against repetition. The second paper recommends a different learning objective that incorporates such penalties and seem to work well for RNN-type models.  Instead, consider using either top-k sampling or nucleus sampling during decoding, as they are agnostic to model architecture (i.e., can be adapted to RNNs or transformers, and can be used regardless of the learning objective(s)). It is also easier to implement since you do not need to re-train on 400mil pairs using fancy objectives.  They have shown great promise in recent packages like Microsoft's DialoGPT (dialog version of GPT-2), which was also trained on Reddit convos.

@farookjintha9436,2020-03-31T18:11:29Z,0,"I just waited for this. I had stucked on my project of chatbot using tf . I took a course on Udemy to build chatbot , the author did it in TF1  whereas I would like to do in TF2 with all attention mechanism . But I continued with the course on building chatbot, at one point of time , I had error like Module not found , since he used TF1.4 I couldn't install that version, since no such version for now, atleast to mimic wht he's doing. So wht to do? How can I build chatbot using Seq2Seq model using TF2 with attention mechanisms. (Note: Not a NMT model to translate, but a chatbot model to give response to the user queries)",True
