@mattizzle81,2020-10-28T05:04:04Z,0,"Can't beat the price, but even the original Jetson nano was too underpowered for me. The type of stuff that I like to work on requires two things which are difficult to achieve. Needs to be portable and convenient like a smartphone, but have more GPU power than a smartphone.   These are compact but not really portable or rugged like a phone. No built in battery, no built in camera, screen, etc.   My Jetson Nano is just collecting dust. I much prefer doing live streaming of video, audio, other sensors from a smartphone to a powerful desktop machine. Writing the custom code I have for the live streaming is a bit difficult and not for beginners, but I like the results of that set-up a lot better.",True

@ighor,2020-10-14T18:34:02Z,5,"Nvidia released Linux kernel 4.9.140 patches for its ARM linux devices 2 years ago, and there was no new kernel updates since then. You can't install a newer Linux kernel with support of Wi-Fi 6. And you need to know that Nvidia stops releasing updates for their old devices. And if you ask Nvidia on their forum, about when new kernel support going to be released, they will tell you ""Customer can try to do that by their own"". https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/ubuntu-19-10-with-kernel-5-3-0-18-on-jetson-nano/107619/2 Jetson Nano runs on the 5 years old hardware, since it is using the same GPU and CPU as used in the first revision of Nintendo Switch, but JN has 2 times less GPU core count. When buying this you should be ready that you may stuck on the kernel 4.9.140 forever with no kernel security patches. If you agree with Ubuntu to install all updates to v20 it will break all the GPU drivers. And when you want to update their SDK and drivers, there is no other way yet, but to flash a new image to a microSD card again and loose all settings. If you wish to use this device as part of your project, remember, its missing 2 years of kernel patches so its may be vulnerable to hacker attacks.",True
