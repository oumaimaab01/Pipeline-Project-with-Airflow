Unfortunately all I can do is turn on/off Bose. It doesn't support volume or changing channels, but I believe that is due to the particular speaker I have.... Worth getting if you already have other devices to use it with... I don't sit around and ask Alexa questions much so that doesn't really matter to me....",True

Although, to state, I only ask it for jokes and the weather. I did say Alexa what are you wearing and the voice said I don't have any clothes.  I laughed till my gut burst. Too funny. However, serious, the A.I.  technology coming out now is incredible. Or am I stupid asking a hockey puck what it is wearing?.... Too hilarious.!! I may write a screenplay about this thing. (I screen write). I don't get the weird laughs that apparently comes from it now.  I'm disappointed.",True

@kennethjohnsen9005,2017-11-25T11:12:55Z,2,"Amazon echo is an AI SJW! It means white people are racists, women are victims of men, there are many more than two genders, it refers to Wikipedia wich is not verified correct information, it glorifies communism and other socialist ideologies, basically Lenin, Stalin and Mao are good guys who did no wrong, Jesus was a fictional caracter, and Muhammed was a very respected prophet. It basically is an ideological executor looking to brainwash anyone who cant read  or think for themselves wich is most people who has gone through basic schooling in the west. People lack the ability to think critically and reasonable. Todays students learn and belive that having emotions is a way of thinking, wich is kinda right, but reasonable thinking must be done without emotions. There is a saying wich goes like this; The wise are instructed by reason, average minds by experience, the stupid by necessity and the brute by instinct. I fear that reason has been thrown out the window in schools of the west...",True
