@ardawanx,2018-11-10T03:32:33Z,0,Please explain How do you calculate the amount of FLOPS ? How many GFLOPS you got from those 2 RPIs?  Thank you,True
@dutta.alankar,2017-01-10T05:11:59Z,0,I have two Desktops instead of Pi. Both has Ubuntu 16.10 running. Can I follow along? What are the different things I must do?,True
@kuntalmajumder5310,2016-06-10T13:36:45Z,0,"+sentdex U r really awesome , I was thinking of using 2 spare mobos and an amd HD5450 with my laptop for super computing (rendering frames of animation) . Can i use that instead of the raspberry pi's , with normal linux distibutions?  Also you did some tutorials NLTK , does that mean u r going to do some tutorials with CMUSphinx? That way we could use a bunch of pi-s with mics and spread them all over the house and pretend to be Tony Stark? Isnt it?",True
@wesleyhur3880,2016-05-02T01:34:48Z,0,What model should i get? By the way nice series! AND CHANNEL.,True
@cacheflex8033,2015-08-18T04:05:20Z,2,"I'll watch the whole series for sure. But just one thing. I got to your channel by searching for some automated trading programing lessons. And here I am stalking your whole videos haha. What woud be a great supercomputer set up for trading? And one last thing, how high frequency trading works and can it be applied to this affordable supercomputer? Thanks a lot.",True
@daddywoofdawg,2015-08-16T16:50:23Z,0,How do you connect the pi's together.Never looked at one.Other tan robots is the another home use for this set-up? How good would a raspberry PI stack work for a CNC machine?Or would a standard computer work better?Just kicking around some thoughts and don't know what the Raspberry pi in stacks would be good for.,True
@fredyharter6293,2015-04-05T15:26:11Z,0,"Hello Harrison! While thinking to build my supercomputer I was wondering if you know whether or not I can use an old laptop as screen and keyboard plugging the laptop to the raspberry pi. And if you know, how to do it?  Also I noticed in one of your website pictures (at http://pythonprogramming.net/dashboard/ in the 'Robotics' tab at the 'Build a Supercomputer and Program it with MPI' tab) that you have a 5 ports switch but 6 raspberry pies. As I was thinking to buy 6 raspberries as well I was wondering whether I should better buy an 8 ports switcher than a 5 ports one.  Lastly, I wondered if you plug the switcher to your modem (or router)? Then we should envisage the need for a seventh port assuming the other 6 ports were plugged to computers.",True
@kedwa30,2015-01-22T20:01:48Z,0,"Nice video. I'll watch the whole series, but just wanted to go ahead and post. I am more interested in how to do it in general than how to do it with Raspberry Pi. I have one Raspberry Pi and one Beagle Bone Black and I was hoping to find information that would let me put the two together in a way that they could work as one dual core computer. I have seen several videos on making a cluster of Pi's, but they don't explain much. They pretty much copy Tinkernut's how-to. Well, I hope yours is going to be different and explain more. Here is one point you should go into more detail about. The i7 uses complex instruction set core (CISC) while the Pi uses reduced instruction set core (RISC) and anyone please correct me if I have it wrong because I'm still learning. Macs and every phone uses the RISC architecture because it is more power efficient. The Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, and all the specialized Bitcoin mining computers all use RISC as opposed to CISC and even the GPU onboard CISC computers uses RISC. The Raspberry Pi has a GPU as well which is typically not utilized for these clusters which are hooked together using only the ethernet port. That's a shame because the PI also has a nice set of connectors for input from a camera and output to a screen which could be used to increase bandwidth from one Pi to another. There are also GPIO pins that from the videos I have seen are not utilized. It's like they are missing out on several bites of Pi. We have to eat all that Pi goodness to truly show what the RaspPi can do. So I think that if you interconnect them in new ways and utilize the GPU for processing you can really increase the FLOPS. Now for my purpose, I am only interested in making a desktop computer that can be easily upgraded by adding additional nodes to the cluster. The way it is now, if I have a quad core AMD and I want to get more cores, I have to take out the quad core CPU and buy a compatible CPU with more cores. Also, if I have all the slots filled with 1 gig ram modules and I want more ram I have to take out some modules in order to add more. I think there is a better way. In the future, people will upgrade both CPU and RAM by simply adding more cores to the cluster as easily as adding more USB ports by plugging in a hub. For now, we have to figure out how to make that happen. Since you posted your video, the Raspberry Pi A+ was released, which brings the cost of building a cluster way down. Oh, there is only one USB port. No problem. On a cluster of 6 there will be 6 USB ports. Want to use more than one monitor? No problem. Each Pi has its own HDMI output. In a cluster of six, you could have six monitors. Wouldn't that be awesome for gaming? While the Raspberry Pi doesn't have the best specs as far as single board computers go, that is okay because we should be able to use different boards in the same cluster. The Beagle Bone Black, while having better specs in general, does not have a GPU. It also uses a micro HDMI, so kind of a pain and expense to get the cable. This is where mixing boards really shines. Say you want to have 4 monitors and 6 cores in your system. Then have 4 Raspberry Pi and 2 Beagle Bone Blacks. You could even have a Banana Pi in the mix.  Finally, if you're going to be making a cluster, then use a standard PC power supply. You will get more than enough power and you won't have the power plug jungle. If you are only going to use two then you can get a single 3 amp plug. Those often come with USB hubs. ;)",True

@dave1231100,2014-06-26T22:09:35Z,0,So positive until the end when you are practically admitting the Pi is not so good as a supercomputer.,True
