@swiffty1,2015-11-19T03:01:59Z,0,"What happens if you have another template lets say ""gallery.html"". How do you tell the HTML index page that you want that gallery page and how does it know where to place it within the document? I noticed there was only one {{ block body }} {{ endblock }} ""tag"" in the ""header.html""  file. So if you had many {{ block body }} {{ endblock }} ""tags"" how would the ""header.html"" page know the order in which to apply the templates?",True
@vincecooley7808,2015-09-05T15:39:54Z,3,"Hey Harrison, thank you so much for the tutorials.  I'm having a trouble getting this working as you have it written (I copy pasted the example code). When I try to extend the header, I get a 500 error. If I just remove the {% extends ""header.html"" %} from dashboard.html, the page loads, though it is rendered improperly. Anyone have insight into what is causing this problem? Thanks for your time.",True
