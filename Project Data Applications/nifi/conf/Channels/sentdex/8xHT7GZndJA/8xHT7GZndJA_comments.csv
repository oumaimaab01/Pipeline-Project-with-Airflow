@kenosabi,2020-07-25T19:52:32Z,3,"This was all incredibly confusing. You have a ton of knowledge which is great. But what happens is it leads to random tangents. It happens at least a few times a video and these are short videos. So say you spend a literal minute on the random tangent that you state we ""don't need to know yet"" as your saying it. After you do this 3 or 4 times in 12 minute video 1/3 of the video becomes irrelevant information that only leads to confusion. When your learning something new you only get so many ""spoons"" a day. The spoons are too valuable to be spent on information not currently needed for today's learning. I think you would really benefit from working out a flow chart for the vid and then forcing yourself to stick to it or edit out whatever isn't needed. Like writing clean code.   All in all tho I appreciate you taking the time. Its awesome of you. Being able to teach others clearly and concisely is a skill in itself that does take developing. I think youll accomplish some great things here with time.",True
@rshparmar4962,2020-07-24T13:37:29Z,2,"Whoever didn't understand the Just_display. Let me explain Just_display is a boolean which by default is false .. and when in the if condition where if not  just_display comes which means if just display is false then only run the next line of code so by default, the code will run because just display is false by default and if we set it to true when we called it at last in the function by setting gameboard(just_display=True) the code will not run because it will only run when just_display is false. remember by default its false The purpose of doing this is if we want to display the game map without changing the values of the gameboard by the default values which are 0  here.

@nrm7747,2020-04-19T10:58:43Z,1,"Guys I myself had the doubt about the just display parameter. I cleared it with help from discord members. So the just_display parameter is a luxury for just displaying. We can simply just display the gameboard by setting the player,row and column value to 0 and just typing gameboard() as sentdex had done initially. But we use just_display parameter because when our code becomes much more complicated we might not remember how we can just display the gameboard; Hence using a just_display parameter is handy.",True

@ajitesh764,2019-06-29T13:07:09Z,4,"I don't mean any offence but after going through many videos in this basic series I feel this series is good only if one is familiar with basic, not completely new to python. You show what's happening but do not explain the basic of why something is happening. Watching your videos after Corey Schafers basics video actually gives a better understanding of your videos. For instance in one video when u introduced 'global' you didn't actually explain it in detail. Had I not watched Corey's video on LEGB rule I couldn't have understood the significance of it, and only learned how to use but not why to use it. So what I do now is I first see what topic you're going to teach and then watch Corey's video on that topic and then see it's application here, it gives a better feel of what you teach. It's just my own thought about this basic series and nothing personal.  What is the significance of just_display??.... player  !=0 was more clear.",True

I was able to fix it by declaring a = 0, b = 1, c = 2,  this allowed me to feed a,b,c as the column parameter without it getting pissy at me.",True
