I've been trying to figure out a way to find batch_size that the tuner found the best results with, but I've been unsuccessful.  Can you comment on that?  I watched your video several times and don't think you mentioned anything about batch size, which is a very common parameter to test with.  I looked up several articles and haven't found any information on that either.  I also haven't found any information on how to add batch size as a parameter for the tuner.  So the only thing I can think of is to run the tuner multiple times for the varying batch sizes, but I'm sure there's a better way.",True

@bhuvaneshs.k638,2019-12-23T14:18:07Z,0,"This is computationally expensive.... !!!! So is this random search done with 1 or 2 epoch n we note down parameters... Finally while we save model we do traditional method with 20-50 epochs or so... N load these parameters...? Can u explain max trials, execution per trials ??.... Say 4 epochs... So for each epoch, execution per trial is done ??",True

@nano7586,2019-12-22T10:04:41Z,0,"I ALWAYS wondered how there is no optimizer for hyperparameters. People working with neural networks and machine learning but talking about ""trial and error"" when it comes to HYPER and not HYPO parameters. This always really confused me. It's basically like applying a neural network to the neural network. Sure, it takes a long time and is CPU/GPU expensive, but if needed you can run it overnight or even for longer times. But that also overfits your model to the validation data you are using for optimization, right? Anyways, thanks so much for sharing!",True

@billfujimoto5905,2019-12-21T22:44:17Z,0,"This reminds me of gridsearch in scikit-learn. I tried following your tutorial, but when the training completes on the first trial i.e. after the tuner.search function, the code crashes when trying to write the results, at least that is what I can make of the traceback which is very ugly.  Did you have any issues here?  I'm using Win10 no gpu.  I tried deleting and recreating a new conda environment with TF2 and Python 3.7 but still no go.",True
