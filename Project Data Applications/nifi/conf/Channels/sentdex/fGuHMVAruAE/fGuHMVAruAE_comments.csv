@batman4797,2018-08-07T21:43:42Z,1,"Hey guys, after a bit of research and with the help of this video, It all depends on your python bit version so if you have installed python(32-bit) then make sure the packages you install are of 32 bits how to know your python version? you can just type python on the windows search box, the bit version will be visible with the python application's name.",True

@alainghawi9122,2017-03-31T12:32:36Z,0,Thanks a lot for this very helpful video. You are right about it because I installed opencv x64 instead of x86. After watching the video and stumbling upon the same error i knew how to fix it by simply replacing the file by a 32-bit version instead of 64-bit. Thanks a lot again.,True
