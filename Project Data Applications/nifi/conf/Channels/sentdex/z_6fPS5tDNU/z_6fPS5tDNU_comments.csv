Images that are no longer hosted quickly show as a 404 error, the code automates the download of the ""This photo is no longer available"" icon (which you go over how to get rid of in the next vid, I believe) and the code moves on to the next URL. However, some of the images are still hosted on what appear to be the world's slowest servers lol  Is there a ""timeout"" function that could be added to this script, so if the download takes longer than, for example, 30 seconds, the script would cancel that download and move on to the next URL? I've been stuck on image 572 of a 1932 image synset for close to 15 minutes, and I'm too new to Python to know how to make the code move on!
