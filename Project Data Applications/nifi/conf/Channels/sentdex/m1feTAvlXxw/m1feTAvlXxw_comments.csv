@wurstelei1356,2023-08-22T23:09:40Z,0,"Thanks for this nice video. To me it is very helpful. I got 1 question: in the beginning, you specify auto as place to load the model, but later you do to(""cude""). Wouldn't that fail for CPU ? Anyway, with your Gradio issue you could ask StableCoder or Falcoder about that, or one of the larger Llama models. Maybe they provide a usefull answer. Thou Falcoder at least isn't that good at such things as far as I checked it. But I'm a noob, could be that I made something wrong.",True
