@bhairajagautam3505,2019-06-28T09:27:50Z,0,"Hey, I am working for similar project but in FIFA, but the problem is it cannot detect the key pressed(keyboard) when the window if focused on FIFA ,but detects the key if it is focused on Pycharm or the opencv window. Any help regarding that issue?",True

@jyashi1,2019-04-01T16:18:29Z,0,"When i run the grabscreen code i run into an error ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 1440000 into shape (900,1600,4). I know this is because img is a 1 row 1440000 column vector and height and width for me is 900 and 1600. But i am curious why Harrison didn't run into the same problem. Im not sure what i should change to match the array sizes.",True

@alexboitor5699,2017-11-20T16:46:25Z,0,"@sentdex Hello, I'm watching the tutorial series just now and i love it! about the line detection, i tried the following and it worked decently: i split the image vertically and found the longest line on each (with check for the slope to be different than zero or inf).",True
@LGBKAI,2017-09-15T08:33:39Z,0,"Couldn't you ""generate"" train data with the NPC traffic nodes ? I know GTA:V has a mod which lets you ""auto-drive"" by using the NPC traffic nodes ingame. So you wouldn't have to train it itself, and automate that step.",True
@b4ux1t3-tech,2017-08-27T00:08:56Z,8,"What I find most impressive about this project is that it works so well (hahaha) while only using one input (the player camera). Real-life self-driving cars use a whole suite of sensors to figure out how to stay on the road. Now, obviously this isn't a good comparison; this is a video game, in the end, he's not going to hurt anyone. But it's really cool how you thought to approach limited tooling (just one sensor) in order to build something that works (somewhat).  Great series!",True

@VLS-Why,2017-04-28T03:12:10Z,1,If the keyboard turning is too extreme for steering could you use a joystick/controller emulator? That way you could use analog values and even implement a PID function.,True

@user-vr3gn2hy2m,2017-04-20T21:40:05Z,0,"sent, the reason u found win32 so much better than cv2 most likely lies with cv2's slow behavior  rather than with py32win superiority. =D I recently had a pleasure working with images and occasionally found out that loading images with cv2 4 times slower than with scipy.misc.imread for example.",True
@DanTup,2017-04-20T19:26:39Z,33,I chuckled at 1:36 where a car has to drive around you so you then pull your scooter out of the way like the AI drivers might get annoyed by your obstruction =),True

@jacobdavidcunningham1440,2017-04-19T16:22:23Z,0,"Is there a video yet of the scooter driving or not? It is pretty awesome how you were able to interface with the game with the ability to turn off traffic and what not. I'm kind of curious how you're going to do the turning, is it a form of computer vision/obstacle detection. I like this idea though you could train machines to drive in the real world in simulations like GTA V, not sure how good that would be no perhaps not as random as the real world.",True
