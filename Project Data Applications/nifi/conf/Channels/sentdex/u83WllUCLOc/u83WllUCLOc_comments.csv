@antoniozeus4,2014-03-09T20:28:12Z,0,"Mr. Sentdex - would the missing data be due to the fact that we start plotting from our longest Moving Average? Therefore, a 200 period moving average wouldn't plot the full 10 year data or 3 year data... just a thought",True

@sentdex,2013-09-25T16:21:28Z,0,"There are a few ways you could do this, but the easiest would be to just plot the text on the axis. Not too sure the best way to ""mark"" the candle, but you could probably plot some sort of marker as well other than a line, like a dot or x to denote it then have the text under.  I can eventually do a tutorial on that, but I am pretty far backlogged. I'll try to slip it in somewhere",True
