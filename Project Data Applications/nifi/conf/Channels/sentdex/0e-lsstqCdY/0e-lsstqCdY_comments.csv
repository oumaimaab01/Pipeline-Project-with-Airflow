(weeks or months)  in my case for many weeks or months, for example Kawamoto Corporation stock before it spike parabolic recently as you can see in the chart attached.  Note that before it went parabolic just two weeks ago, it has almost No volatily for many Weeks,  Macd line is almost equal to its signal line for all that time.  I need a program that can filter those stocks  among all the stocks in the NYSE and Canada and London Markets, is that possible?  Once I find such a stock I will check it every week to determine when is the time to buy it. As for example with Kawamoto corp.  If you code this program for me I can tell you how to determine when to buy a stock before it goes up.  or you can give me your email so I will inform you when to buy such stock, so you can profit too.  i could Not insert here the chart so please visit the following link choose kawamoto corp. select Week periods and leave only Macd indicator besides candle sticks, so you can see what I am talking about. thanks a lot. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/3604/charts?countrycode=jp",True
