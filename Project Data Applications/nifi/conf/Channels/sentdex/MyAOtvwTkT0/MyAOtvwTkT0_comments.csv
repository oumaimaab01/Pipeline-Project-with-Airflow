@saatweek,2020-12-21T06:49:51Z,0,"About cv.waitKey() if the parameter value is 0, then it waits for a key to be pressed, if the value is anything other than 0, say 25, then it'll wait for 25ms for a key to be pressed (before closing the instance) If you press a key before the elapsed time (25ms  in this case), then (and this is important) **it returns the 32 bit integer corresponding to the pressed key** (or  -1 if no key was pressed before the specified time had elapsed). ord('q') returns the Unicode code point of q. 0xFF is the hexadecimal number of 255, whose binary is expressed by 00000000000000000000000011111111 (32 bits) & 0xFF performs the bit-wise AND operation and effectively masks the variable (the return value of waitKey()) so it leaves only the value in the last 8 bits, and ignores all the rest of the bits Therefore  When you write cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF == ord('q'), then this is what actually happens..  When you press 'q' before 25ms, the return value of cv2.waitKey() would be equal to the unicode code point of 'q', and hence the statement will be executed  Final Tip : You can ignore & 0xFF and simply write if cv.waitKey(25) == ord('q') and it'll work just the same, That filter/mask of & 0xFF is pretty unnecessary",True

@FastNotSave,2017-08-23T18:56:32Z,2,"+sentdex AFAIK the cv::waitKey function handles the window message processing. Window messages are used to tell the window if it should rerender its content, if it has been moved or resized, if there is any IO (like key press) and so on. This means, if you don't call waitKey, all windows created by OpenCV won't process their pending messages and thus cannot rerender.  The parameter passed to waitKey defines the timespan (in ms)  that OpenCV is allowed to process its messages (at least). For example: if you call waitKey(1), OpenCV will run the message loop for AT LEAST 1ms. A call to waitKey() always processes all pending messages (since its last invokation). After all pending messages are processed, OpenCV checks if there is time left and if so, it starts another processing loop (in case new messages already occured).",True
