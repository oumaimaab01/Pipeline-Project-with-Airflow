@DanielWilliams-fp4oz,2016-05-13T20:36:19Z,0,Thanks for the videos. I have a 3D plot that I generate from a 2D list of data. The data values are the Z coordinates at that point. It has very abrupt and sharp corners though. Can you do a video on how to smooth that out? With some interpolation or something. I can't seem to find anything useful.,True

@sentdex,2015-07-21T14:34:21Z,1,"***** Any time you find someone apparently just using magic numbers, the first stop should be documentation. Here, we're using np.linspace. Just google that, and you'll wind up here: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html. From there, you can see the first 2 nums are ""start"" and ""stop,"" then the 3rd parm is called ""num."" Via documents, num is the number of samples to generate, default would be 50.",True
