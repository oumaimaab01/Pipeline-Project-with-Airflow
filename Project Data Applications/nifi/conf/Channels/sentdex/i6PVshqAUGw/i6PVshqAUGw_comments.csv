@minjun87,2016-06-01T23:23:48Z,0,"Hello Sentdex,   Sorry for giving you many questions here and there, but I have to figure this out.  So I have a linux server I rent from Digital Ocean and I have set up everything followed by your tutorials. Now, in my windows 10 laptop computer, I want to connect to the linux server to access the mysql databases in that sever. For that, I first, in the linux server, granted my local windows computer ALL permissions with the ip address that I am connected to right now. And in python, I wrote conn = MySQLdb.connect(""xxx.xxx.xxx.x"", ""new_username"", ""new_password"", ""database name"" ) But this does not work. I tried ""new_username$database name"" also. Not working. It give me this error message: OperationalError: (2003, ""Can't connect to MySQL server on 'xxx.xxx.xxx.x' (10061)"")  What went wrong?",True
