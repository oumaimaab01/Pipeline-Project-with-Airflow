I would like my algorithm,  already linked to Robinhood of course, to sell that stock if it hits $5.00 per share. Is there a simple way to do this? Thank you in advance.",True
@DurgeshSakhardande,2017-06-30T19:42:37Z,0,Is less number of trades is because the optimized code is scheduled weekly vs previous codes was scheduled to rebalance daily ?,True

@furrheul1989,2017-03-02T19:21:30Z,4,"Have been waiting for this course for some time:). Provides one with the perfect start for some more experimenting in algorithmic trading (which in the end is of course the best way to go about). Also have to give some credit to the Quantopian team that provide us with this unbelievable platform (for free!).   But as said, thank you too Harrison for another well structured and fun tutorial. All these real life cases are a very nice way to learn about programming and implementing it at the same time. For me this works better than the (in my opinion) still somewhat too theoretical way that most online course platforms go about teaching. I also like the fact that you sometimes get stuck, which will actually happen quite a lot when you do things by yourself. After learning Python, mostly via your tutorials I have recently been trying some projects out myself, which is something that I can definitely recommend everyone else as well.",True
@xxsugarysaltxx,2017-02-23T01:19:01Z,0,"Hi Harrison! I was backtesting a trading algo using Quantopian, and I keep getting several warnings that ""Your order for [x] shares of [company] failed to fill by the end of day and was canceled."" Do you know the solution to this? I couldn't find much online, and was thinking you may be able to point me in the right direction. Thanks so much!",True
