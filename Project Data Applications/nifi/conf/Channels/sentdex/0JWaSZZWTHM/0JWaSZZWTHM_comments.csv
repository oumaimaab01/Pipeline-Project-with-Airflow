@willgale8889,2018-09-28T17:05:47Z,0,"Building and installing the object detection API does work, you just have to change the import at the top from:  ""from utils import label_map_util from utils import visualization_utils as vis_util""  to  ""from object_detection.utils import label_map_util From object_detection.utils import visualization_utils as vis_util"" (And any other things from utils you want)  The first one I think is looking for the ""utils"" folder that is in the object detection API, but it isn't there when running this script from a different directory (unless you copy and paste the whole folder) but once it is built and installed it puts the object detection folder in your site-packages meaning to access it you just need to add ""object_detection."" to whatever you want to access. When I first tried building/installing the object detection API, it didn't work and after changing these lines of code it worked fine.  If this wasn't the problem then ignore everything I just said.

@realArisawaHeavyInd,2018-09-28T03:36:30Z,2,"Hey Dex, just joined the channel, really really great content, has been a HUGE help with learning how to navigate Tensorflow. Haven't been through all of your Keras stuff yet, so forgive me if what I'm about to suggest has already been covered. I went through your original tflow obj detection API tutorial, have a model trained on a bunch of custom data with the goal to draw bounding boxes on streaming video. My question is: the Keras tutoral makes no mention (at least as far as I've seen...) of training models on images with attached TFRecord (or XML, whatever) annotation data. Is there anything in the works to add bounding box prediction to the Keras stuff you're doing? I'm a noob (and haven't actually finished watching this vid yet, so I may end up having to just delete this comment if you beat me to it >_>), so forgive me if there's something obvious I'm missing here... Either way, love your content, keep it up, man.",True
