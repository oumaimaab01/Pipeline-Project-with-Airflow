If you take a peek at /materialize-src/sass/components you'll find a .scss file called _navbar.scss. When lurking around here I noticed that it refers to something called $primary-color. Now that means that somewhere within the sass folder we're setting a primary color. I lurked around a bit more... and found that we do exactly that in the _variables.scss file. If you proceed to open this file you'll find that it is setting $primary-color to materialize-red.   All you need to do now is change that to whatever color you want, so there's no need to mess with the color configurations! Compile using Koala and you're good to go.",True

Management scripts, add management options to your app/data using the manage.py CLI.
