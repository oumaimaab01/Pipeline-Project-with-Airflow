Do you know which of these CPUs will perform better in machine learning and data science tasks, no need to say I would use a Nvidia GPU like 3070 besides the cpu, but I wanna choose an appropriate cpu for these types of tasks. These are my choices: 1. 5900X:       $250 (used) 2. 13600KF:   $400 (used) 3. 13700KF:   $500 (new) But as you know there is another  important factor,  GPU. if I choose the 5900x then I could spend the extra money on a better GPU. If I wanna summarize both CPU and GPU configuration I afford are these three options: 1. 5900X + 3080Ti 2. 13600KF + 3070Ti 3. 13700KF + 3060 / 3060Ti  which one should be a better combination?",True

I‚Äôm trying to buy a desktop to do scientific computing (my day job) and video editing (which I do for a friend). The only people who review desktops are gamers, and while I share some criteria in common with gamers, I also place a premium on reliability because this is my work machine. I work at home for a startup, and I use AWS - you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs expensive. I want to buy my own desktop in part to help my startup save money. I don‚Äôt need this much horsepower‚Ä¶I was looking at more like a P340 or P520. When I see Lenovo charging $300-400 for an extra 8GB RAM over the base model (4 or 8GB, depending on model), I get frustrated and feel like I should just build my own machine. Plus they‚Äôre using laptop GPUs in those machines, and I‚Äôm not sure if those are worth their cost. But then I worry about reliability if I build my own. Anyway, thank you for this video. I know it‚Äôs a bit old now, but I really appreciate it. I‚Äôm still not sure what route to go - pre-built vs. building my own, and if pre-built, what brand - but this video has been helpful.",True

A single socket Epyc has 128 lanes, and you can literally get 24 cores for like... half the price of one of those CPUs on a single socket CPU that would give you more than 2x the PCI-e lanes, a complete fraction of the power draw, and way easier to cool.  Hell, you could get 64 cores for the price that you paid for 16. Would it be clock speed?  I just don't get where the money is going for those CPUs and would really like to know more.

What CPU, what Nvidia, how much ram? What else is important?  With your setup,  what kind of problems can be tackled?   I mean network structure  (# of layers, # of  neurons?).  How big are the datasets you work with (rows and columns)?  How long are your training times?  Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my questions. Your videos are great extremely and helpful.  John.david.deatherage@gmail.com",True

If it makes you feel any better, that's one of my workstations at work; my home machine only has a GTX 970 in it (so it's pointless to break into my home!).   The big workstation has a 3kW PS and the machine sounds like a swarm of angry bees when it's heavily loaded, so there's an enormous acoustic isolation/thermally transparent box around it to make the room tolerable (barely, so it's in a remote location offsite).  The isolation cabinet is about the size of a coffin.  Also, I don't get to keep it after my current project either (so sad), but there probably will be something 2X better at 1/2 the cost by then.
