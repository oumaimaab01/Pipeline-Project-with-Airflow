I am coming up against a challenge however. In my file, I use a csv list to scrape a website. However, in the bundled version the program cannot find my csv file and fails to launch. One solution I thought of is implementing code to do a computer wide search of files to find a matching file name (i.e. file.csv). Alternatively is there a location I can place the csv folder so that it works. I must be able to go back and change the contents of the csv after the bundle, or change it entirely. You are awesome and I'd greatly appreciate any feedback or strategies to accomplish this goal.",True

@XraytedTimtations,2014-11-16T08:06:49Z,0,"Explain this one: I have the following path for Python 3.4  C:\Python34  I can enter the following into CMD:  path = %path%:C:\Python34  Hit enter, and it takes. I then verify by typing in path and executing to get this:  PATH=C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Oracle\Java\javapath;C :\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;ALZip;C:\Program Files\ATI Technologies\ATI.ACE\Core-Static;C:\Program Files\EST soft\ALZip;C:\Program Files\Nmap:C:\Python34  So now it's there. now I'll type in and execute the following:  python  And I receive:  'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.  I then again type in path and execute to receive this:  PATH=C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Oracle\Java\javapath;C :\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;ALZip;C:\Program Files\ATI Technologies\ATI.ACE\Core-Static;C:\Program Files\EST soft\ALZip;C:\Program Files\Nmap  Python disappears from the end of the list. I did find that I can run this instead:  C:\Python34\python  and it works just fine. However, I as well am having difficulties having the program run after it has been converted to an executable. Even if I have to run it from the command line, that won't be an issue as I have written many batch scripts and it will be a simple 3 lines of:  Set filepath=""Documents and Settings"" Start C:\%filepath%\%username%\Desktop\ExampleFolder\Example.exe exit  That is assuming they have the file on the desktop that has the program within and are using either a link to this batch script or executing it directly.   Sorry that this is so long, but it shows you exactly what is happening. Do you have any insight into this, as well, does anyone else? I have read the comments, sifted through the documentation for python, done many google searches, and nothing explains why the path for Python is removing itself. Please help in any way you can.
