@SomethingRandomChannel,2024-01-15T10:13:58Z,0,"thanks so much for this video series Sentdex, I know I'm late to the game but I noticed that you don't normalize the numbers when you make a prediction request. However, when we trained the model we did normalize before handing over the data to fit. I tried normalizing the data before making a prediction and I got rubbish results, when i took the normalization out it worked fine.   Why is it that we train on normalized numbers but don't prepare our prediction request data in the same way?",True

After retraining the model with a larger image size of 100, I was able to classify images correctly. That said, as he pointed out, this is about 80% accurate, so if misclassified--it doesn't necessarily mean your CNN is wrong--it might just meant you have to tweak your model to increase validation accuracy.

@Kadir85Akin,2020-07-03T20:58:23Z,0,"Unfortunately I couldn't make it work. Perhaps there is an issue in model. I guess, the code in this tutorial misses normalization by dividing 255. We need it because during the training we divided the pixel values by 255. But when I dont divide by 255 (as in this tutorial), ML randomly tells dog or cat. If I divide by 255 for the normalization, in this case the result is always dogs. So, in the video of this tutorial do we see the result correct just by chance? Because according to my experiment, the correct estimation ratio seem less than 30% (if we don't normalize as you did). Could you please check the model with other images, or could you explain why we don't need to normalize before prediction (although we did it during prediction)? Do you get more than 50% accuracy with this code ? What can be the problem for our case ?  I saw that there are other people reporting the same issue, your help in this issue would be great.

That being said, I never did this myself so I have no idea of how simple/complicated it would be but I guess having one instrument track per MIDI file should greatly reduce the complexity in contrast with say 10 instrument tracks.",True

I'm also excited about your recurrent net tutorial, mentioned at the end! Maybe I'm mistaken, but would that be appropriate for equity market data (stocks, in particular)? I've been experimenting a little, but am very very very much still in the learning phase with all of this. That said, I want my programming skills to be more current, and why not see if I can make a few bucks while learning! haha. Thanks for taking the time to share so much great knowledge!",True
