@carlospua1712,2016-07-23T19:17:21Z,0,"Great Tutorial. I'm new on this stuff with python and nltk. now I am working on a project that the main purpose is to try to predicte a best user to assign a ticket based on the descriptions of ticket historical data, and also implement a machine learning app to feed the model every time a ticket is closed (it's suppose closed for the best user to resolve it) . at the beginning I tried to do it with SQL creating a dictionary with the split by noun phrases but with machine learning the idea is to pass a vector space. I would like you to guide me what it would be the stpes that I have to follow to do this project. Initiatlly, I think that I have to tokenize the descriptions of each ticket with the user who closed it and then train and test the data, but to implementing with a machine learning, I don't know how to do it. Maybe I am not on the right direction. I hope you can help me on that. thanks in advance",True
