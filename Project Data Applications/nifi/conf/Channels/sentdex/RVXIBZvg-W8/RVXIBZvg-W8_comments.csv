@jisa4gamers,2019-05-21T01:17:33Z,0,"I'm no Python expert, but I've been using C for a long time and therefore I'm familiar with how much different data types requires space and how fast can they perform.  Speaking from this perspective, I would highly recommend Tuples to be used as arrays with a fixed size. Lists are way easier to handle if you have manipulations and therefore a dynamic size, However put in mind that it comes with a cost of performance and Memory. Why would someone go for a tuple ? Simple enough, to save memory.",True

I have a little practice program I am trying to do. I am trying to create a function that adds 'and' to the  -1 spot of a list any list that is passed to it. I know what I have to do but I do not know how to do it.  With the insert I need to insert 'and' at the element -1 so something like modList.insert(-1,x) Where the x is though I am trying to ADD to whatever is in the -1 spot and add 'and' before it but without the ' '.  This is what I have so far:  def modList(someList):     someList.insert(-1, 'and')     print(someList)  spam = ['Dog','Cat','Bat','Mouse'] modList(spam)  OUTPUT:  ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Bat', 'and', 'Mouse'] Desired OUTPUT:  ['Dog, Cat, Bat, and Mouse']  Any help is much appreciated...",True

@TechLord79,2016-01-03T13:24:43Z,13,"Tuples come from more functional languages and are for example used as arguments or return values without the need to create a full class/object (should there even be objects).And usually tuples are collections that have different types of items (""heterogeneous"") whereas lists are composed of items of the same type (""homogeneous""). There are even programming languages that require lists to always have the same item type. Python doesn't seem to.A line of a CSV file read in as a tuple makes sense or as we have seen sockets use (host, port) pairs. Or like using a tuple for a vector (x, y) because x has no meaning without y and vice-versa, there is an ""intimate"" relationship (same argument could be made for host, port). F# has guidance for this e. g. regarding function parameters.",True
