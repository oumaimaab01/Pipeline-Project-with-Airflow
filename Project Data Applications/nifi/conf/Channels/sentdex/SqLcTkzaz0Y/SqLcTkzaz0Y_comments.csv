@attorneybob,2016-01-31T23:18:13Z,0,"Thanks for your videos. I've watched about 12 of them so far. I'm still trying to figure out (I'm brand new to Python) how to use daily price information along with two minute, five minute, and 10 minute bars (actually more, but if I know those, I can figure out other time frames)",True
@JyotirmoyRoy,2015-12-05T05:33:06Z,0,"Hi, Sentdex, this whole series is amazing. Thank you for doing this.  My question is when in handle_data, we are using ""for stocks in context.stocks"", why do we get a different result compared to ""for stocks in data""? When I was going through the series first, I didn't notice the change, but I was merging this strategy with another, was trying to use ""for stocks in data"" I'm getting a very different result. Could you please shed some light on this?  I also have posted this question in Quantopian forum, you might want to take a look at https://www.quantopian.com/posts/what-is-the-difference-between-context-dot-stocks-and-data-inside-the-handle-data-function. Thanks.",True
