@nsxkkxlnmiyo8722,2023-12-14T21:10:34Z,0,"but so yes, you do need to have the actual hardware with you specially because of the peripheries that you will have access to if and only if you have the computer on your own hands. limitation arise when you plan to use the web, no access to micro sd cards--how will you get the data transfer--no access to an yof the usb drivers--how will you use other peripheries or microcontroers.i think then, if you are stricly only some sort sort of software engineer then you could do fine but if you are an engineer of some sorts--electronics, hardware related stuff--you'd want to have the laptop on your lap",True

@waverider1674,2022-09-17T06:59:27Z,1,My advice from my personal experience with this laptop - Please don't buy it. It is not worth the money. The laptop is a barebone one sold from Sager. It has overheating problem on prolonged use. The battery lifetime is horrible. Once the battery expires it enlarges almost ripping out the touchpad. It is very difficult to get a replacement battery. I contacted the LambdaLabs their support was horrible once the unit is sold. Their advice to me - get a new laptop. For machine learning It is better to build a custom desktop with many cooling accessories available than waste money buying a tensorbook laptop.,True
@jawwadsabir4620,2022-09-09T16:20:55Z,0,"For the laptops Iâ€™m personally done with linux/windows and donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going back. First thing is the crazy heat and fan even with just vscode open with some browser tabs. Other thing is If I am asked to work on some crazy DL project, I would be provided with equal compute power or Id rather rent a cloud if its a freelance work. Macs is the way to go for everyday workflow which i can take it anywhere and use it comfortably like one the airplane.",True

@Zartris,2022-08-20T16:13:27Z,13,"Please, we bought 5 tensorbooks for our research team, and we have never regretted anything more! The computer overheats very quickly when training networks on them an and just opening pycharm makes the fans go crazy. We have send them back is ""defect"" but every new tensorbook we gets have the same problem. If you intend on training networks for longer periods of time, it will heat up and lowering the lifetime of the component as it is a compact devices with minimum airflow capabilities.  I'm not here to argue with people and some might have good experiences with this, but I do want to share our experiences as we have fully regretted our purchase.",True
@cedricdb,2022-08-16T15:00:15Z,0,Why buy from Lambda over buying directly from Razer? Iâ€™d assume Razer is cheaper. And whatâ€™s the deal with Lambda asking $500 extra to include Windows 10 Pro (dual boot) over just Ubuntu?,True

@datasciyinfo5133,2022-07-22T00:54:01Z,4,"Also, I needed to upgrade my laptop anyway, which was 4.5 years old and I paid $700.  A $2000 laptop is something I could have bought anyway for my main recent model laptop.  And now I can train deep learning models on it using PyTorch and Tensorflow GPU libraries.  2x speed increase over the free Google Colab GPU was an unexpected icing on top.  Asus ROG Strix G17 is a very nice laptop for general use.  (I donâ€™t play games, but have watched movies on it).  Jennifer :-D.",True
@datasciyinfo5133,2022-07-22T00:23:48Z,7,"Thanks!  I bought the hard cover book nnfs. Didnâ€™t know about it before.  A month ago I bought Asus ROG Strix G17 2021 model for $2000 (MSRP was $1800 at launch, but availability was always limited).  It has NVIDA RTX 3070 gpu with 8 GB video RAM, 16GB regular RAM, Ryzen 9 cpu, and 1 TB SSD.  It was the sweet spot among all Nvidia gpu laptops I reviewed.  $2000 was my budget.  3080 gpu starts having heat issues that reduce how much performance bump you get.  This one does really well with cooling fans.  I used free Google Colab before, and language model epoch speed is twice as fast on this laptop.  I get frustrated using only Colab all the time.  Data has to be downloaded/uploaded to Colab servers each time I run a notebook, only one notebook can be connected at a time, so all code snippets need to fit in one notebook, and there are frequent outages.  Mounting large dataset to Google Drive really slows down processing, so is not an option for deep learning.  I am so happy I bought a gpu laptop.  I will use it for tweaking and pilot testing, then run the really large models on paid cloud services.  Itâ€™s very convenient having the conda environment set up just the way I want, and Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 and Ubuntu set up the way I like too.  Thank you for your years of teaching online.  I am so glad there are teachers like you in this world, at this time.",True

@lashlarue59,2022-07-21T13:56:20Z,2,When you were testing between this laptop and the 1080 did you run any Tensorflow tests? The reason I ask is the 1080 and M1 does not have any Tensor Cores but the 3080 does so I would expect the 3080 to really shine in that category. Also can we have access to the test suite you used?

There's lots of press around all of the amazing ML asic's. for the 80w allocated to the GPU, using an ML asic would make more sense, obviously that would probably be much harder in something like a razer laptop, designed for GPU space. On the otherhand, I imagine with a different chassis it would be possible to implement.
