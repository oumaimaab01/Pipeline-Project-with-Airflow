@eugenefdscodes,2023-02-15T01:30:54Z,8,"Man I had so many errors come up when I tried to run this! But I fixed them all (as of 2/14/2023). Here‚Äôs how:  The first error was this annoying type error: ‚Äústring indices must be integers‚Äù for the df=web.DataReader(.... line.   It looks like this is an issue with pandas_datareader.data itself. Apparently Yahoo prevents it from scraping stock info correctly as of Dec 2022 so it does not work.   But I fixed it by importing a different module called yfinance. You have to install it by opening up a terminal in your IDE (I use pycharm) and then typing in ‚Äúpip install yfinance‚Äù  Once that‚Äôs installed, you then add ‚Äúimport yfinance as yf‚Äù to the top of your code along with all of the other import statements.   The next step is to add one line right below all the import statements: yf.pdr_override(). This means that whenever you‚Äôre using a function from pandas_datareader, yfinance will swoop in and solve it instead.   Then, you need to change the acronym (not sure what it‚Äôs called) for pandas_datareader.data from ‚Äúweb‚Äù as sentdex wrote to ‚Äúpdr‚Äù everywhere in your code.   Lastly, remove the ‚Äúyahoo,‚Äù argument in the web.DataReader(‚ÄôTSLA‚Äô, ‚Äòyahoo‚Äô, start, end) line. If you don‚Äôt, then it‚Äôll give you this error: ‚ÄúValueError(""time data 'yahoo' does not match format ‚Äò%Y-%m-%d‚Äô‚Äù)‚Äù  If you remove yahoo, it should just have ‚Äú(‚ÄòTSLA‚Äô, ‚Äòstart‚Äô, ‚Äòend‚Äô)‚Äù.
