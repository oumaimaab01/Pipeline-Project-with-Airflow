@louis1001,2018-06-17T22:52:19Z,2,"I'm gonna try to explain the ""this"" thing.  Javascript doesn't really works with classes. Not in the normal sense.  You create objects, and you can have object literals. Written like ""{key: 'value'}"".  But you also have functions that work similar to classes. For example:  function Ball(radius){   this.radius = radius }  Here the function Ball is a constructor, in a sense. You create objects of type Ball, saying 'new Ball(10)'. And when you do, inside the construction there is available the new object with the name of this.  Everything store in 'this' is gonna be the output in the output of the construction.  It works like self in python, yeah. But it's a little more flexible.   Prototype is like the opposite of 'this', by the way. It stores variables and functions that are gonna be shared between the instances of the constructor.  You wouldn't want your Ball to create the same function Move for every instance. Instead, you put Move in the prototype of the constructor. That way it's only declared once, shared between every instance, and adapted to each one depending on the ""this"" that is being used on.  It's probably confusing if you haven't used it, and I don't heal with this poor explanation. But it isn't really that difficult once you have practiced a little.",True
@pafnutiytheartist,2018-06-17T21:01:03Z,0,"Is there any reason why onehot array output for network is better? Why using just one output (<-0.3 move left, >0.7 move right, else stay still for example) is worse? I saw you do this several times and I woder what is the reasoning behind it is.",True

@Lunsterful,2018-06-17T16:10:41Z,0,"The meaning of ""this"" in JavaScript has some annoying gotchas in more complicated applications, (read: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this ) , and with the latest version of JavaScript ES6, it has an additional contextual difference (in arrow functions).  JS is improving massively (the pong code seems to be ES5, it would look very different in ES6).  I suppose for you Python experts, it's like difference between Python 2 and 3?  JavaScript is a very crazy language, but if you adopt ES6 and even better, TypeScript, you might one day love it.",True
@kwea123,2018-06-17T14:28:59Z,0,"Hey according to https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/index.html#layers.dense, if you don't specify the activation function, your model's gonna be linear no matter how many layers you add. I thought you have noticed this in the previous video, but you didn't pay attention to it here. Also I don't quite get the point why the opponent's paddle's position (and its previous) is necessary as input here, adding those will possibly make the training more difficult (longer), even if surely they won't affect the result.",True
@GalHorowitz,2018-06-17T14:20:02Z,0,"The reason the 'this' keyword works in function, is that before the 'class' keyword was introduced you could use function as class declarations.",True
