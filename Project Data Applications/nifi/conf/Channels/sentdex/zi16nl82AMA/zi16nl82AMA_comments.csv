I'm interested in processing a lot of data and doing auto Categorization, tags, and filling relevant param values.   For example, ingesting all of the YouTube comments I've ever made (such as this one) and outputing projects, with refs to original comments.  Then process all of chatgpt history and append to yt results.  Another example is to make a tool for yt creators to process read and respond to comments. Some bug creators get thousands of comments, but most can be grouped as similar, or by tags: question, idea, feedback, help, connect, etc Let me know if you catch my drift and see the value in this. All the best man!",True

It aided me a lot in my previous semester work. However i need some specific help.   I am currently doing a project where i am basically collecting questions that are asked and generating various ""tags"" for each question. These tags allows analyst to understand what the context of the question is.   So far i have thought about using topic modelling algorithm as well as pre processing methods that you have shared in your previous tutorial. What got me confused is how do we get the context of the question.   For example the question ""What is networking"" is different when asked by someone majoring in Computer Science and someone who is in the business field! Any tips?
