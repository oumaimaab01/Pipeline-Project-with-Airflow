@rileyjruse,2014-03-02T21:06:07Z,2,"I'm working on a project involving an accelerometer and PID control.  I was wondering if you could send me some information or make a video on real time graphing of serial data.  I'm a physics major so not really an expert programmer.  But, the problem I'm dealing with is kinda unique.  Basically I'm graphing accelerometer data form an Arduino Uno using an ADXL345 Breakout Triple Axis Accelerometer.  I have a working code for transferring serial data to a text file but I'm having a difficult time using matplotlib to graph my serial data in real time.",True
