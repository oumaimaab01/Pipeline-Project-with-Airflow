If i were not familiar with python i would probably quit already, try to explain why you do what you do and show what you're doing(especially connecting all those things to the breadboard) because skipping crucial parts of the tutorial is like with the Owl meme when you just draw 2 circles and then draw the rest of the owl. Anyway i know it's a series from 2017 soo a lot could change. Cheers.",True

@runelynx,2019-02-20T07:05:54Z,0,"Hi... question. I followed a sample for LED control that imported LED from gpiozero. I then define the LED's pin and turn it on, off, make it blink, etc. When I run that in Thonny on the desktop, the LED works flawlessly. When I run it from the terminal, nothing happens. If I run python in the terminal and singularly enter the same lines from my .py file - it works.  .... why is this happening?  When you execute the python script from terminal it works fine! :(",True

@mementorequiem,2018-03-21T19:03:38Z,3,"I'm puzzled, perhaps someone can help:  a) where do we get the 0,000058 from?  b) why are we dividing and not multiplying?  I was taught at school that:  distance = speed of sound * elapsed time  1) speed of sound at 20*C is 343 m/s -- we want to know the distance in cm, so we have to convert 343 m/s = 34 300 cm/s 2) elapsed time... shouldn't we divide by 2... since sound wave emitted by the sensor makes a round-trip (from sensor - to object - back to sensor)? 3)... I'm clueless. :(",True
