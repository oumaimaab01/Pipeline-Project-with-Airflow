@maxiewawa,2017-08-01T23:30:13Z,0,"0:55 ""...that asks if the method is post...""  Can someone explain this? I've googled everywhere and no one has explained it, it's just something in the code that works but I don't get. As opposed to the method being GET? I don't understand that either. None of the other functions in Flask use method, get or post. Wuh?",True

@joeg816,2017-04-12T21:48:07Z,0,"I love your tutorials and you are a great teacher, but I need to make a small correction...  The ""value ="" param in the form field is not where Python gets the variable name from.  The variable name comes from the ""name"" parameter in the form input field.  You can use the ""value"" field to preset the value if you wanted to pre-fill the field with something.",True
