@Astro-X,2018-04-24T09:01:46Z,0,Wrong? You will never reach 100 because your last number is 100... its supposed to be 101 to get 100 I thought.,True

@trench6118,2016-01-21T03:57:47Z,0,"Can you help me identify whether monte carlo would be a decent approach to solve this problem:I have theÂ performance of a metric per day (down to a 30 minute interval level) which means I can account for weekdays, day of month, etc. It's Jan 20 right now so there are 11 days left in the month. Based on the current actual performance for the month and the historical data from previous months (accounting for the labels I mentioned previously), is there a way to estimate what the end of month performance result will be? Example: Number of interactions and average interaction length. Can I build something to accurately predict the end of month average interaction length knowing I have X number of days left (some of those days being weekends, maybe performance at the end of the month is better, etc depending on historical data, maybe there has been improvement in the latest month which should carry some weight)? Would I use monte carlo to give me a range of potential results?",True
