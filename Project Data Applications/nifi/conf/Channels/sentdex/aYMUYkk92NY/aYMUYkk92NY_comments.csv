@hamedatohamedato521,2018-09-18T22:31:59Z,0,"I have a question for you my friend. I do love to go for a law-abiding drive so I need a speed control. But as we balance the training data we lose the track of how fast we go. The only way, I can think of is to get speed information from the gauge being displayed on the frames. I guess if we want alexnet to be able to detect the speed too we need to have a huge training data, I'm talking about millions of samples so that it predicts when it should reduce the speed especially on turns by scanning that part of the frame that displays the speed gauge. Or is there a way that we detect the speed using image processing and apply it to CNN along with the input frames so in this way we won't need a huge training? I mean is it possible to input multiple data not necessarily from the same sort like images and scalar values (speeds) to a deep model? Or do I have to train 2 different models that I guess in this case the algorithm won't track why on turns we reduce the speed but we keep going forward without reduction because image data are separated.",True

I was thinking HAAR cascades could be used to classify objects but there are many different objects in the game, so making a cascade for each and every one of them would take forever and would not be able to detect at runtime I think.

@frcento,2017-06-01T18:47:29Z,74,"Probably your card had a bad BGA connection. I work with GPU repair, unfortunately I'm from another country and I can't fix for you, but you can try something that is easy to do, and can temporarily fix you GPU.   All you need is remove the cooler, clean the GPU, removing thermal paste, and then you turn on without the heatsink, let it run for 10 seconds, normally from a cold start (ambient temp GPU) it will heat and shutdown the video between 10 to 20 secs (turn off you PC manually on mains switch) Do this process 4, 5 times, leaving some time to the GPU recover ambient temperature before start another cycle.   Explanation why this could work: Thermal expansion of the material (solder joints on BGA and chip substrate) induced by the temperature cycles can restore connection, sometimes temporally. Actually, that is what cause the problem on the solder in the first place also. Some people put the GPU on the oven (aka. Linus Tech Tips Method haha) - dont do this oven thing by the way.   Of course, there is a professional way to do this. The more simple thing is the reflow - that need a least some kind of soldering air station, heated plate, soldering flux and thermocouple probes, and experience, or a BGA station that is more adequate. Reballing is the best option avaliable, but is a little more complicated also, you can type ""GPU reballing"" or ""reflow BGA"" just for know what it is.. =)",True
