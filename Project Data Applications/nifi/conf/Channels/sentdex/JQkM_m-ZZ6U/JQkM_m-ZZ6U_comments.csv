@alexbenfield8690,2020-06-07T03:53:55Z,0,"Hi all,   I thought I might help anyone who was struggling to get the full list of parsed csv data that Harrison obtained. After much fiddling, I found that removing the 'r' before the regex expressions in the re.search code helped me grab the rest of the data. If anyone could elaborate on why exactly Harrison needed to use a raw string, since it appears the use of 'r' was the issue within my search function, then that would be much appreciated!",True

I have a couple of questions... in your function 'Build_Data_Set', how did you select the ""features""? Is there way to select the ""best"" features or in this case you did a random select?  Thanks!",True
@TheMrEhCAN,2016-08-23T20:31:20Z,1,"Hey! First, let me say thanks for these great tutorials!!  Second,  my X[:,1] has NAN in there (if I print it). Hence the .fit() complains about it. Did I miss something in one of the previous sections on how to handle this? As I see from your video, you don't get the error message ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64'). :)   X[:,1] = [ 16.18  13.17  13.75 ...,    nan    nan    nan] Show less",True

@datmesay,2015-01-21T08:27:09Z,0,"Thank you for this great video. Regarding your test/train samples, and the shuffling (and eventually the folding of your data) have you tried the cross validation from scikit ? http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html  Each time I need to train & test my prediction I find it useful to have the kfold validation available.  Furthermore, IMO, you should warn your audience about the linear regression (I mean vs the non linear, pro & cons and eventually compare their ROC).",True
@wchaves1099,2015-01-07T18:51:52Z,0,"Hi Harrison,  First of all, great tutorial videos. Love it.  Question: I intend to apply machine learning to a one minute quote ticker data. However, as you pointed out, collecting and organizing the data is the most hard work to do to accomplish this task. I've done with the prices already, and now I'm wondering what kind of data would be meaningful to a one minute quote ticker? I know this is not exactly what you are trying to teach, but as you are experienced with stocks and forex subjects, it worth ask. ;) All the features you pulled up from Yahoo regarding those stocks I believe are only daily data, right? 2nd Question: If I find something useful, but hourly data, how can I normalize the data with one minute price data I have?  Thanks for those tutorials, I keep always checking my emails waiting for new releases. :)",True
