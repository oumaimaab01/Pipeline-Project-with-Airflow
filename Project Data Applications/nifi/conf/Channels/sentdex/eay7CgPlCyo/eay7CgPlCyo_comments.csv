I have multiple positive images (a bit different with yours), and I saved the positive images as you suggested in the previous video (the number of object, x position, y position, width, and height information after the path directory of the corresponding image). Finally, I saved it in pos.dat file. However, when I  types the exact command like yours in the command prompt, there was nothing in my info folder.  I typed this command in my command prompt:  opencv_createsamples -img pos.dat -bg neg.txt -info info/info.lst -pngoutput info -num 60  I only have 60 negative images as my samples.  Nevertheless, if I used only a single positive image, just like you, I got the info.lst and all the images in my info folder.  here is what I typed in the command prompt:  opencv_createsamples -img rct.png -bg neg.txt -info info/info.lst -pngoutput info -num 60  Please give me your advice.
