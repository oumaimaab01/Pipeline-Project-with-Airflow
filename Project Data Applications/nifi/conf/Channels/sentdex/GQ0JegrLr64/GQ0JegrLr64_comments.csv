@georgelza,2019-11-27T04:16:12Z,0,"Question, re looking this video, 3 yrs ago now, you learned C++, and you leaned Golang? comparing these 2? I've played with both, well done allot more with Python, and self taught Golang, the team around me is switching allot of development over to Golang as we want the speed (Real time transitional processing) and the smaller/more secure micro services/images that can be build for K8S environments. comment ?

@diehardAMD,2018-09-06T05:52:55Z,0,"Agreed with programming language analysis. I'd add that C and C++, even leading into C#, gives a more well rounded experience and diversity as C family interacts with the hardware side. It's a marriage I think. For example, C family goes from the basic Arduino all the way up to the Apple OS applications. Java on hardware for simplicity? Not Arduino or anything that basic and physically diverse.",True

@princeofexcess,2018-05-24T09:20:05Z,0,java is way better and easier to learn then c++. It was made to improve c++ and it lets you learn better programming practices from the get go. C++ has pointers which are hard to learn at beginning. C++ has tons of concepts you shouldnt really use if you are new like friend classes and multiple inheritance. There is way too much stuff you can but shouldn't do in C++. Its great because of its performance but it's ugly on the inside :p  But for the stuff youre doing C++ is probably better especially since you know python already,True

@iloveanime9226,2017-07-14T10:12:14Z,0,"I like Java I thought it was developed for games and it was easier to make apps in it or something. Because I used to play Runescape and Minecraft and later heard about Andriod using it... yeah cause and effect problem. I thought it was a little spin-off from c only used to create games easier and people will still need to use c/c++ to make the program runnable? But I hated c and loved Java. I also learned a bit of c++ as well basics, to be honest, all the programming languages are quite similar to some extends. I also learned c while helping some CS students with their assignments just from my knowledge of Java   But I know I later found out I learned one of the most popular languages and I like it I always use to get errors for forgetting the ; but now with Python, i am always getting error for a random subconsciously placed ;",True

Java was my introduction to programming, and i love making android apps, but i had to learn Python because i hate JAVA for web app and Python just ROCKS for web apps and data analysis.  Sentimental analysis is also a good reason to learn python but unfortunately most government agencies and big companies in my country don't care about public sentiment.  Now I'm bushing up my C# for 3d development so i can take my company in a different direction.  The project would always determine what language you use, be flexible and open minded.",True
