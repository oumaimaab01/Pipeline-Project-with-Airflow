@Sukuna_FF,2022-08-17T23:45:58Z,0,thank you for this wonderful video. i have a question thought. in the part where you limit the blob s movements the self. x and y in the if statements are highlighted by a yellow line. so this code is it only limited to pygame or id have to import something to make it work in vscode,True
@jankipatel118,2020-10-03T14:53:30Z,1,"sir pygame.QUIT is not working, it gives error that QUIT is not define... but the code is running still, i get blob on screen but, can you just give me solution that how to get ride of that error??",True
@isabellez5671,2020-07-10T12:13:41Z,1,"Even if you're my favorite python resource, I think you're missing the point of teaching Objects by diving too deep into the pygame example",True
@aceaspect2431,2020-05-20T20:03:32Z,2,"I can't run it on pycharm, is there a way to fix that?(it instantly closes the pygame window)",True
@eftimiebudescu8736,2020-04-24T08:53:00Z,0,"when you def the Blob class you use capital B and when you draw_environment(blob) is not capital B but b, i did it your way and i also change and used Blob in  draw_environment and it works either way, this confuses me ,  so def draw_environment(Blob)  inherites from class Blob wright?",True
@athilalthaf6222,2018-03-25T06:42:31Z,1,here its showing object takes no parameters  can anyone help me,True
@Lowzenza4,2017-11-11T21:53:57Z,2,i've learned so much python programming for you....I really hope you keep doing this. I like it when you discuss specific modules and how they work. I really wish I could find someone like you who can do the same for BioPython (for those of us that need python to manipulate DNA sequences and large alignment files etc.).,True
@eazye7059,2017-10-10T06:20:23Z,0,Why we didn't create Blob variables explicitly in class Blob?,True

@bespin,2017-06-08T04:33:57Z,0,Is it normal to have variables such as WIDTH and HEIGHT inside a class that are dependent on outside assignment?  What if you were writing the class to it's own file.  It seems like a weird dependency when creating an instance of the class.  Just wondering about best practice and if this is normal or just for the demo.,True
@jiahueichan5914,2017-05-15T15:21:15Z,0,"Hello sir, I've been struggling with Object Oriented Programming for a while now, up until this point, I don't feel like I can go further without understanding this, so I thought I should ask some question that probably seems silly to most here:  what's the difference between class, function and method that you defined? what's the difference between instance and object?  I did spend quite some time reading explanation on stackoverflow but none of the answer seems to explain it at a fundamental level, it's more like ""A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called."" or another answer of that sort, perhaps it's a good explanation but I don't understand a single thing in that sentence, maybe you can provide a more metaphoric explanation? :/  Finally, love your videos, been a little lost in direction after learning intro to python from coursera. Thank you :)",True

@TuxGnome,2016-12-06T00:40:29Z,2,"Hey sentdex, really happy you are taking these OOP videos in real world scenarios not just ""monster X and monster Y"" examples. If I may suggest something, there are some methods from pygame you are using, it would be great if you compare these methods to the ones you are creating, ex: if event.type == pygame.QUIT: what is pygame.QUIT exactly? why is QUIT uppercase, is it the same as the methods we are creating etc.  Overall I really want to congratz you on doing these awesome tutorials, and I really think you are a gem in our Python community. Hoping to see a laracast-like site for our python community from you. This way can at least support you a bit.",True
