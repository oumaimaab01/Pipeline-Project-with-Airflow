It's not a majer issue, but it's enough to slightly annoy anyone who looks at it too long, and it makes me feel like I have a sub-par product. Don't get me wrong though; I'm just a little disappointed at this unnoticeable flaw. I'm sure this is a publishing problem, please fix this for future copies. Besides that completely valid criticism, this is an amazing book; If you weren't sure about it, buy it now; just maybe wait on the physical copies until this is confirmed to be fixed.  Keep it up Sentdex, just remember that quality of product is a little important; thing's don't have to be perfect, but they have to be close if you want to be a success, even more so than you already are.
