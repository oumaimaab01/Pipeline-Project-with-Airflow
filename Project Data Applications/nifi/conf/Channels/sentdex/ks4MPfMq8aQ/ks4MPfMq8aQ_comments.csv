@OZtwo,2021-04-29T20:36:20Z,0,Odd enough I'm starting here because I got a Jetson Nano (4GB B01) and a basic Jetbot and I want to learn more about AI programming in Python. My hopes are to make a robot like the Vector Robot but with a bit more brains that will be able to train itself. I was able to build a basic dumb robot version which has 0 AI but is able to sense when it stops by comparing 2 images using average pixel colors of the image which makes it very fast in processing since this really only takes up like 3 lines of code. Now that I do have my dumb robot I need to move on to the next level and try and understand AI and then of course figure out how I can train the robot so it will be able to train itself. (when it gets stuck it takes 5 images and then trains off that data which takes about 10 minutes). All that is left is to figure out how to merge the new data to the old data and again learn Python. :)  But the main reason I'm here also is that GTA would be the perfect sandbox to run tests.,True

For example, I was thinking about this earlier, and what if you ran the game just at 1 or even half a frame per second, but then for its output options instead of just it instantly reacting and doing something, it has then a 1 or 2 second action-queue it adds to to actually play the game. So, based on one frame, it could 'plan out' the next second of its gameplay instead of just instantly having to react on a frame by frame basis. Would that be reasonable? I think it wouldn't be too hard to implement in the python code if you've already got the method of creating actions and putting those in the game anyway.",True
