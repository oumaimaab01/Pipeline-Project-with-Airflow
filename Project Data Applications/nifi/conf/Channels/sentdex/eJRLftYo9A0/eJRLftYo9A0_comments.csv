@kimbelldify,2019-03-28T11:14:33Z,3,Thank you VERY much for this series. I started learning tkinter recently with the purpose of creating a gui that would read voltage and current levels live and create a visual interface for use on a tft monitor. As you can imagine.. what little hair i have left wound up in a pulled pile on the floor. I had all but given up when I ran across this series. It does exactly what I needed it to do! Thanks again!!,True

@GoncaloFaustino,2017-04-13T14:32:05Z,13,"Hey!  First of all, thanks for the tutorials, I really appreciate them. I'm a fan already! Everything's been working good so far but the 'command = quit (button disagree)' that, for some reason, isn't working for me. I don't know if you address this issue in the next videos but I just wanted to share a possible way to avoid this little problem, if anyone faced the same problem. It can be as simple as: def ShutProgram():         app.destroy() ...  button2=ttk.Button(self, text=""Disagree"", command=ShutProgram)  That worked just fine for me.",True

Package-PackageVersion-OperatingSystemVersion-[Possibly64BitVersion]-PythonVersion  So Pandas-0.15.1-win-amd64-py3.4 means it's Pandas version 0.15.1 for Windows 64 bit, running Python 3.4.
