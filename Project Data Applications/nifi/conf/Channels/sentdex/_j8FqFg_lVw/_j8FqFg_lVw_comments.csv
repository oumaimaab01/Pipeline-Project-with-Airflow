@jasontmorris,2016-01-11T21:31:32Z,0,"+sentdex Thank you for all of your videos and hard work.  I am really enjoying learning about Quantopian and am looking forward to watching your other videos.  Quick question. I am trying to replicate the work that you've done in this video.  When I select ""Build Algorithm"" after entering the fetch_csv with your URL to the sample data, the site hangs and eventually times out.  I don't know if this is because of some unhandled error due to your sample data or what.  I do know that I have written the code EXACTLY as you have it listed.  Perhaps it is because you aren't updating the data daily anymore?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!!",True
