@spinQubit,2017-04-12T05:31:41Z,0,"Just a note watching this in 2017:  If you use -9999 for the outliers, the algorithm doesn't toss them out of the analysis and it skews your results. you end up losing bigly with your strategy.  If you use a value of 0 for the N/A and NaN it returns the #s he found in the video",True
@michaelpower6280,2017-04-08T00:54:03Z,0,"Does this back testing algorithm allow us to invest in more stocks than exist?  Using are test data all but guarantees that we aren't investing in the ""final"" year so to speak, however it also appears that conceivably we could invest in apple at every point it appears in our test set and have a good chance of outperforming the market.  I suppose that it wouldn't really matter since the algorithm doesn't 'know' it's apple but if we could only invest in each stock once, wouldn't it give a more accurate depiction of our performance.",True
@tianzheli2001,2016-03-19T09:04:29Z,0,"Hi, thanks for the tutorial.  I add some code to print out how many 1s and 0s in the stock index, and compare that with the result, I got this:  Stock ones: 559 zeros: 441  Clf ones: 928 zeros: 72  Accuracy: 56.49999999999999  The accuracy is more than 50%, but most ""good  result"" were contributed by guessing ones. So it sounds like the accuracy  is sceptical!!  Maybe I'm wrong!",True
