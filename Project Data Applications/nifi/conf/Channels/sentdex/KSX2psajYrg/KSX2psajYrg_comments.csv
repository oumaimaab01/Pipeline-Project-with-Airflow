@KarfontaAlec,2017-06-01T14:35:19Z,0,A large learning rate will always mean large oscillations in your error because your making large updates to your weights. Though the level of thrashing I am seeing in the charts could just be complexity of the environment. Still you almost always want to have a decaying learning rate. It's going to dramatically speed up the convergence time. If you're using the common ADAM optimizer it is already decaying the learning rate and also adjusting it per parameter to maintain momentum from previous updates.,True

@meunomejaestavaemuso,2017-04-28T04:54:02Z,0,"I just discovered you channel today, pretty impressive given how bodged it was made, the episode in the highway was amazing.  A couple of things I think you could try to minimize the randomness of the data and getting a better AI. 1. use a fixed camera angle, maybe first person to simulate a real driver, or a over the top. The camera shake should interfere with the decision of the AI. 2. get speed data from the game, I know you don't want to mess with it, getting more data and such, but I think this is bare minimum, this way you could avoid the AI stuck just steering, braking and pressing no key. 3. get a way to emulate joy stick buttons, for granularity in the steering, if you go this bodge way you could emulate the controller using  x360ce and maybe sending commands with pipe or win32api.

@abcdefgh1279,2017-04-27T19:46:45Z,0,"Hey, I am thinking of a few reasons why your AI gets stuck at random points in the game: 1. Too many/wrong edges are being recognized as ""the road"" 2. Is the whole pathfinding algorithm is based only on the visual recognition and not the other conditions, like if the car is turned 90 degrees in the viewport? (that may change a lot in the camera movement and further path recognition if the AI decides to move at all) Maybe you could try to split the AI, and have multiple independent or nested ""cells"", or something. One cell would recognize the road in front of the car, second one could calculate the center of ""our"" lane thus predicting where we want to go. Another cell may at the same time estimate the car's current path and compare the two tracks, and then steer the car accordingly to best match the two ""lines""(paths) I may be wrong though :)",True

@windmill1965,2017-04-22T03:11:43Z,77,"I have the impression that the car is overreacting.  When you create training data, you respond to an image. Your response is delayed (human delay) so the keys are logged some time after the image you are responding to. However, this image you responded to is not being used during the creation of the model. The image which is used is the image when the keys are used. It could be that the training data is better if the keys are linked to an image of e.g. 0.2 seconds earlier. A second item could be related to how strong we steer. In real life we tend to steer more in case of low speed and steer less during high speed. I mean the angle of the steering wheel. The model does not seem to be aware of its actual speed. So if it is driving at higher speed than when it was trained it will rotate the steering wheel too far and thus overreact.",True

@ParallaxScene,2017-04-21T21:04:18Z,18,Could it because it isn't rotating the camera. Because when you trained it I assume you kept the camera behind the car. Is there a way to lock it into a chase cam with the mod?,True
@poc7158,2017-04-21T21:01:49Z,13,"Maybe you should try to use an other architechure like VGGnet wich is nearly 20% better in imagnet so it might do better. Also I think you should use learning rate decay because it helps the model to converge and it is broadly accepted that it improve your accuracy I don't know however if it will solver your shaking loss problem. Watching the video we also see that a lot of the time it press ""a"" or ""d"" and do nothing but when you drive the car you rarely press only ""a"" or ""d"" so maybe if you had the same amount of training data for ""a"" and ""d"" as you have for ""w"" and ""s"" it might be why it do nothing.

I mean do you think if the hardware can support both running at the same time ( + the game ) , I suggest using road edge detection , calculating how close the car is to one edge and use that to correct the decision of weather to move left or right ( multiplying the output vector from the model with something like (1,a,b,1,1,1,1,1,1) where a and b are between 1 and 0 ) . The closer the car is to right edge ( distance tends to 0 ) the lower b gets and higher a gets and vis versa. Also do you think the way the camera view is set affects the output results ? I mean when car hits a wall or a barrier the camera floats to the side view. I don't the think the modal is trained to process that view.",True
