@ajitesh764,2019-07-30T10:37:57Z,0,"Didn't really understand the functionality of the program....i mean how the wrapping function around other function works...just understood what is happening, but not 'how'.   For instance...we don't add any argument when we write @add_wrapping  and it works...but when we dont add any arg to addwithstyle it asks for argument....but when we dont include any arg in while defining  ""def addwithstyle():""    and write @addwithstyle  ...error shows up that an arg was passed to addwithsyle even though we dont...so please explain what is happening and why",True

@minoanlight4545,2018-03-15T22:21:46Z,0,"With so much hype about learning to code recently, you would think such videos would have millions of views. But they don't. Hmm...wondering why? Is it because many people give up long before they even get to something such as decorators? However, I see that videos on HTML, JS, CSS, PHP and other web programming languages have significantly more views than videos about Python, Java, C++, C, C#, Ruby...etc. It is like everyone wants to be a web developer.",True
@kevenzhao,2017-11-13T20:40:50Z,0,Fantastic tutorial on decorators! I love the style of your video with the jokes and good examples. Keep up the good work! :),True

@SparxableTunes,2017-09-29T15:45:04Z,3,"Python is definitely a language where you need to find some madness for your method. Meaning...for me, its hard to learn slowly.

@finfan7,2016-11-30T07:53:35Z,11,"Love your tutorials, but this time I don't quite get the use. After watching this I get *how* to use decorators, at least syntactically, but not *why*.   Is your code, as written at 2:53, significantly different in a useful way from  def add_wrapping(item):         return 'a wrapped up box of {}'.format(str(item()))  def new_gpu():     return 'a new Tesla P100 GPU!'  print(add_wrapping(new_gpu()))  Decorators seem like a way to run a function on the result of a function by default but, if it's the default, why not make it part of the function (e.g. adding 'A wrapped up box of"" inside the new_gpu function)  or, if you wanted to maintain modularity so other things could be 'wrapped,' simply call the function directly? (as in the code above)",True

@Mezklador,2016-11-29T23:14:37Z,0,Nice & easy explanation of decorators. Sometimes it gets tricky to understand how to use it. But you teach it perfectly. Thank you!,True
@laszloszoboszlai9578,2016-11-29T23:07:14Z,0,Hi. If i get it right you can use decorators if you need a certain combination of functions and other times in other order or different parts?,True
@kraay89,2016-11-29T18:03:35Z,0,"So then what is the main purpose/functionality of decorators? Is it 'just' a tool to reduce the amount of copy paste work if you have a lot of similar functions that share a lot of code? Therefore, reduce the clutter?",True

@adrianstobbe9748,2016-11-29T16:28:23Z,1,Hello sentdex. Can you explain why the wrapped_inside function is necessary inside the wrapper function? When I try it directly it says str() not callable. But why does it work in the inner function (wrapped_inside)? Is it because functions can only be called in an inner function? Thanks in advance. I find your videos very helpful.,True
@MrIgorbpf,2016-11-29T15:48:33Z,0,"Could u talk about special decorators (@property, @staticmethod and @classmethod)?  I've read many things about them, but I miss some examples and mainly the real purpose of their use. Great video, man!",True
