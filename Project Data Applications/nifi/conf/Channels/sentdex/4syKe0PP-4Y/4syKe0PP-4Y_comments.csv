@shivamkeshri487,2017-10-09T13:19:08Z,0,please tell me that how we install gopigo because i am using this :  sudo curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo | bash  then thrown an error while i am importing and i also tried with:  sudo curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_gopigo3 | bash  but i didn't find the function what ever you use and not similar  as fucntions........   please guide about it..   and thanks for the videos .,True

@xuzhang872,2016-06-06T04:43:46Z,0,is it possible to let the wheel stop when no key is pressed and let the robot to move when the key is hold?,True
@basselsak6111,2015-12-20T16:03:24Z,0,can it work without the GopiGo ?,True
@Flowlance,2015-08-31T19:10:40Z,1,Really good video series! One dumb question though... Is there a way to remove the graphical interface from Tkinter and just run command line? For my robot project i'm not running an X environment as I don't have a screen hooked up to my robot :) I just want it to start listening to key as soon as it is turned on. Doing it using bash seems like the best option to me at the moment,True
@Dr2011rj,2015-08-26T03:03:52Z,0,"Always like your projects,  very interesting topics. From an electronics/engineering perspective and having build and programmed such a car I do have a little experience. The Servo should be enable on init and then left enabled. So that it is always on and tries to resist if any force tries to move it to a position other than what you have set. Or in your code if you really want to keep it off, just wait say 100ms before doing so, such that you are sure the servo is in the right pos.  And the wiggling can/might be from the resistance of the camera yes but it should have stopped wiggling very soon after, the other reason might be that the PI does not clock PWM(controls the actual servo), but I did see that an I2C write is used in the code to change the servo so this might not be the problem.   And the last thing maybe look into PID( Proportional Integral and Derivative) controller, sounds nastier than it actually is. It will automatically smooth out any sudden changes. Example if your servo is at 0 degrees and you change to 180 degrees then it won't just yank it immediately(impulse). It will gradually(with time) change depending on your PID function.Example it will then go on its own 0, 20, 60, 100,140,160,170,180 all over say 1 second then.  Or if that sounds to complicated, just check out Exponential Moving Average(EMA) filter. It has the same effect as the PID and in simple applications i prefer it because it is literally just about 3 lines( 1 variable, function def, and the return value)   Note: I did quickly see a few comments in the previous library about PID but the function that wrote forward with an PID controller and the one without the PID controller looked exactly the same so doubt if they implemented it, unless it is on the other device they are sending i2c commands.",True
@MrIkariaman,2015-08-25T15:53:43Z,1,Why not make a thread for the servo so that you can move the servo independently,True
