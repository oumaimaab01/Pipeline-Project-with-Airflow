I have a few questions, hopefully somebody can help me out:  I do not fully get the reason why you use fig = plt.figure()  in the beginning. What is it good for? You can also create these graphs without it. Until now, I didn't find any video where this is explained. Especially, I do not understand why you use it in connection with plt.subplot2grid() in several videos (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P90mCSsGE1c). You do not refer to the figure anymore in following code ( also fig.subplot2grid() creates an error for me). Why/how is it useful then?  Is there any video where this is explained?
