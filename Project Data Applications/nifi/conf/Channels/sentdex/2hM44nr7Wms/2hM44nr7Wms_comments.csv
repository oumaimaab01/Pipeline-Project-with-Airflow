Well, I will use the simulator not for self-driving but for data acquisition (rgb, depth and segmentation data), so this method actually helps me out a bunch since then I will not have write my own code to read data and to then save it to disk.

@srikanthsrinivas8797,2019-09-07T17:51:49Z,0,I think the save_to_disk method is to save images for training in a different environment later. For example using the images to train a CNN for steering.
