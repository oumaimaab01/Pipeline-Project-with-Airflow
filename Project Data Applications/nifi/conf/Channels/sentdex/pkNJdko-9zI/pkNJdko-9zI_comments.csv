@nathanwine7528,2015-07-04T13:24:03Z,0,"I have a quick general python question. Is there a reason that people often import a whole package and then reference something specific in that package like you do with DataFrame here? My guess is performance but I'm not really sure how it works.. Is the specific object import acting as a filter on the package? Thanks for all your effort, so much quality content on your site.",True

@sandlermike874,2014-11-05T18:48:43Z,0,"Thanks a lot. Now it works correctly. In fact everything became better after following your advice by adjusting the file's name ""pandas"". This is the result that I had:       22   iphone      black         buy 0  44  samsung    gray     not buy 1  30     sony       black    not buy 2  17  samsung   golden        buy 3  35   iphone       black         buy 4  23   iphone      black          buy  The only one two differences between this result and my original data is first that the original data do not have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (left hand). I thing I have to consider the ""age"" column as a type to display that data. Second, half of the data is missed.   Now my mission is to find how to get all the result of the dataset, and to discover the code that allows me to determine the class that I want to predict which is here (buy/ not buy) where I wish it is also mentioned in pandas' tutorial.  I will be very happy for any further advice. Thanks again ",True
