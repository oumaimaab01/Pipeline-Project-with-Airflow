@NamacilHDx,2017-01-02T21:33:30Z,0,"Hey awesome video, but in the understanding of how to make nerual networks im missing one thing so the neural network is going to you training stuff and resiving a right or false when its outputting something so how does it change then on the right of false things ? i feel like thats the thing i just need to know before i can start testing on my own but i dunno mabey i just didnt got it yet or nobody explaned it .... so what does happen if my neural network gets a wrong ???",True

@5zazen,2016-07-19T04:27:30Z,1,"This was an interesting presentation.  Neural networks are likely not as fragile as biological neural networks.  Initial learning is due to chemical synaptic changes and over time dendritic changes and actual new wiring is put down. Problems can be many due to dopamine/catecholamine excess/deficiencies, and learning takes time to consolidate during sleep which is required largely due to overload, or inhibition, after a person has been awake for a day.  Sleep allows information processing.  Also, there are many different types of learning involving different procedures, brain areas, due to information type and body involvement, eg, declarative vs procedural.  With computers, AI, these inhibitions are zero.  No sleep, no synapses, just electricity and 0 and 1.  As Google showed with Go, associations can be made.  This combined with brute force speed of many cpus is amazing.  Think Skynet.  Its coming.",True
