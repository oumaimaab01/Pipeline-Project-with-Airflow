@Thoracius,2017-07-18T16:13:46Z,0,Hey thanks for this series and getting me into Quantopian.  Is there anything like this for cryptocurrencies?,True
@mpsyp,2017-03-01T04:40:20Z,0,"Wow -- I was super excited about this entire series.  Watched the entire thing today and then jumped in to Quantopian only to find that a significant portion of this code is now obsolete, with the refactoring and introduction of Quantopian 2.  For starters, I am completely lost when it comes to working with the dataframes coming out of the pipeline, now that the ""universe"" concept is obsolete.  The pandas documentation has been very little help.  I've been banging my head against this concept and now actually have a headache.  Any plans on updating your awesome tutorials for Quantopian 2?  Would really love that.",True
@andyvisser7681,2017-01-22T19:00:41Z,0,"I am looking for a little tutorial, or some help, on using zipline locally. I've got Anaconda2 (32-bit) with Python 2.7 . I believe zipline has installed successfully but now I'm stuck. Aparently you have to use something like :  algo_obj=TradingAlgorithm(initialize=initialize, handle_data=handle_data) perf_manual = algo_obj.run(data)  I try this and it says that ""data"" is not defined. I'm trying to reproduce the error as I type this an instead I'm getting :  runfile('C:/Users/Andy/Google Drive/ML/zipline_test.py', wdir='C:/Users/Andy/Google Drive/ML') Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> NameError: name 'runfile' is not defined >>>   Any help would be much appreciated, I'd even be willing to pay lol. The reason for doing it locally and not on Quantopian is because I'm having memory issues while training the ML model on Quantopian so figured I'd best do it all locally. If there was a way to train the model locally and import it into Quantopian I'd be game for that but I don't think they allow this.  Please keep in mind I'm still somewhat new to Python, though I have went through the first 20 videos of your Python for Finance playlist. Thanks again, looking forward to your reply.",True
@willhatch7721,2016-08-04T04:06:56Z,0,Why would you buy stocks based on cash before selling stocks and not the other way around?,True
@Karzacan,2016-07-19T13:13:38Z,1,"Hey man great series, but where is the next tutorial?",True
@chrisherrick2397,2016-03-24T15:45:54Z,0,"To assume a stock not in the currently selected universe is simply underperforming seems naive, but is there any way to examine the real-time price on the current portfolio without cutting into the universe selection? Perhaps running a separate daily script first which simply looks at the current portfolio to determine first what to sell, then running a separate script which loads the current universe with what to purchase?",True
@yaschaffel,2016-03-20T06:26:47Z,2,Can you show how to reference quandl and other datasets with the pipeline?,True
@adamfatyga7977,2016-03-18T18:34:16Z,2,"238/13 = ~18%/year. Not so great, but good at start :)",True
@gaslight0513,2016-03-05T14:52:49Z,0,"I am glad you are revisiting Quantopian Harrison! For anybody else watching, Quantopian has a lecture series if you want more stuff along the same lines as this: https://www.quantopian.com/lectures",True
