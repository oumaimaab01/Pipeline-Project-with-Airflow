@odagora,2015-01-15T15:13:29Z,0,"Hi In fact I have the same problem with the concat operation. I´ve checked all code lines but the error appears: AttributeError: 'TimeSeries' object has no attribute '_data'. I´m running it with python v2.7. I wonder if the concat function or pandas package has been modified for Python v3. Is there a ""best way"" to switch between Python versions in the same windows machine installed simultaneusly?",True
