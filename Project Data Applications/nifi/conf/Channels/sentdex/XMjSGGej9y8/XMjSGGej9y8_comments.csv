@bobwrotenstien315,2017-08-05T22:03:13Z,2,"Unfortunate confusion caused by the words join and merge.   Because when you think of a sql  join, in pandas that is a merge.  From the docs: pandas provides a single function, merge, as the entry point for all standard database join operations between DataFrame objects:  join just appears to be a special case of merge: The related DataFrame.join method, uses merge internally for the index-on-index (by default) and column(s)-on-index join. If you are joining on index only, you may wish to use DataFrame.join to save yourself some typing.",True

I am trying to learn Pandas so I can move away from Excel, which is great, but it can't handle the same volume of data as Python.  May I ask a question?

@lachlanmcleod5294,2016-10-11T01:26:25Z,0,"What about if you want to merge multiple data sets at once (not just two)? For example, you have 15 data sets. Each data set records daily data for a specific month (January data set, February data set etc.).

For instance, all monthly data sets record daily temperature, but one also records daily ice-cream price and another also records daily gasoline price (but not all record these values). You want to join/merge all 15 data sets so that the first column is the date (running through the months in order) and all similar columns link up (like temperature) and all specific columns (that only exist for some data sets) form new columns where only data exists for the monthly data set that it was recorded in?
