@yahelck7959,2018-08-28T10:17:33Z,1,"I think most Python developers miss the point of classes and OOP in general. Classes are like a blue print for creating objects with the same structure but different values, or basically to create your own custom data type. Modules are just a way to group methods together. Using a class to create a calculator object kinda defeats the purpose of a class as you can't (and don't need to) create  more than one instance of it.  An example of a class could be a Neural Network, which you can create multiple instances (models) of, that all share the same structure (layers, fit function, feed forward function, etc.). I'm pretty sure you can't achieve the same goal with Python modules.",True
