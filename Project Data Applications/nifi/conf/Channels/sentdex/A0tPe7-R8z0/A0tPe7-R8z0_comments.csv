@codetestdummy,2023-11-12T07:56:39Z,0,"Is it best (not sure if unavoidable) to consider each servo independently? Looking at the ""tippy-toe"" solution which the model arrived at, we can imagine that it would be very difficult for an actual dog to achieve or maintain that kind of posture (completely understand how local reward valley caused this). We know that in real life both joints on each leg would necessarily move in some kind of biomechanical proportion. I also image that what a real dog's brain is trying to do is imagine ""where"" it wants to put its paw (for balance or some impulse), and the motor cortex figures out the IK subconsciously, rather than thinking of ""how much"" to move it's leg muscles. But since the goal is just a forward gait, is it possible to have a reward function or constraint on the servo solution that follows the ""natural"" movement of the leg? I.e. (edit:) the next movement is a feasible IK solution based on current posture of the leg?",True

@BenjaminScottfromFrance,2022-12-14T18:00:42Z,0,"I'm loving these videos! A few months ago I had an idea of doing exactly what you are doing: running a simulation of an existing robots to try and teach it to walk through reinforcement learning rather than doing it with a real robot.  It's impressive to see how far you're getting. My knowledge about AI, machine learning and, frankly, programming are not even close to yours!  When I thought of the idea I thought of doing it in different steps, for example: - Use IMU and the first task is for the robot to stand up and stay horizontal; - Walk and, still using the IMU, staying as horizontal as possible;  Is is possible to start training a model to do something specific to start with, and then train it to evolve more complex behaviours, like the examples I gave above?  Thanks, and keep up the good work!",True
@sdfgeoff,2022-11-05T12:58:02Z,0,"I've been playing with a similar problem - getting a (sprawling rather than mammalian) type quadrupedal robot to walk using RL. Your videos gave me some great ideas, so big thanks for uploading. One very simple change that gave a big gain was to use the centroid of feet position as the ""robot position"" rather than the center of mass or body coordinates. This avoids the problem of the robot making big initial gains simply by ""leaning"" forwards - and avoids the tendency to end up with hunched forward poses such as the one seen at 16:29 18:17 etc.",True

@mr.witter4543,2022-04-27T00:41:26Z,1,"This is awesome! I also have a Petoi Bittle and I'm planning to start practice reinforcement learning on it as well so these videos are a life-saver. Right now I'm using ROS with a raspi mounted on mine for teleoperation and other cool features but I'd like to train it to make sense of it's surroundings and eventually just act on it's own (for now walking and flipping would be a start).   I see a couple of comments about calculating energy usage and how you could do it on Bittle. One thing that comes to mind is to simulate the current draw from the battery to each of the motors-basically simulate the battery on the robot as well. So for example, if motor 8 moves by 0.2, the battery discharges 0.5%. These are made up numbers as I didn't look into the exact draw of the servo motors.  The second change you could make which would benefit the simulated battery is to have a delayed reward, so instead of getting a reward after each action, you get a reward after either making it a certain distance or fully depleting the battery, and this would reset the simulation. This would encourage Bittle to not only move in a certain direction, but to also conserve energy with movements. This also alleviates your worry of over constraining the robot, and since you have the resources for training it should work just as well with the Proximal Policy.",True

@rlew12,2022-01-01T23:38:28Z,2,"Have you considered creating an energy usage model for the biddle that calculates the center-of-mass and moment-of-inertia of the body and each joint. You could get a rough calculation of the energy usage by looking at the acceleration of the joints and even have a more natural penalty for jumpy movements since there'd be a higher energy usage for moving in the upwards Z direction which you wouldn't get back in the downwards motion.  This would also punish jittery movements since it would punish rapid back and forth acceleration. I know this would be pretty involved to make but might give you more realistic constraints than ""no side to side sway"", ""no roll"", ""no bobbing up and down"" etc. It might even translate into a more natural running gait where you might want something more like a leap in between steps.

@Ihsees91,2022-01-01T19:41:29Z,3,"Cool video! Good mix between information and showcasing your models.  Didn't know about discrete delta PPO yet, this alone was worth subscribing to you in the past.  Regarding the stiff upper legs: maybe that has something to do with move_punish_div? Having no movement in those joints will punish the agents less after all.  When I had to deal with jittering I tried limiting the overall ""joint-movement sum"" per step. If an agent requested more than the allowed value, I scaled the movement of every joint linearly. This works because jittering takes a longer ""path"" to get to the same target position, thus forcing the agent to reduce jitter. I've had decent results with this method (albeit on a different continuous-control problem - and not a walker)  Of course this will give you another hyper-parameter to tune. Maybe do the same calculations on an already working model, and see what kind of value is needed for a stable gait?",True

@Stinosko,2022-01-01T11:18:59Z,3,"I do wonder if it would be possible to predict the position of the main body.   For a position of a object in 3d you need 3 parameters: a center point position of the center of the main body, and two vectors with force 1 that can make a 3D plane that the main body is currently at. (A vector from the center to the front like 1,0,0 and a vector 90° from the center for example the vector up 0,0,1) Those result in 9 values the robot has to keep track off  in order to know it's his 3d position of the main body, and only 6 values for stabality.   Than you can make observations with the current model where you try to predict the position of the main body based on the movement the dog is gonna make. So he learns and predict his behaviour in 3D and maybe can use those prediction in future model?   Than you can try to make a model that minimise the wobbling in 3D plane of the main body, and keeping the walking direction forward.   In a project of the university where i had to calculate a 3d plane from point I used sympy library. Maybe you can use it as well although if i remember correctly it was fairly slow 😊",True
