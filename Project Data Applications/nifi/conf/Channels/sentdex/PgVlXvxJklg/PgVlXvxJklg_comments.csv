@vahabarmenian5845,2020-01-24T17:32:43Z,3,"hi, one big mistake i see is that you are comparing average outcome of next 20-30 days to the change of price from 30th day of pattern to the first day to say if that was a rise or fall you should compare the average outcome of next 20-30 days to 0 in order to know if it was a rise prediction or not",True

@NeoKailthas,2017-05-14T23:42:40Z,0,thanks for the videos. now how do you save the results to an external file and start feeding it new data and have it make predictions based on the saved patterns? or did I completely miss the point of this program?  Thanks,True
@dagharr2,2016-08-24T23:19:59Z,2,"On the whole, I enjoyed this series.  That said, your code is *very* hard to follow (and therefore the logic of the whole enterprise) and would benefit from: 1) Using abstractions that the languages provides (at least some well-defined functions would be nice so you're not tossing global state around and mixing plotting with predicting, etc 2) Stop using magic numbers. p1,p2,p3,toWhat+31,-1.000. I realize they're necessary for the computation, but only insofar as you have made them so. Take advantage of range-based iteration and mapping datastructures (did I see a single dict() or namedtuple()? 3) Perhaps you could describe, at a high-level what you are going to do before you start writing code (ie introduce each video with a diagram or something?)  I might be speaking too soon, having not finished the series...but a question comes to mind: What are we 'learning' here? I thought the more interesting variables to find optimal combinations for were going to be window_size and similarity_percentage. It seems we are ingesting a moving window on the dataset and, *GIVEN* fixed values for those two variables, trying to decide which window (of fixed size) has the most historical matches. That is something, but it seems the interesting learning was going to happen elsewhere.  Anyways, thanks a lot. Really appreciate your effort.",True
@hhhez,2016-07-03T22:49:17Z,1,why do they have different accuracy. Aren't they the same algorithm?,True
@radixvinni,2015-07-04T19:19:24Z,0,"7:20 Stop, stop. Why do you compare last movement in a pattern with real movement after it? Maybe you should better compare realMovement with 0 (whether direction of it matches with predicted direction) or with predictedAvgOutcome.",True
@antoniozeus4,2014-02-02T19:28:00Z,0,would be nice to see how you ran those other scripts :) appreciate the videos. Im a big newb so that's why the baby steps really help. thank you,True
