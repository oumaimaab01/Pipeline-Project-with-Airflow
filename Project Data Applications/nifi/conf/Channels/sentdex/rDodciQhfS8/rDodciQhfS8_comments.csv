Here they gave us set of image urls and labels. they gave us train,test and validation sets also. i want to develop a model so that for every url in test set i must predict a label for it. so for this i  want to download some images from train set (actually they are 19000+) and train them and cross validate them.  But here is the issue, unlike in dog/cat problem this is multi class classification model. so how can i give labels to images that i downloaded and how to cross validate. some ppl are saying we have to change the image to numpy array and some are saying not required.please guide me sir.
