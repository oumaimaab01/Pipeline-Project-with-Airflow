@TechLord79,2019-01-06T16:58:35Z,1,"I see a lack of Windows API GUI programming knowledge :D That funky ampersand stuff (&) is not a shortcut (or accelerator as Microsoft would call it - like CTRL+Q) but a quick menu access key to navigate menus using ALT via the keyboard. I don't know about other platforms and where it really came from originally but we already had that in DOS windowed applications like edit.com (or was it edit.exe) back in the days ... So there is absolutely no reason why this shouldn't work on Windows and it actually does quite fine with wxPython 4 on Python x64 3.6.6.  From MSDN: Menu Access Keys The standard keyboard interface for menus can be enhanced by adding access keys (mnemonics) to menu items. An access key is an underlined letter in the text of a menu item. When a menu is active, the user can select a menu item by pressing the key that corresponds to the item's underlined letter. The user makes the menu bar active by pressing the ALT key to highlight the first item on the menu bar. A menu is active when it is displayed. To create an access key for a menu item, precede any character in the item's text string with an ampersand. For example, the text string ""&Move"" causes the system to underline the letter ""M"".",True

@madhusudhanan9278,2016-12-16T09:31:44Z,1,"Hi sentdex. I love ur vids. I have a query in this video. When we click the file menu, we get different options such as 'new', ' open', 'save', 'exit' etc.  But we also have the recent button(the one with the black trianguar arrrow pointing towards right) inside the menu. So when we hover the mouse on it shows another menu sideways. So is there any separate command for that or .... how do we do it. Like I dont want to put recent button, but i want to put another button inside a button according to my program needs.   Please reply Thank You",True

@michaelcooper5988,2015-11-01T19:42:19Z,1,"Do you have a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the wx calendar control.  I am struggling with this one.  I have 3.4 Pyrhon - part of my frustration is versions I think.   I have Phoenix wx.  Can't seem to locate calendarCtrl in my import routines.  Is these a YouTube that can help?  I like your work and process.  You make it easy to follow except for a few things you skip over like when you use ""e"" in a def. Quit(self,e):  What is the ""e"" and what does it do or not do.   And *args, **kwargs.  I spend way too much time trying to gain an understanding of these items which I see in a lot of code.",True
