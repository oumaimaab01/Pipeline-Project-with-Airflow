I started the interest in the topic by learning about AlphaStar and after some research I ended trying to create some bots in the same way you do. Then I realized that I can do something slight different, an idea that I had since Starcraft I, a bot that is meant to assist the player instead of actually playing the game by itself. For example the bot can take care of micro while the player can do the micro. This is what I am working on right now and it works quite well (when simulation is in real time). However I am thinking of several ways in which the user can interact with the assistant bot. Maybe you can do some tutorials... Once again, great work!",True
