@0Ninja0Dude0,2022-10-17T07:30:12Z,0,I've been looking into installing a fairly decent sbc that I can run windows on. I feel like having an actual car stereo is about as lame as it gets. I have this dream of being able to tune your cars turbo from a capacitive touch screen while simultaneously displaying 3 cameras and also running Google maps and Pandora from your phones network. Might as well have a couple extra displays mounted on the back of the front seats so your passengers can play some retro emulators while you drive across the state,True

@rockytoptech1308,2021-09-24T09:10:18Z,0,"Man I've been thinking about putting a Raspberry Pi or maybe the NVIDIA Jetson in my side by side... Great job man...looks good! I'd use mounts though instead of Velcro and stuff...I mean unless you drive like me ya should be fine but lol I am going to use mounts.   Oh lastly I wouldn't wire the device to the overhead light or an accessory power supply as they're not meant to be hot (12v+) constantly, the switch would be relatively safe but I wouldn't trust 12v+ coming off of any switch constantly. Personally I'm going to use an online 10a fuse and switch and relay to be safe and secure :-)  Also, I absolutely love your cheap mindset....I'm the same. I considered actually just putting in an old lappy running Ubuntu but that's kinda bulky.",True
