@joshuasmith5782,2020-08-11T04:32:15Z,0,Consider implementing Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning. Seeing you val-loss patterns it seems you are not generalizing well. GAIL works very well for imitating human behavior especially in sample constrained cases.,True
@aashaysharma5734,2020-06-25T17:01:55Z,0,will running a SVD or a PCA and getting that variance explained of the training data you use effect the efficiency of model ?? Like won't it be better if we get that approximately what proportion of the image or the data explains the most part of the analysis and using this we can achieve similar or better results using a refactored data ?? Just a thought pls correct me if I am wrong...,True

@hanswoast7,2018-09-23T16:28:44Z,7,Awesome. I am happy Charles is back :)  You could try to detect the speed via minimap movement of the past second and then use it to determine the amount of steering. I guess this will at least look entertaining^^,True

@cerpokas,2018-09-23T06:09:32Z,1,"Hey I was looking how AlphaGo was done and they were including previous boards from the past as different sets of features and some other features ending up with 19 features. Right now I understand you input RGB as 3 features. Maybe you could merge frames from past like 5 previous frames and end up with 6 * 3, 18 features.
