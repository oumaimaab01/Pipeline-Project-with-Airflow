@niclaswustenbecker8902,2018-08-19T00:07:31Z,119,"Great tutorial, but the way you load the data is not very memory efficient and this will cause problems with large datasets. First the training_data list is written into RAM and afterwards the same amount of memory is reserved when converting into a numpy array. So this approach is only good for datasets < RAM size/2.   Another option would be to create the numpy array at the beginning using np.empty and then write the data as entries into the array. This way the dataset can be as large as your RAM.  If the dataset is larger than the RAM size it is suggested to use a generator that loads and yields the data during training. This way your dataset can be as large as your SSD, but training speed is most likely limited by the read speed of the drive.   Just something I had to deal with during my thesis in the last couple of months. Maybe you could make a tutorial on the generator one, not a lot of people know about this.  Anyways, keep up the good work!",True
