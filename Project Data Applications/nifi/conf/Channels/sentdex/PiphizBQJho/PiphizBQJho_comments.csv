@dolodestinations7628,2023-12-29T05:17:07Z,0,i can thwart the username and insert into database. but when i try to select using the same username it says there are no users. even though it is there. so it wont show that there is a matching user. please advise.,True
@lukemoon4466,2021-09-13T18:14:49Z,0,"If you are getting 'not all arguments converted during string formatting'..............this is likely down to not including a trailing comma when feeding in instances of 'thwart()' to the tuple. Even if only one value is fed in (in this case 'thwart(username)') you need to use a trailing comma in the tuple that encases the 'thwart' calls...............note the comma comes immediately after the parentheses of 'thwart'.        x = c.execute(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = (%s)"",                           (thwart(username),))""",True

I had a problem getting to run the x = c.execute part from you script, I'm assuming it's because of different version of a module. I'm posting it here so if any body runs into the same problem can use this code.   Problem: x = c.execute(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username IN (%s)"",(thwart(username)))  Fix: x = c.execute(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username IN (%s)"",[(thwart(username))])",True
