@AnselmeMucunguzi,2017-01-09T03:40:16Z,0,"I have a question: toward the end of the video, you say that a perfect match would have 576 because each image has 64 pixels, and there are 9 versions for each image. In the example, the 3 that you drew has 427 out of 576. Here is my confusion: if a number is, say, 3, its pixels won't only match with the versions of 3. The white pixels in an image with 3 can still match with white pixels in an image with, say, 1. So, if my reasoning is correct, the maximum number of matching pixels could be well above 576. Please explain me. I like your videos!",True

@limproviseur,2014-08-12T21:58:59Z,3,"Hi! Your videos are awesome. I have a problem though with the code in this video. I am using Python 2.7.8, 64-bit. The problem I'm getting is that it's only using 1 when I use an image drawn by me on paint (8x8pix), but it would recognize an image from the file you have on your web page.
