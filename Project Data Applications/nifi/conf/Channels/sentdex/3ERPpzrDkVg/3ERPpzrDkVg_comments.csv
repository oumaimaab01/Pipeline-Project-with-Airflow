@deojeetsarkar2006,2020-01-18T12:04:25Z,1,"Why am I getting only 2 clusters as 222, (3,10,10) and not 111,555,31010. Is my machine broken? How can I learn now?",True

@VascoCC95,2019-12-05T18:27:26Z,2,"""A pain in your... Computer!"" ahaha BTW that blue dot ""outlier"" on the 3D graph is because the axes are scaled 1:2:2 so one of the axis has double the value for the same distance in other axes, that's why it looks closer to other centroid",True

@stevendye249,2018-07-09T14:21:01Z,0,"So my code can calculate the locations of the clusters, and can create the 3d space, but all of the data points are located on the x_1 x_2 plane. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?",True

I'm doing machine learning in my geomatics course now, specifically looking at classification and object oriented classification, so this is super helpful.",True
@kobaltauge,2017-09-17T09:15:37Z,1,Hi @sentdex Thank you very much for this series. I'm learning a lot. Hopefully one day I can help you to translate this or remake it in German if you are interested. One question. What are you using to draw on screen? Do you have a grafic tablet and stylus connect to your computer or are your screencasting from a tablet?,True
@bellasun3820,2017-07-03T06:40:51Z,2,"hello: thx for the video firstly. but I'm very confused about the meaning of ""x,_"", could you help me to answer its meaning? or it means random data in more than I dimension (x axis), and we don't know how many dimensions now, so we just set as x,_ ?",True

@7justfun,2017-02-11T14:57:22Z,0,"so if I had to make an aglometric hierarchical clustering of say 200K sentences, same thing applies with bow vector/data points before applying kmeans/meanshift?",True
@abhishekhar612,2016-09-02T17:18:38Z,0,"very informative !!  I have a doubt in the choice of value for the radius of the bandwidth. What will be the value of the radius, here it covers about 3 feature points initially but that can vary isn't it?",True
@manishadwani386,2016-07-01T06:59:52Z,4,hey sentdex can you please make more advanced tutorial for Django not like blog one  but like an working website and app with rest framework and json anything but not a blog and please include some advance topics like extracting complex data and a user analysiser   actually I couldn't find any tutorial like I'm looking for so I'm requesting you to please make it   help Django developers :(,True
@Grepoan,2016-06-30T20:41:42Z,1,"This has been and excellent coverage of machine learning -- especially classification and clustering.  Thank you for your work.  I *think* that I heard you say you would be covering deep learning in future episodes.  I would just like to confirm this so that I can get my hopes up.  What other material will you cover?  (e.g. Random Forests, genetic algorithms, neural nets, etc)  Thank you!",True
@murtazaroondiwala1611,2016-06-30T19:43:39Z,6,hey +sentdex great tutorials!! Just wondering if you are going to cover neural networks and deep learning.,True
