@chrisherrick2397,2016-03-24T13:38:20Z,0,A note about the last code change you made: prior to the change your buy and short quantities were asymmetric with the short quantity applying leverage and the buy quantity not applying leverage; this asymmetry could have contributed to the massive losses suffered by the algorithm.,True

Could you add a video on how to use zipline in the quantopian notebook environment, including how to use historical fundamental data for machine learning. A video on how to use Talib would also be interesting. Thanks again!",True
@fernandog8776,2015-10-13T01:04:19Z,0,"Thanks for this series, I  have always wanted to program my strategies in python, but just thinking about downloading the data and backtest the strategy hold me back. The series was very useful and I am starting to consider using machine learning in my strategies. I am even considering subscribing for the sentiment API.  Best Regards",True
