@nikunjgupta23,2020-07-13T06:29:53Z,0,"Shouldn't dilation be done after erosion? something along these lines -  dilation = cv2.dilate(erosion, kernel, iterations = 1) In cv2 documentation, it is mentioned that usually erosion is followed by dilation. That makes sense as well since in erosion you are reducing white content in the image. So, you HAVE to restore it. That's why we do dilation.",True

@masoudghodrati3770,2019-09-16T07:06:28Z,0,"great video, thanks! but honestly, why people in tech/science/eng tend to define things more complex than simple? shouldn't it be the opposite?
