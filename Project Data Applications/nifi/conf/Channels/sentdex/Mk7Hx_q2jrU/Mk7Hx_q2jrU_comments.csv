@edgarlarios1451,2020-07-07T18:51:47Z,1,"if you are getting the -f unknown error use this instead mpiexec --hostfile  machinefile -n 1 hostname this worked for me. if this does not work then you might have to trace back you're steps to make sure everything is installed right.",True
@xthrax,2019-05-08T03:55:02Z,0,"@sentdex I'm having trouble using the which function. Every time I use it (for: ""which mpiexec"") the terminal returns nothing, further more I tried cd /home/rpimpi/mpich3-install/bin/mpiexec (to see what would happen) and it returned ""Not a directory"" what's going on?   P.S. I logged out several times and it has done nothing, also I am using a raspberry pi 3 b+(I doubt that this would change the outcome you're getting too much though), further more the which function does not seem to return anything at all when I use it.   Really could use some help thanks.",True
@davidciocoiu3831,2019-04-24T00:22:29Z,0,"great tutorial, but just an FYI for those of you trying this on PI 3 b+ ( specifically b+ model ) you will need a fan for your pi though it may not be mandatory it's useful in avoiding frying your CPU, also it keeps the system nice and cool ( which as with any computer it's mandatory). Also while this will work with Odroid, you'll need a full blown fan ( like the type that comes with CPU) since the heat spreaders aren't enough.",True

@jcasaubon,2014-11-23T03:57:34Z,1,"Just an fyi.. I got the weird characters and missing ""~"" with my keyboard. It was that my keyboard was setup as a UK keyboard instead of US 104 keys. This can be changed in the config screen of the raspberry pi. This command should help ""sudo raspi-config"". Great vids Thanks!",True
@luketreloar5145,2014-05-11T14:39:54Z,1,"Sentdex:  sorry to be a pain, but have tried this a few times in different ways and still unable to get it to work.  after adding path to profile, I can't CD in to it. says ""no such file or directory"".  I can CD in to /home/rpimpi/mpich3-install but not the /bin.  when I LS on the /mpich3-install directory, it is empty.  Should there be something in there? have I missed something?  Thanks a million!!!",True
@ltreloar,2014-05-01T17:24:50Z,2,"hey.  feel really dumb.  when I add PATH =""$PATH:/home/rpimpi/mpich3-install/bin"" to profile, I still can't CD in to it.  any ideas?",True
