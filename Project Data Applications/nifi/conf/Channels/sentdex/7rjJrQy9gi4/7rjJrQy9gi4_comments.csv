@jamiehosmer1481,2020-10-18T04:57:07Z,0,"6 years later, but for anyone curious, the issue at 8:25 with the missing ' ' around the string 77 is because the print() function is used.  The reason the '55' appeared earlier with apostrophes/single-quotes is because the line was issued simply as intMe, instead of print(intMe).  Hope this helps someone!  Keep up the great work Harrison!!",True

@EvdeKsp,2015-01-09T19:17:21Z,0,"Hi, is there a built in function to make a new list (you might not understand me so let me explain), i want to make a data storage application where i can let people give names, ages, jobs,... and then later when they go to the program and type in the name all the extra info appears. the problem is that dictionaries only have 1 value per key so i figured to use a list as my key. but now for every person adding a name i need a new list or a list in my list and i dont know what sort of function i should give to my ""Store Data"" button in my program.(im using Tkinter). so do you know what i should do and after this i also need a system that names those list and i dont know how to make this. I understand if you cant answer all my questions but just giving me a link to the right information is good enough.",True
