@lucascerro8189,2020-05-09T20:29:01Z,1,"Just to be clear:  is your objective with chunking and chinking in these videos specifically to isolate the names and nouns that may be the ""subjects"" of the sentences?  In other words: using chunking, tagging and regex you can effectively group all sorts of content together. But what am I chunking things _for_?",True

@tyler_russell,2017-04-23T07:07:59Z,1,"@sentdex Great video!  Any reason why the             words = nltk.word_tokenize(i) or tagged = nltk.pos_tag(words) would be outputting thousands of floating numbers to my console?  Works perfectly, but a lot of output.",True
@KillianTattan,2017-04-01T08:56:28Z,4,"@sentdex I've been through your entire nltk tutorial pack - extremely informative and very easy to understand. Easily the best Python tutorial videos online, thanks so much for this! I'm trying to use nltk to chunk emails where theres a paragraph at the end like  ""***CONFIDENTIAL*** This is a confidential email, if you are not the intended recipient....""  Is there a way to do this with chunking and then remove this final paragraph? I can't use a single regular expression because the end paragraph is always worded differently, but about the same confidentially topic",True
@sabr9906,2016-11-15T11:42:46Z,3,"Cool, one tip:  chunkGram and chunkParser should be moved out from the loop.  for i in tokenized[5:]:             words = nltk.word_tokenize(i)             tagged = nltk.pos_tag(words)              chunkGram = r""""""Chunk: {<.*>+}                                     }<VB.?|IN|DT|TO>+{""""""             chunkParser = nltk.RegexpParser(chunkGram)              chunked = chunkParser.parse(tagged)             ...",True
