@carlabest1257,2021-08-18T14:42:17Z,0,"What you are saying about global variables being accessible anywhere is simply not true.  Just about all videos on python are misleading regarding the scoping rules that define so called global variables.   One module cannot ""see"" the global variables in another module without importing that global variable.  That fact that you need to import that global variable from module A does not eliminate the need for modules B,C,and D to import that global variable.   Doesn't sound like a global variable to me.   Sounds like a module variable at best.  Just one more crazy quirk that makes python difficult to use and introduces strange quirky errors.",True
