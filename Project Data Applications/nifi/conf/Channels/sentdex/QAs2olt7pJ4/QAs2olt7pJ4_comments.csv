@uday2794,2020-05-31T19:20:51Z,1,"I changed the iteration loop just a little so that  we don't need to append to a new list for yi in self.data:             for featureset in self.data[yi]:                 max_feature_value = featureset[0]                 min_feature_value = featureset[0]                 for feature in featureset:                     if(max_feature_value < feature):                         max_feature_value = feature                     if(min_feature_value  > feature):                         min_feature_value = feature",True
@davidirimia6463,2020-04-29T11:23:21Z,0,"6:30 I did it with list comprehension (but in my implementation, I structured my data differently). It would be something like:   max( [max( [max(featureset) for featureset in classifier] ) for classifier in data] )",True
@xiaoyang4521,2019-12-26T15:16:55Z,3,"I'd suggest modify the concept illustration video to show SVM is really about finding the hyperplane that has the widest range. W vector and b are respectively doing rotations and shifting. The [5,5] example may confuse people as it's more intuitively like shifting where I think your real intention is to do rotation of the hyperplane.",True

@focker0000,2019-03-27T16:45:49Z,0,doing 'data=None' doesn't mean the GC will do his work and the object is destructed right away... do  'del'  is a good way,True

@rishabhtripathi6290,2018-07-16T18:07:38Z,0,+sentdex ... very nice tutorial sir .... i have a doubt ..can you please explain me in more brief the importance of list of list stored in  transform... what does it signify?  why it has been done so?,True

@Opifex_,2016-06-11T17:01:16Z,0,"I don't get why finding the highest/lowest value is that hard? It's something very common in programming, no? Just start off by defining your max lower than all expected values, and your minimum higher than the expected values. Then iterate through all elements. If an element is higher than the current maximum, replace the value in max with the value you found. Do the opposite with the minimum:  replace the value if the value in the list is smaller than the currect minimum value.",True
