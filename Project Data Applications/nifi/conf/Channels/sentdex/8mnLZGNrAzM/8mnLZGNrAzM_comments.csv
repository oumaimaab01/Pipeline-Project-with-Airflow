@EvilSpeculator,2017-04-14T21:48:38Z,4,"FYI: pd.rolling_std() is deprecated. The new call is:  df['STD'] = df['meters'].rolling(window=2, center=False).std()",True
@TheJanko12345,2017-03-27T18:31:08Z,0,"Hi, I have a dataframe with timestamps that has hourly data for a temp sensor, I need to remove the rows where the sensor is reading the same value for more than 6 hours continuously? Thanks!",True
@willkoehrsen934,2017-03-17T00:54:46Z,9,The use of the rolling window with the std creates several issues. This example removes the 10.21 data point because the std of that point is NaN. The 10.28 data point is also removed as the std associated with that point is largely a result of the preceding high point of 6212.42. Both of these points are reasonable data points and probably should be kept.   I think a better method would be to define the mean and the standard deviation of the bridge heights and then only keep the heights that are less than the mean plus one standard deviation.  df_std = df.describe()['meters']['std'] df_mean = df.describe()['meters']['std']  df = df[ df['meters'] < (df_mean + df_std)]  This keeps all of the bridge heights except for the 6212.,True
@TheVidyaps,2017-02-09T03:15:16Z,2,"with df = df[(df['STD'] < df_std)] - we end up removing 3 rows in total. First row with NaN for STD, and the other 2 where STD is higher than df_std. Is it correct to get rid of 3 rows while we only intended to remove 1 outlier initially?",True

@mrxsal,2016-04-18T16:23:18Z,3,"+sentdex , As +Mohit Chaturvedi points out, this deletes the first data point as it does not have a standard deviation. However, it also deletes the 7th item in the list (10.28)..  So we want to get rid of the invalid data, but using this code it deletes 2 valid data points. Any idea how to get rid only of the invalid datapoint?",True
@mohitchaturvedi1102,2016-03-16T17:29:10Z,3,"Hi sentdex, Great tutorials man!!..Just one doubt, after applying your comparsion, we are also loosing 1st row data as it;s STD deviation is NAN...Any idea how to avoid that?",True
