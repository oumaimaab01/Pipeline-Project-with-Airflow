@mamazu1995,2019-05-21T11:49:04Z,0,"Very great introductory video. The Syntax you showed is the new ES6 Syntax. This is just syntactic suggar for the old way of creating classes. Opposite to other programming languages javascript uses prototypes for objects.   For more information, there is a great video series of FunFunFunction.

@atrumluminarium,2019-05-20T17:48:42Z,0,"Regarding the ""old way"" it is still around (and has been refined further) since it takes up less characters. More characters means larger .js files to send to clients.   Also say we want to make a quick object like a vector it's much faster to slot in (I am using ""•"" for multiplication due to YouTube formatting)  function vector (x,y){  this.x=x;  this.y=y;  this.length=()=>Math.sqrt(this.x•this.x + this.y•this.y); }  And then calling   let v=new vector(1,1);  Personally I prefer this way. That being said, I can remember there being an exception where this didn't cut it but I cannot remember what the situation was.",True
