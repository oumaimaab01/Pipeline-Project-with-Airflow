I have got some question/comment for one bit of the code you generated in this part. When you defining stock_price. I am not sure if you getting all possible values from the dataset.  stock_price = float(source.split(('</small><big><b>'))[1].split('</b></big>')[0]) Basically after compiling the above I noticed that not all tickers are showing up with stock_price and when I looked in their webpage source code I noticed that in some cases the stock price is not directly preceded by '</small><big><b>' phrase.  Check for instance AON page source code.  It looks like that: </small><big><b><span id=""yfs_l10_aon"">46.12</span></b></big> so whatever you passing to float contains a string '<span id=""yfs_l10_aon"">46.12'. I am not sure if this causes a problem with returning stock_price value for AON but it is completely missing. At least in my case.  Maybe I have it wrong so thanks for clarification. Otherwise is there an easy fix for that problem?   Thanks,  Jakub",True
