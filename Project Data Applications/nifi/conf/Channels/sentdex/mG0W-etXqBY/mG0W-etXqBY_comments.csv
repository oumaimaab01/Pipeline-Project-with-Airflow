@Sehyo,2019-02-09T07:44:15Z,0,Stalkers take 2 supply so it should be self.supply_left > 1 instead of >0,True
@szecek,2018-12-21T14:53:31Z,0,I think instead of self.supply_left > 0 you can use function can_feed(),True
@ethanhowlett2227,2018-12-18T15:50:08Z,2,"I had a problem where the AI would not build the gateway or cybernetics core. I noticed that the process would start if I manually made a gateway. So I rearranged the code like this,      async def offensive_force_buildings(self):         if self.units(PYLON).ready.exists:             pylon = self.units(PYLON).ready.random              if len(self.units(GATEWAY)) < 3:                 if self.can_afford(GATEWAY) and not self.already_pending(GATEWAY):                     await self.build(GATEWAY, near=pylon)              elif self.units(GATEWAY).ready.exists and not self.units(CYBERNETICSCORE):                 if self.can_afford(CYBERNETICSCORE) and not self.already_pending(CYBERNETICSCORE):                     await self.build(CYBERNETICSCORE, near=pylon)  And it works fine! Hope this helps anyone out.",True

@AIvetmed,2018-11-04T12:17:24Z,0,I have a doubt!! how have you built stalker from gateway? we can build stalker from cybernetics core only right??? or cybernetics core only unlocks a stalker for us and we can build them via gateway itself!!! which one is true?,True

@martinferreira9401,2018-06-24T15:49:15Z,0,Is there any reason in particular why you chose to pick protoss? Because I've played SC2 for a bit and if u picked Terrans for example you wouldn't have to worry about things like the Pylon placement. They can just build buildings whereever they want. That would make some things easier and you would've more time to focus on the core principles. Still great series though ;) Much love from Germany,True
@bibianaburela,2018-06-24T15:24:58Z,0,"I think I know why you have multiple buildings or units trained when you should only have one. Since all the methods are async, the next step could start before finishing the previous one, and you have a race condition when you do ""if not pending -> build"",  that part should be atomic, since the first thread could have stopped after the if, and before the build.  Another easiest way, would be to just synchronize the on_step with a lock, but since you don't want your python code be running a lot of steps late, you can put an if, that if the lock is acquired, just break. So, you will be skipping some steps, but I don't think that could be a problem.  Sorry for the bad english :D",True

Sounds like a fun idea and then maybe highlight the AI of the bot that wins and maybe tell everyone the tricks they did to do it. I'm a master league SC2 player for like 4 years or something but I've been busy so I know what it takes to win so it sounds like a fun experience to try make a bot to do what I do as a player.  Oh and you might want to remove the already_pending from gateway, you will want to be making quite a few gateways to keep up on production of units for attacking or defending.",True

@DeadWayfes,2018-06-24T14:23:03Z,0,Hi sentdex you could also do the gateway research so that you can warp units in the energy range of a pylon (having a proxy pylon and warp some units there to create a front line) and for a good protoss maybe arround 8 gates should do.
