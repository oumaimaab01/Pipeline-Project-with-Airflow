And your network has 10 possible outcomes  Is it wrong to break the problem down further and create 10 different SVMs, each trained to recognize a single digit?  You'd have to train 10 different svm/networks and then run the virgin image of a digit against all 10.  presumably 9 of the networks would have a value less than .5 and close to 0, while one would have a value of greater than .5 and closer to 1.
