@Veptis,2023-03-09T12:19:54Z,0,Previous image plus movement input. Kinda what was tried with Gan Theft Aufto.  But as for datasets. There is huge repositories with cad models. For like 3D printing there is thingiverse. And there is plenty of paid cad models for like real world parts. Also you buy really 'high fidelity' 3D models for filmmaking with like rigging and stuff (for data augmentation?) and of course game assets. Unity and unreal have stores with a lot of assets. But you have to buy them.   Images can just be crawled. And getting such a massive natural language supervised pairs set like LAION.   And 2D images of all those 3D models are already in those datasets.,True

@mrdragonrider,2022-10-28T23:25:03Z,1,"DreamFusion is a dead end since this is completely unusable in any current 3D processes in movies or games. I suppose the easiest way to explain this is to understand the way 3D is currently constructed. The current 3D construction is discrete math-based and basically folding 2D planes to form a 3D object. From the basic calculus, you will know that it takes an infinite number of vertex and edges to form a perfect circle because it is a continuous and non-divisible curved line. To form a curved surface discretely from a 2D plane, you will need to subdivide the 2d plane a lot. That is the reason a 3D object is referred to as mesh. As the shape gets more curved and complex, the number of vertex and edges required to create that form will exponentially increase needing more and more computing resource to manipulate and render. There is something called retopology in 3D. It is basically a tedious and laborious manual work to reduce the number of vertex and edges while maintaining the shape of high polygon model so that the game assets can be run on a consumer PC.  To be honest, I found this rather annoying because there are so much AI can do to revolutionize the current 3D industry. I mean there is a reason why each new AAA game takes longer and longer to make and hundreds of millions of dollars to create. As a result, the game industry is moving more and more toward easy money from Dopamine addition generated from modern gocha games. Yet, there seems to a gap of between what AI community is doing and the people who understand what AI need to do to make a difference.",True

@sevret313,2022-10-21T15:27:34Z,1,What would be interesting here is if you can use this to create training data for more efficient/higher quality text-to-3D models that doesn't solely need to rely on 2D images. But with the current speed of 30 minutes per 3D model that seem unlikely.,True

,2022-10-20T13:58:41Z,2,"Please, could you define your assertion ""hugely impactful"" at 5:23. My point of view is that Diffusive models (2d or 3d or video) are impressive from a technical point of view but their impact is still to be demonstrated. For generating content.... ok why not but .... why? Do you really think that millions of people will rush in theaters to watch an AI-generated movie? Or to read an AI generated novel? I doubt about it. Now, in the industrial world, we are still at the dark age of using business valuable AI. Mainly because of the lack of massive datasets needed to train these architectures on industrial related domains. Ask any diffusive model to generate something related to a industrial technical topic and you will cry. Even for synthetic dataset, as you said, the limitations are enormous today. So for creating an image of a ""Panda wearing short and surfing in Hawai"" just bravo, impressive. But to make something real valuable I doubt. A better way to spend time and money is to develop GNN in my opinion :)",True
