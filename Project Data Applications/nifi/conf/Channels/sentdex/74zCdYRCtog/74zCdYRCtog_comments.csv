@shoaibmirzaei8227,2019-07-13T12:41:27Z,0,"Hi mr. kinsley your tutorials are amazing I learned too much from them. I have some questions regarding kivy and kv language. 1. I tried to use pure python to add label and buttons to a gridlayout, but it gives error ""Label has no attribute 'fbind' ""; but when I do it in pure kv it works fine. is this a bug? what can I do to overcome this problem? 2. unfortunately I found kivy a little bit late, so I have designed my app in Gtk 3.0 and in python 3.6 instead. now that the code is complete I tried to compile it for windows but I these two are not compatible in windows (they are good in linux). that's why I'm trying to convert it to kivy. do you know a methods equivalent to Gtk.Frame and Gtk.Headerbar in kivy? 3. suppose we have a class with some variables in it like this: class myclass(BoxLayout):      x=5     def __init__(self,**kwargs):           y=6           self.z=7 -------------------- how to access these variables inside kv file? variable x can be accessed through root.x, but the others I don't know how thank you in advance and thank you for your great tutorial videos",True
