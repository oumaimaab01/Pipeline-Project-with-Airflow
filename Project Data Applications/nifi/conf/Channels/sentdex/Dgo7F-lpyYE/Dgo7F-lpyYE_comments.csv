@AdoobII25,2019-11-02T20:15:40Z,113,"Hello sentdex,  usually for sampling rates something called the Nyquist criteria is used for the sampling frequency. It states that the sampling frequency must be at least double the frequency of the signal you're sampling. Brain waves are not pure sinusoids so they're a series of multiple pure sinusoids of differing frequency and phase (aka a Fourier series), you'd want your sampling rate to be higher than the frequency of the last sinusoid in the Fourier series. The problem with sampling at a frequency that's lower than double the frequency of the sampled signal is that when you try to reconstruct your signal (synthesis) the frequency of the reconstructed signal will reflect around the sampling rate (which was lower than the Nyquist rate). For example the maximum frequency of the Gamma waves is 100 Hz, and you used a device to sample the wave at 150 Hz, when you reconstruct the signal you will get a signal at 50 Hz instead of the original 100 Hz, this is called Aliasing which is bad and results in noise, that's why aliasing is a big deal in video graphics :D. The system you are using uses a sampling frequency of 250 Hz as someone else mentioned in the comments so it the acquired signals can be reconstructed without aliasing.",True
