This version, to name one issue,  does not have a fonts directory. And I had a hard time to reproduce most of the Bootstrap stuff in the tutorial.

@MrMoonlightMan,2016-05-08T17:01:46Z,1,Somehow without installing Flask systemwide your approach doesn't work for me. I got a 500 because basically the app can't find flask. I think I should tell the server to activate the environment before running the app. Any thoughts?,True
@kathyz7715,2016-03-30T13:34:04Z,3,"Thanks for the video. It is very useful. Although I noticed that in this tutorial, flask is being installed system wide (/usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/flask), rather than within the virtualenv created (/var/www/FlaskApps/FlaskApp/venv/lib/python2.x/site-packages/flask). For those who would like to limit the installation of flask in the virtualenv only, make sure to run 'pip install flask' without sudo after activating the virtualenv, and also add the following lines in the .wsgi file as specified in Flask documentation http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/  activate_this = '/path/to/env/bin/activate_this.py' execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))",True

@geekverve,2015-12-17T05:51:38Z,0,"My understanding of virtualenv was that it provides an isolated environment, but only when activated (monkeying with path variables while active and changing them back when deactivated).  Since you deactivated your venv after installing Flask, I'm not sure I see the point of setting up the virtual environment, especially when you never activate it again.

@MrAverageViewer,2015-01-22T22:03:33Z,2,"Harrison, just a few questions from the perspective of me being someone totally new to the world of coding.    I find most of the so-called ""beginner"" tutorials require extensive prerequisite knowledge.   While I'm concurrently learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python fundamentals, this entire setup process is very daunting with all the lines of code that have to be memorized.    Moreover, it's difficult understanding the context and rationale for why certain lines of of code are being typed, and what exactly they mean.  In other words, I can't see the forest because all I see are trees -- hence the context is absent.  It may be ""easy"" for experienced coders or people in the programming world, but not for individuals (NON-techies) coming from a totally different background just getting started.  That said, please kindly advise on the following:  1)  Is there possibly an easier way to get Flask setup, or perhaps a Softaculous method of having it auto-installed in hosting service -- I mean, similar to the way Wordpress or Drupal have one-click installation on hosting companies?  2)  Assuming one uses Flask to build a website, does that totally negate the need, use, or integration of a Python-based CMS such as Mezzanine or any other Python CMS?  And, can, or do Flask applications integrate with such CMSs?  3)  Do you plan do make any videos that might explain how specific FOLDERS & FOLDER STRUCTURES interrelate with the Flask program, as well as with other folders?  In other words, what specific file folders could I even begin to create, PRIOR to even beginning a Flask project.  It's very beginner stuff, but I believe essential.  4)  What prerequisite videos have you made that might make this particular Flask Tutorial series a bit more understandable?  Lots of questions, I know.  You're feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much.",True

Have been working on flask app recently... app.debug='True' or app.run(debug=""True') will work fine when you are running  it on local via lets say eclipse pydev or pycharm or something. When you host it via mod-wsgi your if block is never actually passed and app.run() is actually never called from there. This is actually just for running locally (where you will run your init file for starting application) Application here starts via your wsgi file. Try putting app.debug='True' outside your if block if you haven't already. Not sure if there is a special way to run it.",True
