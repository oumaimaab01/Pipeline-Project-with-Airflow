@realArisawaHeavyInd,2018-10-07T03:38:42Z,0,"Hey Dex. If I understand the nomenclature here correctly, when you refer to transfer learning, is this basically repurposing a pretrained model (say, Inception) with custom training data for a specific task (say, GTA obj detection)? If you were to do this to train Charles better, what training data would you use? Would you train on GTA screenshots? Would that mean that you'd have to manually go through all that data and manually draw your own bounding boxes? Lmk if that's the case, because I've been working on a custom real-time obj detector for FPS games and I may (may) be able to save you some time with the annotation process. Not sure how much data you'd need for Charles, but I ended up with 100,000+ training images for my own project and was about to hire Indians to annotate it all for me when I realized there's a better way",True

@starfightlp5124,2018-10-06T22:11:10Z,5,Idea for improvement: maybe when an object was detected start a tracker on that object (I think opencv has a set built-in) so it doesn't disappear so easily.

@opokusm,2018-10-06T14:31:21Z,70,"The main reason models don't detect distant objects is because all of them have relatively small input resolution (usually 300X300 pixels) and whatever resolution input you pass, it gets automatically resized to this input shape, losing a lot of details needed to detect objects. Also game world is slightly different from real world and that is enough for weaker (and because of that faster) models to fail to generalize to the way cars, and other objects of interest, look in GTAV world and as a result fail to detect them. I would advice to try transfer learning with around half of training data consisting of random frames taken from game, there is no need to label them by hand, simply take the most accurate model from object detection api and use its predictions, should be more than enough to train better fast model. Reducing amount of classes to predict, also helps small models to reach better accuracy.",True
