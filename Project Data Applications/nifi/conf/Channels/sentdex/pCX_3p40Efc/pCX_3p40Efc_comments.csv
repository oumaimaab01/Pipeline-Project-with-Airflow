I studied civil engineering at Imperial College London and can tell your ability to convey ideas and teach is unprecedented! Plus it's always fun. I recall the first model I made, thanks to you, a binary classification model about breast cancer in 2019! Still here. I am starting a tech startup for logistics. I hope I can make it, and give back to you for so much you've already given me.",True

@johnblomberg389,2024-03-10T22:25:39Z,2,"Hi Sentdex!  First of all thanks for the video, it's interesting as always to see you tinker with this stuff and I'm really learning a lot :) after your previous videos with the WSB bot I decided to create my own scraper to collect comments from the daily WSB threads. I have just kept it running every now and then on my local computer and collected something like 57 mb of conversation data. I believe it is 229 000 comment threads, some of them are longer and some of them shorter. It has not been properly cleaned so there are also threads with only one comment in them but even after removing that it should be at least 150k of threads which are recent (collected during mid 2023 until now)  If you want to play around with it I can clean it and upload it somewhere :)",True

@bennguyen1313,2024-03-07T15:26:30Z,0,"I've seen some people use Google Colab / Jupyter - Spyder..   how does training using those compare to Google Cloud?  Can a python application access a model running on the cloud for free (Google Colab).. or are there no free options?  What's the cheapest?  For example, aside from cloud services that host LLMs (railway , modal, render, beam cloud ,  Replicate , Streamlit , replit), I could run Ollama on my own computer and run models (Llama2 (XB), Mistral 7B, etc)?    The downside is that my python API would need to be written for a specific API?  For example, OpenAPI , Gemini, OpenAI's Assistant API , Au Mistral, Gemini Pro, llama2 , FastAPI are all different?",True

@BoobieBusiness,2024-03-06T20:01:45Z,6,"At 32:15 you mention to be unsure of the meaning of the parent id's in the dataset. The reddit post you linked to the BigQuery contains a SELECT statement with REGEXP_REPLACE of 't[0-9]_' on the link_id. According to GPT-4, link_id is a field that represents the ID of the post (submission) to which a comment belongs. Reddit IDs for posts and comments, often prefixed with a type indicator t1-t6 are: Comment, Account (user), Link (post or submission), Message (private message), Subreddit, Award  If you did not filter the data frame on ids starting with t1_, then you might have fine-tuned the model on all types of content, not just comments/conversations. If so, it might explain why adding all those other subreddits messed with the training process (as the prompt template is not formatted for other types of content).",True
