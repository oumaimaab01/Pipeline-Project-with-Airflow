@nerddog9385,2018-06-28T09:13:03Z,0,I understood why he removed one classifier while calling the voting class. Because number of classifiers was even including that classifier. So there is a possibility that mode function may raise error when there are  two most frequent items. ie; pos = 4 and neg =4. He cleverly avoided that situation by making the number of classifiers odd.,True
