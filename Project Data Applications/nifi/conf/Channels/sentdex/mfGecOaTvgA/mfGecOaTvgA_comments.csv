@olha_,2022-03-15T00:03:18Z,0,"I haven't watched any of the NNFS videos in a long time and can't remember them very well at this point, but as for similar content that includes all the low-level nitty-gritty detail, there's the old Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera and it's been around for ages. So it's not like NNFS is only thing like that out there.",True
@gamestroyer891,2022-03-14T15:21:28Z,0,"Hey Sentdex,   Please allow me to apologize for what I said, did, etc‚Ä¶ on your discord. My behavior was extremely inappropriate, immature, and lacked the respect you all deserved. It was a disruption and distracted others from having fun.  It was embarrassing, but I learned that nobody appreciated my poor behavior. In the future, I have every intention of curbing my thoughtless actions and learn to adjust my behavior befitting the environment and situation.  Again, I am sorry for my actions and I hope that we can put this matter behind us. I look forward to hanging out with you all. If you have any thoughts in this, please feel free to share. You may contact me at your convenience at reddit pm's.  Sincerely, jadoo#2090.",True
@aaravbhatt760,2022-03-12T10:14:37Z,0,"Well, I got the book when I was 14. I understood the basics about how it worked and it gave me a good understanding of calculus (which was new to me at the time - I have got much better at it now). However, I quickly moved to tensorflow, which seemed easier. Now, I am rereading the book again to get a deeper knowledge of neural networks (I have just turned 16 now). It would be nice to see a follow-up book about convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks and and transformers.",True

It cost a pretty penny to get it here to Australia, but it was well worth it.  Thanks to both of you Harrison and Daniel, the work you out in to the books really shows.",True

@g4anode,2022-03-09T22:39:52Z,0,"My NNFS book was left in the rain for a whole night (got delivered super late in the evening, which I didn't notice). I found out the book was remarkably resistant to water, with pages being only somewhat distorted after drying for a week. After keeping it under a weight for a while (please don't remind me how long it's been since release, I'm still procrastinating lol) it all but straightened out and you could never tell it got wet.  You reminded me of this when you mention shipping straight up losing packages haha.",True
@Kevin_KC0SHO,2022-03-09T22:35:28Z,0,"The book is amazing, and truly is a great price.  It contains better information that many of the college books I purchased (and kept), at about half the cost or less.",True
@TheRysiu120,2022-03-09T22:23:03Z,0,"The nnfs series as you say does not compare to anything else available on this platform and I understand that you have a lot of new projects worthy of realization and I would not for anything want you to burn out because it would be an irreparable loss. However if you say it takes 2 weeks then maybe you could do it so that you put one episode maybe once every 3 - 4 months, it sounds doable. Of course I know that you probably will not change your way of uploading videos and in no way will I try to convince you to do so, but I just loved these videos for the fact that I can learn from them and I feel that by the time this series is over I will have graduated :D First of all, keep up the good work and stay true to your vision. Can I at least ask when approximately the next episode will come out, will it be more like 3 months, half a year or a year? And how many episodes by default do you plan for this series to have?",True
@CitizensCommunity,2022-03-09T21:30:27Z,0,"The book is an amazing product at a great price, that was clearly made by people who care. The videos have been amazing and helped me understand a point I was stuck on. I am going from not knowing how to program and jumping to NNs, your book has been what has made that possible. While other videos are able to help with a deeper understanding of some parts, your videos have been the best way to get the information. Complaints that the videos are not released sooner are just a demonstration of how valuable people are finding the videos, and the loss they feel when they do not have the next one. Please do not undervalue the importance these videos have, but you are also not a youtube slave and need to take care of yourself and your goals as well.",True
@tahababazadeh8444,2022-03-09T21:03:36Z,0,Hi sir I watch your videos from iran and so far it has been quite helpful just like your videos on other people no doubt about that but since we cant transfer money internationally even if i had 1 b dollar i couldn't pay  thats why i am really relying on the videos. thanks anyway,True

@MartinPHellwig,2022-03-09T16:50:46Z,18,"The book is definitely worth it, very well written. In regards of the nnfs video's being less frequent, well you have been burning the candle on both ends in an open fire, so I actually applaud you for taking steps to not burn out on it.",True

@jasonsachinger3276,2022-03-09T16:49:14Z,7,I pre-ordered the book when you first announced it. But I've been waiting for all the videos to be released before actually going through the book as the videos really help lock in the understanding. I'll admit that I felt like you dropped the videos to move on to new things and I was loosing hope. I understand you have other interests and opportunities but I felt like the book and the videos were put forward as part of the package so I was expecting the videos to come on a better pace. I'm not saying you explicitly marketed it this way but that is the impression I received so my expectations were based on that. I appreciate your hard work and continued efforts on the videos.,True
