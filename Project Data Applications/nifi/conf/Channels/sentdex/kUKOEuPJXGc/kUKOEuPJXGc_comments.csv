@yashchavan1350,2020-09-04T15:48:43Z,0,what is the importance of the processes argument in Pool.cause I altered it no change in output nor in time(by timeit).,True
@PavanKumar8,2020-05-27T17:28:49Z,0,"Hi sentdex, Thanks for a wonderful channel. I would like your opinion on the following results. No of cores = 4, Problem :  Making a list of [num*2 for i in range(20000)], without any explicit print or I/O operations. Option A: Multiprocessing with processes = 4,;Time taken is 0.15s Option B: Normal list comprehension; Time taken = 0.003 s. This doesn't make sense to me on why option A is so much slower. Am I missing anything obvious?",True

@antoninvyslouzil8159,2018-10-12T11:43:49Z,0,"Hey sentdex!!! Love your channel, been watching your python videos for about a month now and now I found myself in a bit of a pickle. All the code from last 70 videos worked like a charm. Not this one, this one is giving me real headache. For some reason I dont get any data displayed in Python 3.6.6 window (IDLE). Code from previous video with ""spawn"" works just fine and displays the correct result in terminal. When I run the code covered in this video in terminal it also displays the correct result just fine. I tried almost everything I can think of, reinstalled Ubuntu and tryed again, still no go... When I try to run the same code in IDLE using Python3 on windows(also fresh install) it works both in command prompt and in IDLE. I am gobsmacked at this point.  The app I am trying to write will eventually end up beeing run on windows machine so I am not worried about it too much, but I would like to keep using Ubuntu while studying to learn a little bit about it as well. Got this ""challenge accepted!!!"" moment about a month ago and its still going strong thanks to you. The moment I found your Starcraft 2 videos I fell in love with this channel, so GL HF! And if you decide to react on a long post on a 2 year old video I dont know what I will do :D",True
@sovanraksa2112,2018-05-16T04:03:48Z,0,"I was wondering if there’s a difference between pool and a process. In my opinion, it’s the same but maybe I’m wrong. I watched codebasics on the pool thing and he said that the input the map function takes in, it divides equally into 4 and use it to apply to the function but with the 4 cores of the CPU. And he said it was parallel process. And then it returns the output combined together as an array or a list. So if that’s the case pool is also a process?",True
@wilfreddv,2017-08-13T15:03:19Z,1,"What does the Pool(processes=20) do? Does it run the function job() 20 times, or does it use 20 processes for job(), or could you have a maximum of 20 processes pass data to eachother?",True
@jonmerladet6465,2017-06-10T11:54:49Z,0,could you do a quick sort in which each recursive call goes to a different processor?,True
@_adaldo,2016-12-01T19:26:24Z,2,Is there any relation between the number of processes in the pool and the length of the list that we pass to `map`?,True

@tiobraulio,2016-11-15T22:25:13Z,0,Did you ever make any test of performance using multiprocessing?. Today I had some contradictory results when I found slower performances when multiprocessing is used.,True
@NotMarkKnopfler,2016-11-15T21:20:01Z,0,"This is useful. Thank you. Looking forward to the object oriented presentations. I'm trying to do objects in Python and they are kicking my ass. Simple classes/objects are okay but static classes, static methods and inheritance are nasty. I can do all this stuff in Java but I'm not warming to Python syntax which I find to be very cryptic.",True
@SwapnilSingh4u,2016-11-15T17:47:19Z,0,dear bro.....one thing I always wanted to build in python and that is .....I want to get an API or some website(scrapping) to place a calling (telephone calling) function from the python program......I have not tried yet (I have scrapped texts alot)  but if u have any suggestions whether it could be made possible through the terminal( telephone calling ) then pls give some hints......!,True
