@alexsimon1473,2020-10-28T01:52:14Z,0,"Thanks for the video Sir John 3 :35  The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  36 He that believeth on the Son(Jesus Christ) hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.""  Jesus Christ is real. if you don't keep his commandments the wrath of God abideth on you(which will be forever in hell)  Repent and turn your life to Christ before Judgment day comes.  Many people will disagree and mock you trust me, but its worth it for an eternity praising our Creator. As Jesus said ""if they hate you remember they first hated me""(John 15:18). Read the bible, start from the New testament. God bless you. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.(Joh.3:3)How to be born again? You can not(like how you wasn't physically born by your own will) by your own will, but what you can do is ask God (Mat 7:7 for the rest..)",True
