@calebshafer2569,2020-03-20T12:56:49Z,0,"Great job on the vids!  This may be a little too advanced and over doing the code but say the front sensor detects an obstacle but the left and right ones don't so the robot picks a random one, and the direction chosen results in a closed path. How would the robot reverse it's exact path?",True
@tejendraprajapati7079,2019-02-10T10:49:50Z,1,In this program generate error  no module name sensor Please help,True
@KiranKumar-hq6mb,2017-09-29T14:14:42Z,0,"Hey! Your videos are damn good! But the problem is I have to rotate the wheels by a specific angle once it finds an obstacle, I know I have to use pwm and a different chassis, but how will the bot work, will it require another motor, where will I fix it, can you just elaborate the solution.",True
@perpetualtom6649,2017-08-15T21:41:09Z,0,you are the man sentdex <3,True
@betoch7556,2016-11-23T15:28:43Z,0,if i want to control just one motor at a time?,True
@tubeDude48,2016-07-11T02:03:39Z,0,"Where's robot4.py, because it wasn't created in a past video!",True
@GodLee3,2015-04-22T23:49:05Z,0,Do this on work for user input only? My sensor read it less than 20cm but it does not move,True
@ahmednouman9871,2014-09-02T17:01:02Z,0,"i could not get it to work :( ,, should it be something like this?can you show me the codes for the forward function?  def forward(tf):     curDis = distance('cm')          if curDis < 20:         pass     else:         gpio.output(x, True)      # let say          gpio.output(x,False)         time.sleep(tf)         gpio.cleanup()",True
@ahmednouman9871,2014-09-01T08:51:59Z,0,"THANKS for this great tutorial ,, but i have got one question what should I do if I want it to ignore any forward commands rather than reverse, like you can only turn left or right but no forward,,,, I hope you reply because  really wanna do it for my project ",True
@Anthony-ry8lo,2014-06-28T20:48:07Z,0,Too Cool just got my scr04 in and it works! Thanks,True
