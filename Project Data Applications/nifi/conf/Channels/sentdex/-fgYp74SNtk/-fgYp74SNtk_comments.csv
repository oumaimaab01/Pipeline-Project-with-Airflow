@Anskurshaikh,2021-04-08T06:19:55Z,0,"Damn, the drop off on the views per video is really telling lol. I gotta say the first few videos in the playlist probably would've scared away those who are not comfortable with coding.",True
@user-uy1gn2kv5t,2020-10-15T21:35:03Z,0,thank you!!!!,True
@geogeo14000,2020-07-31T11:33:27Z,0,"Great video as usual but one thing I don't get is the purpose of doin all this if we already have y_hat, the best fit line. Isn't it what we are supposed to search for ? (sorry for naive question im totally new to ML and missing a lot of things XD)",True
@ygbr2997,2020-07-10T06:18:00Z,0,what if all the points have the same y value,True
@abhishekmamdapure,2019-09-04T17:24:12Z,0,"Dude, you really want to learn what to put a title for the video, not even showed any of the python interface",True
@ahbarahad3203,2019-07-28T07:52:00Z,2,"""that's pretty goood"" for a moment I thought this is 2015",True
@pg5353,2019-05-15T12:59:28Z,3,Is this the cost or the loss function??,True
@hansmeier340,2018-11-23T15:21:36Z,0,"What metric are you using when you say ""e is the distance to the line""? 2:06",True
@Marva123,2018-08-12T02:41:49Z,7,@sentdex how do you know so much about programming. I'm interested in always learning from people who are very knowledgeable. What was your path of learning for all this different areas?,True
@CannabiiiisX,2018-05-24T12:25:53Z,1,"Realy enjoying the series sentdex ! i think its funny when looking at the views you see them decreasing every new episode , while i think its just getting funt at this point and i cant wait to have completed the series ! Your doing a great job , thx for your time and effort ! i was pleased for givning you the 420th like on this video :D",True
@wanderlust660,2018-05-01T15:21:14Z,0,"You could also use chi^2 or calculate the error of the slope. If you have a model, e.g. say the slope is the velocity (y the distancem x the time) it would give you the error of your best fit velocity.",True
@rubinluitel158,2018-01-05T04:59:25Z,1,"i still don't understand why you cant take the absolute vale, because if you square it to any numbers, results should be the same right, in terms of the distance",True
@bobestes2261,2017-09-20T05:32:24Z,13,"A key point, not mentioned, is that the use of squared error leads to the solution that was previously presented.  Using other error measures implies a different optimization problem and results in other formulas for m and b.   Furthermore, the properties of squared error are what lead to the nice, closed form solution we used previously.  Many other error measures do not permit simple, closed form solutions.",True
@archanamasilamani5115,2017-09-12T05:22:52Z,0,Great explanation.. Thank u :),True
@coolunknown7846,2017-08-04T13:28:39Z,0,which program do you use for making these theory videos?,True
@willwombell3045,2017-07-17T11:12:31Z,1,"Quick question, for the squared error of the y hat line do you take it perpendicular to the line like you do for the squared error of the y mean line or do you use the vertical error for both and if so why? Thanks, love the vids.",True
@shravilpotdar,2017-06-13T19:04:27Z,3,"sentdex  Hi, why should we get a high value of r^2 (squared error) while calculating the squared error? Doesn't it mean that, the high value of r^2 means high error? :)",True
@ZarreenNaowalReza,2017-05-19T06:13:02Z,1,Can you please explain exactly how are we reducing the impact of outliers by squaring their distances from the best fit line?,True
@ericvantassell6809,2017-04-06T03:38:28Z,0,Have you ever seen Monty Python' and the Holy Grail?  Specifically the part where they consult the Book of Armaments to deploy the Holy Hand Grenade? speed it up a bit brother this is too painful to watch,True
@syedamanahilrizvi8937,2017-03-29T11:25:26Z,0,Hi Buddy! your explanation is absolutely excellent. I want to ask you that if possible please add a video on adjusted R square. Also tell the methods which are used to test accuracy of Linear Regression,True
@yaweichen9773,2017-03-12T04:51:27Z,32,"you actually could use the absolute value of e, or e to any powers to calculate the norm of the error. But for least square problems, we generally use e^2 because we could easily differentiate the function.",True

@EditorsCanPlay,2016-07-17T20:40:31Z,0,"So, just wondering, if you use e^6 does that change the r^2 equation in any way?",True
@rasmusloqvist7725,2016-05-24T15:40:02Z,0,"Hey! Very nice series!  I was just wondering if a viable way of doing a measurement of how good it fits can be done with the rmse between yhat and the original y's?  something like this:  rmse = sum([(k-l)**2 for k, l in zip(y, yhat)])**0.5",True
@janekmuric,2016-04-21T21:14:33Z,0,"I'm a bit confused with the r^2 equation.   First of all, does the coefficient of determination apply to the entire regression line or just a single data point in that dataset?  So how would you get SEÅ·? I assume it's the length between _the point you are figuring out the CoD for_ and _the point on the regression line on the same x coordinate_ squared?  And SE mean(y)? I honestly have no idea how to get that one :)  Lets say: mean(y) = 10 point coordinates = (5, 7)  What do I do now? I have no idea. And again, I could be making up nonsense if the CoD was supossed to apply to the whole regression line.  Anyways keep up the awesome new videos, I look forward to them every day :)",True
