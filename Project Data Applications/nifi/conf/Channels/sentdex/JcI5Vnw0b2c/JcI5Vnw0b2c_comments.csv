@RayCarrender,2017-12-23T17:55:49Z,0,"If you are like me and you like to run the code over and over as you toy with it, but end up getting locked out of quandl, I suggest adding a small way to store the data (since it's stale anyways) (it also makes it run quite a bit faster as it doesn't have to constantly pull the data down).  TICKER = 'WIKI/GOOGL'  #Let's pickle some quandl data to speed this up, the data is stale anyways: def upcertData(fileName, loadingMethod):  try:    pickle_in = open(fileName, 'rb')   result = pickle.load(pickle_in)   print('loaded data from pickle')  except(OSError, IOError) as error:    print('pickle data lost to the aether or never existed, reimporting')   result = loadingMethod()   with open(fileName, 'wb') as f:    pickle.dump(dataFrame, f)  return result   def loadDataFrame():  return upcertData('googlStock.pickle', getQuandlData)  def getQuandlData():  return quandl.get(TICKER)    #Exec  df = loadDataFrame()  To be clear, this replaces the df = Quandl.get('WIKI\GOOGL') line from above.  Also what it's doing here: I've created a reusable method for most future pickling (won't work with the video that actually has the pickle tutorial because clf.fit instantiates other objects outside of the classifier when called) that allows for an instantiation method to be called in. Here we could have used a lambda instead but since python only allows single line lambda's and I had signed up for a quandl account, I wanted to keep using my api key (which requires multiple lines).   Anyways, I hope this is helpful to anyone trying to speed up there application and maybe lower there hits to quandl while doing the tutorial.",True
