@yaboiiprettyeyez,2020-12-27T01:05:11Z,0,"Hey SentDex, Love your content, man! was wondering if you could help me out. I am using minima and maxima points to keep track of previous support and resistance levels using code below:  from scipy.signal import argrelextrema max_idx = argrelextrema(highp, np.greater) min_idx = argrelextrema(lowp, np.less) maximaPrices = highp[max_idx] minimaPPrices = lowp[min_idx]  # Where, # highp and lowp are numpy arrays. # highp = myDF['High'] .to_numpy() and # lowp = myDF['Low'] .to_numpy()  # I would like to get the distance from each low point to the next relative higher high and draw a line from said low to high. Could you help me out, pls?",True
@loyolagold,2017-05-09T16:28:59Z,0,can you code for Richard Love's superperformance stock? also how would the code look like of we were to find stocks which have increased at least by 50% over 2 quarters?,True
@cfoch3,2017-02-23T14:45:27Z,0,Hi. How can I do this without depending on Quantopian or that's the business :) ?,True
@harshpahel,2016-05-05T20:22:29Z,0,"Hi +sentdex first of all thank you for creating such a nice series of tutorials :) Secondly I have  a question: So this is not actually achieving the target for the stock, rather achieving the target of how much we want to invest. For example, if I bought a stock at 100, and my target price for that stock is 120, with a stoploss of 90. How do we do that?",True
@johnji5369,2016-04-26T01:45:21Z,0,"Thank you so much for the amazing insrtuctions. I believe you know Quantopian had recently upgraded to 2.0 which means some of the basic functions are changed. I am pretty new and it is hard for me to transform the codes just by reading their migration guide. There is no any other tutorial better than yours out there, I will be the first buyer of your updated course if you sold it on Udemy or somewhere else.",True
@0xsuperman,2016-02-01T03:50:13Z,0,Can we actually trade (with real money and broker) on Quantopian or is it just for backtest or paper trade?,True
@_______6398,2015-11-05T19:42:02Z,0,"+sentdex Hey Harrison, thanks for your very informative Quantopian tutorial series. I've really been enjoying and learning a ton from them. I'm currently a undergrad junior in college studying finance, mathematical/quantitative finance, and economics but just recently started learning how to code for algorithmic trading, a passion of mine. I'm fairly still a novice and was wondering why, when I backtest from the same range of dates shown in your video with the exact same strategy (from 01/03/2002 to 06/17/2015), I get different back testing results; my total returns, alpha, beta, sharpe ratio, etc are all different from your results when I used the same strategy within the same frame of time. Could you please explain this?",True
@kk141281,2015-08-30T13:53:48Z,9,What did you buy from Victoria Secret?? :P,True
@XpLoeRe,2015-08-22T09:53:54Z,0,Hey bro love your vids! Question: is there a way to make it find certian types of candels that get out of the upper bollinger? :P,True
@johnaward6703,2015-08-09T17:20:26Z,0,"Ok, as far as I'm conserned that was our cover, right? if ma1>ma2:             order_target_percent(stock, 0.11)",True
@aaronchan571,2015-07-29T05:53:40Z,0,"sentdex Excellent series! Question about the pre_func key_word from the fetch_csv() function. I've followed the same steps as you and got the script running. But I'm wondering how you were able to specify preview, instead of preview(df) which you defined as a method outside of the initalize method, when inputting pre_func?  Thanks!",True
@Neceros,2015-07-06T01:48:38Z,0,"Wait, so, you can essentially sell stocks you don't have and call it shorting? lol Finance is fucked up.",True
@Neceros,2015-07-06T01:39:59Z,0,"Let me understand this. To play the sectors, what you're doing is investing in a sector on its way up, and selling as it goes down, in order to have money in a viable sector at any given time?   I apologize if my questions are inane. Sometimes I start to understand and I need to clarify before I can continue understanding.",True
@thinkmoreyoulivebetter6879,2015-07-04T03:33:43Z,0,"Hi, sentdex. I was wondering if you could make videos about how to make a simple compiler on python. I'll be waiting for your answer. Thank you.",True
@jamielunn5869,2015-07-04T01:01:54Z,0,Looking forward to the next video! As a future request: perhaps you can show us how to combine multiple strategies and/or build a pair trading strategy using multiple pairs?,True
@markfrancis905,2015-07-03T16:10:44Z,0,I'm also really enjoying this series. I still have some issues with running anything beyond research in a cloud environment. I looked into Zipline and had some real issues hooking it up to my database. Has anyone had any experiences migrating from Quantopian to Zipline?,True
@lolnickfox,2015-07-03T14:57:08Z,0,first! Really enjoying this series!,True
