It has a function at the end which takes a few arguments and produces a json file. I have written an html file with a dropdown menu which shows me which name I selected on the webpage. But I do not know how to get this string as an argument for my python script and then run my python script to produce the json file. Everything is done on localhost for now, how could I solve this issue? Any help would be appreciated, thanks",True

@SerottaPDX,2017-07-07T22:57:37Z,0,"Hi Harrison, I know that this video is from a while ago, but I found that I can use pycharm as a replacement for all these tools listed here. I use a mac, but this could easily be done in windows or linux.   You can set up SFTP over a remote server through pycharm and push code that way directly to the server. You can also clone an entire directory and have the changes uploaded automatically. Also, with the terminal built in, everything is right there in my dock. I can restart apache from pycharm.   Note, the remote server has to be configured from the professional license... so there is that.   The last tool I think might be good for beginners is bootstrap studio. It makes building websites a piece of cake, and the user can focus on the logic behind python as opposed to learning a different front end language.   Thanks again for all your videos!",True

@insaneviruss,2014-09-25T13:14:35Z,2,"hi, you might not want to reload apache everytime(especially if other apps are running in it). Instead you can use 'WSGIScriptReloading On' in your Apache flaskapp.config file and then just use 'touch flaskapp.wsgi' command. This way your changes will reflect immediately.",True
