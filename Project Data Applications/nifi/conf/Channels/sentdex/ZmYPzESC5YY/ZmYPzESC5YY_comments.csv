You always give a good point of view slightly different of what I have found on other tutorials.  Today I make a comment cause I was just seeing this tutorial of live plotting and I saw that with my data I saw that my x-axis the data was not taken in ascending order instead was (1,10,2,3,4...) when you passed to the 2 digit number.  What I did is that I just added the int() to each append of the ""xs"" and ""ys"" and this solved the issue.  Thanks again for your videos dude.",True

A small advice here: I tried the way to read files and read lines following this episode, but the .append() methods would resulted in 'the only additional stores in both xs[ ] and ys[ ], and the figure could only add more elements upon the history rather than clear the xs[ ]  and ys[ ], what if we want to delete some data from the original sheet and display lively?

@ThomsonVarghese22,2017-08-24T10:50:40Z,1,This is excellent! Exactly what I was looking for to display live data from a DAQ system. The only question I have is the use of append. I am worried to use around as my csv files will have 1000s of lines of data and  I have heard that appending could cause memory problems. Thinking I will initialize xs and ys = [0] x len(lines),True
