@oldaccountyeet5765,2017-04-22T06:38:00Z,0,"Great video! I will be watching the rest of your series!   I just wanted to offer some help for those having trouble installing matplotlib. Maybe somebody figured it out because its 2017 now anyways but I will go ahead and write out how I did it.  I currently run Python 3.6.1 and am using PyCharm. Within PyCharm itself, I went to preferences > project > project interpreter. From here, I make sure the interpreter is the latest version of Python I am using and below there is a list for installed packages and their version information. At the bottom of the list is a handy little ""+"" icon. The ""+"" icon brings you to a menu where you can search for an available package and install it. Luckily enough, matplotlib was in there! Not only that, but it also concurrently installs everything else that matplotlib needs!",True
