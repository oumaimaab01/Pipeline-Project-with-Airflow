You explain things really simply and motivate me to keep learning.   One thing I have to say about this one, though, is that I had liked all the videos in this series until this one, but it seems like the course just leaped from assuming only basic knowledge to assuming A LOT of preexisting technical knowledge about stderr, stdout, sys.argv, PHP etc without explaining them. This lesson went completely over my head and I think it was aimed more towards experienced coders who are new to the sys module than towards beginner coders.

If I may, I have a small problem understanding something about this tutorial;  entering python sis.py (just doesnt work)  entering sis.py (gives off the complete directory adress)  and entering py -3 sys.py (gives the file name  i.e. sys.py)   I found the py -3 online and am running python version 3.51 but so is a friend of mine and your example works fine for him. Would really appreciate a clarification on this! but can understand if you don`t have the time.   Either way, keep up the good work and thanks!  :D",True

@andyhandy7591,2015-08-20T01:40:00Z,2,"First of all, big thanks. You really helped me out starting from zero, learning to program in these tutorials. But in this lesson I have some trouble. I think it has to do with my python installation on a mac: Mac has python 2.7 installed by default. I have installed Python 3.4.  The terminal will not open the sys.py file  (My guess is that it is doing that because it reads .py in python 2.7 by default).  I can open the file however with the Python Launcher which is the right python 3.4 edition, but it logs out and says 'proces completed' after which I can't type in anything.  I can open python3 in the terminal by typing python3 in the beginning but still, opening this file is not working so far. Thanks again, Andy",True

@themolynator5127,2014-12-16T09:24:11Z,12,"hey im a little confused here.  1.  so stdin, stdout are just used for printing input/output text as in prompts? and stderr is for red error text?  Im unclear on what other uses these have.  2. having trouble with argv.  i think naming the file sys.py is a little confusing.  I take it you had two identical files ( lets name them temp1.py and misc2.py. ) in two different folders (one at c:/code and other c:/code/testdir) with these lines in them:  import sys print(sys.argv)  So if im right the main idea is youre able to pass values (arguments) back and forth between one or two python scripts via the command line?  sort of like printing or modifying file contents through CLI?  also I tried typing python misc2.py in cli and it said cant find file (in either folder). so somethings up with my path.  i standard installed python and checked the add py to path option.  feels like i need to add another line to env variables, googled this issue and couldnt get a clear answer.  thanks for help, sorry if this is long im meticulous and just got hung up on this lesson",True
