@FlotteeMottee,2024-01-05T13:23:02Z,0,"Ein weiteres fesselndes Tutorial! Deine Erklärungen zum Angriff und zur Niederlage des Feindes in Starcraft 2 mit Python sind unglaublich lehrreich. Es ist großartig zu sehen, wie du komplexe Konzepte so verständlich vermittelst. Deine Tutorials machen es wirklich einfach, in die Welt der Starcraft 2 AI-Entwicklung einzutauchen. Vielen Dank für dein Engagement und die informativen Inhalte!",True

@Fadeinwow,2023-09-10T20:30:07Z,0,Your saving up to much bank. Should have built more star gates. Could have had double the voids with your first push,True

@WalterBurkholder,2023-01-31T19:56:47Z,0,"Heya I just noticed you can save your game replay:  def main():     sc2.run_game(sc2.maps.get(""Abyssal Reef LE""), [         Bot(Race.Terran, MyBot()),         Computer(Race.Zerg, Difficulty.Easy)     ], realtime=False, save_replay_as=""Example.SC2Replay"")  Since this shows the game with everything revealed, can this be used to train our AI better when we get into deep learning again? Just a thought.",True

@JokeryEU,2022-09-19T18:21:08Z,0,why these videos stopped at part 3 ?,True
@JOHNSMITH-ve3rq,2022-07-08T08:26:55Z,0,I'm really confused -- why can't you just train the model on a TONNE of player data? Isn't that how they trained alphago etc? Why not simply use the same methods that have been established for AI to beat games (whether chess or go). Surely starcraft doesn't have wildly more parameters or complexity than those games. Hand crafting all these if else rules seems really counterintuitive as a way to train an AI model??,True
@Veptis,2022-06-28T22:37:19Z,0,"All I am learning is that async in python turns out messy. And that here is only rules applied, no learning.",True
@EranM,2022-05-05T14:35:38Z,0,bruhhhhhhhh sentdex just build my pylons when u have 8 more room left.. so you wont hard stop at 5 and wont be supply blocked!! !:>>>,True
@krowven,2022-05-03T00:22:53Z,0,I've been watching these and I can't help but wonder if someone has decompiled Starcraft II and looked at the AI using the internal logic. I'm sure it's a similar set of nest if's with handicaps. (i.e. units cost less with lower build times),True
@vladimirtchuiev2218,2022-04-28T12:45:45Z,1,"Against Terran you're getting supply blocked, as the meme goes: You must construct additional Pylons.  I think this can be improved by setting an ""internal cost/reward"" on units and buildings. The most straight forward example is setting high rewards for probes mining the mineral patch up to 16, lower rewards up to 24, and no rewards at all past 24. A Starcraft player with a good basic macro keeps his resources low, so you could have some kind of a quota for production structures, something like 1 for gateway, 1.5 for stargates and robos, given fully saturated bases you could support production of 3.5-4 value production structures per base. Similar quota you can use for upgrades for example.  Something more advanced is attempting to parse build orders into SC2 commands, but that can get complicated quickly if the enemy attacks quickly.  Also I'm wondering how something like Blink Stalker micro can be incorporated here...",True

@snowpython,2022-03-09T05:54:45Z,0,"I would suggest watching WinterSC2 He's a technical casters who primarily plays starcraft, but also has talked with deva before. Mostly with other rts games. He would be a good resource for h Game timings and how to play the game.  If not working with him I will suggest his build order for new protoss, Sc2 is typically timed by supply in early game so: 14 pylon, 16 gateway, 20 cyber core, 21 pylon  After that you go into tech etc",True

@Taffaz,2022-03-08T10:43:43Z,0,The second can afford when building void rays is needed if you have more than one Stargate. You get into that loop if you can afford one but then when you get to the second Stargate you wouldn't be able to afford another.,True

@easyBob100,2022-03-08T00:35:23Z,0,"I wonder if one could use basic logic for build order, but then use a NN to decide where to put the buildings.  That way, the network doesn't need to learn about buildings, just where the best places are for them.  That'd be more like alpha-go.",True

@uncommonsensor,2022-03-07T21:38:25Z,0,Awesome. I've been wanting to go back and work on some Total Annihilation AI. I suppose I could use some python,True
@ILoveCunnilingus,2022-03-07T21:11:45Z,0,"Pylons provide 3 things. Allows creation/warping of buildings within its ""matrix"" the circle, provides power to those buildings, and supply to produce more units. One strategy for enemies is to focus a pylon powering many buildings. Take the pylon out, the surrounding buildings become unpowered. Only limit is how many buildings you can fit within the Pylon's circle.   I did see something like self.supply_worker . I don't know what the function does but if it returns the total workers then could incorporate something like with owning 1 nexus stop training at 22 workers/probes.  And the game is running like ~10 times the speed",True
@SamuraiHunter,2022-03-07T20:57:55Z,34,"the call to self.supply_left calculates self.supply_cap - self.supply_used so it is the same whether you call it or calculate yourself.  and if I may give a few suggestions: 1) instead of building pylons while we have less then 5 change it to build a pylon everytime we have less then a certain amount of supply left (I found that 10 times the number of nexuses you have is a good start). as such you will not waste too many minerals in the start of the game and instead of building voidrays untill you are in 55 supply you will be able to get up to 200 supply (more voidrays more fun!) 2) don't build a forge and cannons at the start of the game, getting more voidrays (or any other unit) faster is better in most cases. you should only build cannons if your opponent is very aggressive or if you don't have enough actions per minute to defend all your bases (which shouldn't be a problem for the AI). 3) limit the number of probes you have to 22 per nexus you own (16 on minerals + 3 on each gas) is considered to be the standard.  I really enjoyed the video sentdex! thank you very much!",True
@DHAtEnclaveForensics,2022-03-07T19:03:56Z,4,"I do enjoy your series, but I have to wonder if you plan to connect this back to ML or AI at some point.  Honestly, so far what you're creating are what are usually called ""bots.""  It really isn't ML unless the algorithm improves based on past experience.  I suppose you could make the argument that any bot is AI, though... but it's not what people expect to see these days.",True
@dazryan3463,2022-03-07T18:08:13Z,1,I find this subject fascinating but do not have access to the hardware required. Might be worth relaunching the series when hardware shortages have become a thing of the past,True
@hashwarden5218,2022-03-07T17:41:07Z,0,"Thank you for reviving this series! I've been really interested in learning reinforcement models ever since I read the Nature paper on Alphastar discussing multi-agent reinforcement learning with LSTMs, transformers, MLP, pointer network, value network, policy network and self-play. I hope you are able to explore these concepts in this series and try to recreate the Alphastar agent. Also at 11mins, you asked what was happening with the building. Yes, the Cybernetics Core and the Photon Cannon were out of the range of the pylon and the buildings were de-powered. You need to build a pylon where the field matrix completely covers the buildings.",True
@magsol13,2022-03-07T17:28:03Z,0,"Terran’s base unit, the Marine (50 minerals), can fire at both air & ground, hence why they’re so tough. 15 marines will chew through 3 void rays for a fraction of the time and cost. Also, pylons self-power: they don’t have to be within the “matrix” of another pylon. That’s the basis for the “cannon rush”: send a drone just outside the enemy base, build a pylon, then cannons 🤪 also: Protoss drones are unique in that all they’re needed for is *initiating* the construction of a building, after that it builds itself. So in practice most players only have 1 dedicated drone per base area for warping in new buildings.",True
