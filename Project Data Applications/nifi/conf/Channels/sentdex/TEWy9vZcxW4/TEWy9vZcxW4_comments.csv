@RentnersWerkstatt,2024-05-13T10:59:27Z,0,"Dude!!! I am on video 4 so far. Thus far you are about 99 out of 100 fantastic. Here is what is missing from my perspective of not knowing what or how to build a NN. Your video series starts out with an expectation of programming in some language and that is totally fair, else none would understand anything at all. I do feel that one would need to have a basic understanding of Python mostly because of terminology. To know that a list is an array and batch is simply an array of arrays and such is useful especially if the student's background is in PHP or Javascript. Now here is where I start exploring outside of your videos.... Your start with the raw code of this NN is also fantastic. What I recommend is a bit more basis explanation. For example what is a layer? Why is a layer? You can mention the function or purpose of weights and also mention that they are or can be random as the ""learning"" part will be the machine testing different weights and biases in itself. You start out also comparing the code to a NN diagram and that is MOST AWESOME, thank you. You also start out with building this code around a scenario of mainboard/case/rack sensors used to determine the failure of a server. So you basically should have a final result of yes/no it will fail. The same as your cat/dog. But one may assume that humanly we are inputing only pics of cat or dog, thus your output can be a binary of isCat and that is all that is required. I would like to see more in line analogies to your sensor scenario as it is a massive benefit to understanding each element of the NN.  That is my only advice. Thus far I love it. When these explanations are missing, it is easy to go outside to another resource and ask what a ""layer"" is and why or what it does, but from a product perspective ""your video series"" your intent should be to keep me from venturing out as with a bounce rate, you do not want to lose my attention.",True

And without having seen the results from the dot product with the vector of shape (4, ), I would not have understood that np.dot(weights, inputs.T) is incorrect.

I understand that the inverse of this, transposing the inputs and putting that second would not return the intended results. Both are mathematically correct, but return different results.

@kanskejonasidag1,2020-07-29T17:45:59Z,0,"Can someone help me a bit here, I'm really struggling with one part. At 18:14, I get different values in the last column in the output matrix. I.e, my last neuron shows the wrong output for all three batches.  Now, I've double and triple-checked all the the weights and biases, the first inputs etc. I noticed it happens in the second layer, because the output from layer 1 is correct according to the video. I have tried multiple times to do the matrix multiplication (dot product) by hand, and then adding the bias, and I always get the same values. My last neuron outputs, in batches 1 to 3, the following: -2.474, -5.112, -0.735.   Notice how it's the decimals that differ, which could indicate some sort of rounding error, but the first layer's output is spot on with the videos output, so I dunno... grateful for any help.",True

@evripidistzionas6740,2020-05-17T09:18:33Z,0,"To be able to understand better the dot product of matrices, I will tell you a tip. You have a matrix of size (rows X columns) = [a X b] and you have to multiply it with another matrix of size(shape)  (rows X columns) = [c X d].   To be able to execute the dot product of those two matrices , b always has to be equal to c (b=c) or it cannot be executed. Furthermore the dot product will always be the size of [a X d].     So for example if i have a matrix of size  A = [3 x 4] dot B = [4 x 100] it can be executed and have a size(shape) of [ 3 x 1000] .   If i have a matrix of size A = [3 x 1000] dot B = [4 x 1000] cannot be executed because 1000 is unequal to 4.   But if the transpose the B matrix then it's size(shape) becomes Btranspose = [1000 x 4] and then we have the A = [3 x 1000] dot B^T = [1000 x 4] with our final product being the size of [3x4]",True

@AladdinPersson,2020-05-01T17:18:43Z,0,From my understanding not using the entire training set as your batchsize is primarily because of computational reasons. Having a smaller batchsize allows for more update steps relatively to using the entire training set. I don't think you're necessarily wrong in that using a batch size does add some randomness and can reduce overfitting but I don't believe that's the primary reason,True
@daniel4178,2020-05-01T17:11:06Z,0,Is there a reason for why we initialize weights that specifically follow a normal distribution?  Or could we for example generate weights from a uniform distribution function between -0.1 and 0.1?,True
