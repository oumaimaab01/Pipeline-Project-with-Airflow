@nissanfanatic240,2018-02-09T20:45:25Z,0,"Really wish they had made the diffs stronger. That was my only complaint while I had one. I think I launched mine two or three times the whole time I owned it due to the fear of blowing it up.  Also, not sure if you are using any datalogging apps, but the Racelogic loggers are pretty nice. I use a PerformanceBox with the CircuitTools software for analysis. I'd bet it already has the start/finish set for MSR.",True

@ISpinUWin,2017-11-19T22:46:14Z,1,I don’t understand sh*t about your programming stuff but what I do understand is that it sux for parts to break - you got lucky because in that corner in my car or if you are driving at the limit anything but full throttle weight transfer through that corner will result in a spin.   Also that it appears damage was contained and no oil on track (another chance at a spin). Hope all is ok now and it’s good you were safely able to pull to the side.,True

Do your research and start to do some actual coding. You’ll learn faster than being a gimme. Don’t take Harrison’s good work for granted. Show some gratitude and respect. This is his channel. He can share whatever he likes!,True
