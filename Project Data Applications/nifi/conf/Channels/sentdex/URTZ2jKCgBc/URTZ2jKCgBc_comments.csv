For being a tutorial, it's not enough to just open a webpage and say ""very easy"". Some of these packages depends on Visual Studio, that's not mentioned. Visual Studio doesn't cooperate with Python at all, just out of the box. The version of Python that VS want's to cooperate with, is a totally different version than the one I alreaddy spent hours to download, install and debug with all addiotional packages. This went from ""very easy"" to ""a headache taking most of my sunday, and still not working"". I think, for a tutorial, picking the right versions of software and installing them correctly should be better covered.",True
