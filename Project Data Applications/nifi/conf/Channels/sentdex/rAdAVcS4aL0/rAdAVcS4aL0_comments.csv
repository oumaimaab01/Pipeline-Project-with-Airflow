SBIN(State Bank of India) is such example where I found anomalies in the Adjusted Close. for 2015. 2. keystats folder is inconsistent. For few stocks there are more than 3 entries per year and for few there are either one or two. Why not we have same number of files for each stock? 3.how often the stock fundamentals change yearly.. 4. The features(stock fundamentals) available , how would they help improving the accuracy or better prediction.?",True
