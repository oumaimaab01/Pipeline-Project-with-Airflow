They are really helping the other stuff I'm learning stick!  I have a bunch of ideas on further improvements but currently spending time just refining strategy and learning new things I can do with python.  Anyway, if you hit any walls in progress in the game don't hesitate to hit up your community! ...unless you're currently training an NN to make something no one understands that beats everything lol.",True

@pizzafoot1966,2018-01-03T01:49:15Z,0,"Basically a copy of my reply to Graziano Mirata, just more in depth-  Heyyo, are there any API reference for any of these coding languages? Python for myself, but I just want to know what things sent to the Hallite engine do what things.   Will adding _""d {} {} list(beaf_and_cheese)"" + whatnot.whatever()_ to the command queue actually do something?  (Obviously not lol, but what _WILL_ do something???)  For example I still don't know what things like this mean.      ""t {} {} {}"".format(self.id, int(magnitude), round(angle))  This is the thrust()'s return value in the Ship class. Just what does it mean and do?  I was trying to create my own _getShipById()_ function, but ended up just butchering a part of the _planets_ class from the starter bot's entities file to make it work instead.   I kept looking on the Hallite challenge site for API references (in python specifically), trying to figure out what commands added to the command queue do what different things, but I had no luck.",True
