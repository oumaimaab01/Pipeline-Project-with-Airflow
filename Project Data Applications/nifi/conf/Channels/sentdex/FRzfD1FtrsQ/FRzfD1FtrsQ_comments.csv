@katyaarnold,2020-04-02T19:17:00Z,0,"Hey, I am trying to go over the tutorial for the lecture at (https://pythonprogramming.net/rolling-statistics-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/), and  having really hard time reproducing the code - even before the  actual part of the rolling statistics starts. Quandl import (with capital Q) - doesn't work for python3.7. The function HPI_Benchmark() doesn't work for me. Neither does grab_initial_state_data(). Also, grab_initial_state_data() is never called,  and I couldn't understand where the  fiddy_states3.pickle  file comes from. Is there an updated tutorial? Thanks in advance!",True

HPI_data['TX12STD'] = HPI_data['TX'].rolling(12).std() this returns only NaN values for all the rows (not just the first 11 rows) in Python 3.7.0, pandas 0.23.3  I found a workaround from google which solved the issue but I am afraid I don't understand why or how it works.

@m3equals333,2017-06-30T14:56:14Z,1,"Along the lines of what +EKV alluded to below, see below for the new rolling correlation syntax and a slight augmentation to the correlation plot code so that it unstacks the index (the new syntax apparently brings back correlation matrices for each index item (i.e.date), so the index retains a new hierarchical level in the form of the correlation pair).  New to all this, so please correct me if I misunderstood something.

@RealMcDudu,2016-05-11T11:18:19Z,1,"Nice vid.   A comment about the investment ""tip"" you gave in the end: A correlation of -1 (or close) is not necessarily a good time to buy a house (or a stock, or any asset). It's probably is when we're talking about an upward line and a general raise in housing prices. But if, say, the market goes down - and you have one state which is still going up, a correlation of -1 will serve more of an indication that the game is over for that state and it will soon follow the rest of the pack.  You can more or less see it in the data you have here - around 85-86, the correlation between Alaska and Texas almost reaches -1, but then soon enough it goes back to 1. Was that a good time to buy? No - Alaska went back to being correlated with Texas - and they both went down.",True
