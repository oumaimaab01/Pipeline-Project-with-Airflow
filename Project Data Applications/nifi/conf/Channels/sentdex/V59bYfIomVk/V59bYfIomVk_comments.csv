@pillarsofgaming4609,2019-01-29T03:16:01Z,3,Could you please do the derivation for the best fit line slope or possibly link to a derivation?  I'm just personally not a big fan of being explicitly told a formula is true without it's derivation.  I know the linear algebra derivation for the line of best fit but not this form.  Great video though!,True
