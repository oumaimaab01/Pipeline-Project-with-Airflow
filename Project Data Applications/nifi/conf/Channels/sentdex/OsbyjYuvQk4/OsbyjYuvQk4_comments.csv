@snoop3433,2020-08-01T11:55:51Z,0,"Great tutorial, I am building a pong game and learning from you. I have an example of a way to create a function that sends messages to the game window. Here it is:  import pygame  game_win = pygame.display.set_mode(700, 500)  def message(sentence, color, x, y, font):     sentence = font.render(sentence, True, color)     game_win.blit(sentence, [x, y])  The first parameter is any string of your choice, the second is the color, you can define a color using RGB, and then you have to put your X coordinates and Y coordinates, lastly, you will need to put a font.",True

Took several minutes to figure it why :)",True
