@teslamodel314,2021-01-05T22:00:08Z,0,"If someone interested, and if you can suggest a better implementation, I added thes lines to check if the active window is the one of the game, so the program runs only when the game windows is active. First import this ""from win32gui import GetWindowText, GetForegroundWindow"" and then I put this check inside the while loop ""if GetWindowText(GetForegroundWindow())== ""your window name here"":"" I'm sure theres a better way to do this, but this works",True
@aiden2610,2020-12-10T02:29:45Z,1,Thanks for the awesome tutorial! I used it to capture my screen and do some image recognition stuff.,True

@xinthralgaming,2019-09-11T12:04:51Z,2,"I know this is old, but I love the fact that you put in 10:45 how dumb errors can be if exceptions aren't well documented and your reaction to it. ""That's crazy...that's like the worst.."", gave me a good chuckle.",True

@TotalImmort7l,2019-06-04T07:39:48Z,29,Watching your video is like having a friend/mentor/teacher who actually makes things simple by encouraging me to perform experiment with code and come up with fantastic solutions!,True
@omarkhayyamravenhurst3982,2019-02-28T23:24:08Z,0,"You're re-allocating the mask zeros array every time you call roi(..). It should be much faster if you allocate it once (outside the function) and then just clear it using mask[: ,:] = 0 (and then you do the fillPoly etc)  Come to think of it, if your roi stays the same you only need to calc mask once",True
@etopowertwon,2018-12-02T10:38:46Z,0,"Wouldn't it be better to create mask only once and reuse it?  Right now we fill mask polygon every frame  from  the vertices, which is probably not healthy for CPU cycles.",True

@jennyvasquez335,2017-07-24T05:57:07Z,2,Hey Im doing this stuff for a different driving game.  Just curious how do you get the dimensions of the window?  Did you use some sort of tool or program?  thanks!!,True

@0xf7c8,2017-05-11T20:02:50Z,3,"Love your videos. Really great work man!! I have one suggestion. You could use more resolution for the whole video capture , and make everything smaller, so we can see everything at all time, and you don't have to move stuff around. I think code it's more than readable enough if you reduce it's size. It would be more comfortable to watch.",True

@windmill1965,2017-04-11T08:35:54Z,5,In process_img you first process the entire image and then you throw away the part you're not interested in.
