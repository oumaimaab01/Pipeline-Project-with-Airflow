@andrewschatz3949,2018-06-21T06:19:34Z,2,"Hey man.  This is amazing and I've subscribed to your channel.  I've got two questions for you though about this video.  1. Why are you using lists for your ""if x in y"" lines?  Why are you not using sets if you're continually running this operation?  2. One of your operations looks like it has a bug (I could be wrong though).  Looking at the code that you linked to your github, lines 57-59 look like they would always return False.  In line 57, you're creating a list with a length of 2.  Then you're saying ""if this list of length 2 is not in this other list, append a list with length 3"".  Wouldn't that statement always return True and you would always be appending to the list?  More specifically, 'junk' only has 2 elements in it but user_trashy_urls a list that contains lists that all have 3 elements.  Could you please let me know what you think?  Thank you.",True
