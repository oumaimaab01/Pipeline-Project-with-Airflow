@uSMELLSOGOOD,2015-07-09T01:11:36Z,1,"Is there any chance that you can kick up this series again (or reference me to a video that might be able to help me out)? I'm very curious how to parallel process a single script and assign multiple jobs to different nodes through AWS. I'm looking to have a master node, which will assign jobs to different worker nodes and pass additional jobs as the nodes become idle (after completing the job). I'd like to be able to store the output to a database through the virtual network and then extract the data and run another set of parallel processing scripts before saving again to the database. Please please please consider, it seems like this tutorial was just getting started!!",True
