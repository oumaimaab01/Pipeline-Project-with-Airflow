@martinleong6385,2018-07-22T07:27:33Z,0,"Hi there.  Thanks for sharing your insights on TF and TFJS. Couple of questions I have below. Hope you can help to clarify:  1. When adding layers to a model, what is the factor that results in the number of layers used, as well as number of input shapes to use between each layer? For instance, for tut #4, a total of 6 inputs are applied to the input layer.  model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=6)) #for subsequent layers, the inputs will be taken care of  2. The  4 tutorials switches between letting TF decide on the type of neural network used, vs the explicit use of 'relu' / 'sigmoid'. How does one decide when it is best t o let TF make the call on the appropriate type of NN to use.  Look forward to your feedback.",True
@michaelkhan3,2018-07-13T16:51:16Z,0,Here is what i did to use my own model:  I used a nodejs package that easily allows you to host a folder in your computer in a localhost server. https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server  once you have it installed you just need to go the folder where you have all your files in the terminal and run the 'static-server' command. Then just change the loadModel line to use your local server E.g. model =  await tf.loadModel('http://localhost:9080/tfjsmodel/model.json');   You should then be able to hit your server on http://localhost:9080/pongai.html,True

@robertaradi9994,2018-06-25T12:42:20Z,4,Firefox and Edge both allow you to make cross origin requests for local files. Chrome doesn't,True
@hyphenmusic8931,2018-06-24T18:05:18Z,1,"Hey Sentdex, the way you'd tackle the problem with loading the model is by using local server. I use *webpack-dev-server* and *webpack* to bundle js code (tensorflow and main.js) into single file and load through the index.html by accessing *localhost:8080/index.html* . Thus the model is available to the script from *localhost:8080/model.json* .  Btw: Love your work. If you struggle with js in future while working on new series or in general, I encourage you to ask me at *hyphen.wrex@**gmail.com*",True
@Alex4n3r,2018-06-24T12:20:25Z,0,"I think Keras disables dropout for testing automatically. But does tfjs do the same? Better set K.set_learning_phase(0) before exporting, right? I think you can also add a hash check for external resources: buzzword ""Subresource Integrity"".",True

@pafnutiytheartist,2018-06-18T17:57:53Z,0,"A better way to avoid cross-origin problems would be to set up a local server like wamp/xamp. It's nor so much a TensorFlow.js limitation, rather a browser security limitation.",True
@milaandahiya,2018-06-18T17:38:22Z,1,"I love the shark mug and the tutorials, keep up the great work!  Edit: why did you name the model Keras-64x2 instead of Keras-128?",True
@vincevannoort8115,2018-06-18T16:59:05Z,1,"Hey Sentdex,  I wanted to elaborate on the issue you were dealing with not being able to load the model.json locally. The issue is that it is a browser safety feature, it protects you from sites just being able to read any file from your computer.  An easy fix would be to just run a simple web server with python ('python3 -m http.server') or by an extension for sublime text 3 or visual studio code. If you do this, everyone should be able to reference the file locally with just 'model = await tf.loadModel('model.json');'.After setting up the webserver, you should no longer have that problem.  If you need futher explanation, just write me a message.",True

,2018-06-17T20:02:43Z,5,"As of the problem with hosting the model separately: you are serving the script over *'file://'* (clicking the index.html file and 'running it with a browser') protocol instead of *'http://'* .   It won't work as *'file://'* is not a *HyperlinkedTextTransferProtocol* , hyperlinked being important part here :D. A handy trick using *python* to quickly serve static content is, using your terminal, going to the directory of a *index.html* and running:  # this is in your linux shell or windows CMD $ python -m http.server 8080  where *8080* is the port. Then you can specify a relative path to your *.json* file, no need to use any external hosting.",True
