@RufusVidS,2020-11-26T05:06:43Z,0,"These videos are terrific.  I'm glad I found them and am very close to joining.  Only a couple comments about this video:   1.  Definitely don't like the ""magic number"" 40 for the enter key.     2.  when you added the resizing adjustments and copied code to update_chat_history_layout, you should have modified the original code to call the new function (so future changes are in only one place)  3. Using Clock.schedule_once() instead of a direct call allows all the kivy events to be processed before the call is made, because events need to be processed so state is updated.   Keep up the good work, and love the mugs!",True
