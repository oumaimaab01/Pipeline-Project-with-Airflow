@cryptoeraser5439,2020-05-25T17:23:50Z,0,"This is an amazing concept and thank you for the time and effort. I have two questions: (1) I have seen your other series about Machine Learning. The idea is that we somehow off-load the similarity detection to something like scikit-learn (SVM etc.)? Is that correct (or maybe even Tensorflow)?  (2) Is the logic behind this series, that we run and store the training and the outcome (just like you did) but then run only the leading 30 points (the edge) of our freshly acquired data against those patterns? Right now, we are using the same price line to extract the patterns and then search within the same price-line (although with an offset) to find matches, isn't that a bit misleading?",True
@malcolmswaine4660,2020-05-25T01:00:45Z,1,"Probably the most useful Algo Trading series I've ever seen.

@ryanblais4548,2019-06-21T13:34:14Z,0,"Too bad there wasn't a way to sort of convert news articles into trading data and then set up an algorithm to predict market values that way. For instance, last night gold went up to over 1400, I think because of a devaluation of the US dollar or something like that. How that could be converted to numbers, I have no idea.",True
@Yewbzee,2019-05-19T18:50:05Z,1,A great series of videos thanks for posting them and giving us the benefit of your knowledge.  As a fairly successful trader myself I would like to point out that your statistics on the percentage of traders loosing are widely documented however the main reason for traders loosing is their lack of money management system and generally not the initial prediction system.  I note in one of the previous videos you where you were back testing you were obtaining an average prediction success over 70%. That is a hugely successful system if combined with a planned money management system.,True

@andresfukazawa,2018-06-04T02:08:57Z,0,"Thanks for creating these videos.  I'm glad I sat though all 19 of them.  The most important message though was on the very last part of the last video.  I'm guessing many people might find their way to this series of 19 videos thinking of doing some kind of automated stock or forex trading.  But what you said near the end of this 19th video in regards to the chances of actually being able to sit, relax, let the machine do all the hard work for you, etc is very important and not to be taken lightly.",True
@ainetable,2017-09-27T20:52:14Z,0,Thanks for great tutorial! I want to add limit of sim > 50 like shown in this video and have a question. What is the reason of adding [:-5] to for eachPattern in patternAr: ? In earlier version it wasn't here..,True

@taylerallen7841,2017-06-01T18:46:28Z,0,You can post new videos but can't respond to your comments?,True
@taylerallen7841,2017-05-21T18:58:25Z,0,"Hey I've got a technical question.  So I see that each pattern is based off percentChange, which makes sense, and the avgOutcome is the average of 20-30 points in the future (20-30 points ahead of the last point in the pattern), which also makes sense. But why is futureOutcome the percentChange of the currentPoint and the avgOutcome?  If the futureOutcome is the percentChange of the currentPoint and the aveOutcome, isnt it just a measure of how much it moved and not its actual position? And if patForRec[29] is the last percentChange in the current pattern, isnt it just a measure of movement from the first pattern point and the last pattern point? So why would you determine a rise or drop by comparing if futureOutcome is > or < patForRec[29]? This is assuming rise or drop means profit or loss.  Assuming the we would theoretically want to buy at or somewhere right after the currentPoint and sell somewhere in the outcomeRange, wouldnt profit or loss be determined by comparing is futureOutcome is > or < 0?",True

@archdavid,2015-12-04T20:48:20Z,0,"Thanks for this series! I find this algorithm extremely cool, I had allot of fun going through it with your videos. I have a very naive question though :) since your algorithm seems to be pretty good at guessing, why wouldn't this work in real trading?",True
@kuansun3185,2015-10-14T00:32:55Z,0,"Harrison， I just have some problem about the measurement of similarity, where you use ""100.00 - abs(percentChange(eachPattern[i], patForRec[i]))"", usually eachPattern[i], patForRec[i] are numbers close  to 0, then the item on the denominator may bring problems, so I suppose another measurement may be more appropriate for this problem? something like knn method might perform better?",True
@gaslight0513,2015-10-01T20:00:45Z,0,"Also another problem I ran into when modifying the code. As toWhat moves within 30 of dataLength, the realOutcomeRange will be taking values beyond the data length. Ex: dataLength = 100 and toWhat = 80. realOutcomeRange = avgLine[80+20:80+30]. So i simply used while toWhat < (dataLength - 30). But again, YMMV",True
@gaslight0513,2015-10-01T19:55:48Z,1,I think one problem is that when trying to find similar patterns you will iterate through the exact same pattern (and ones around it) in the entire pattern list. This is why some patterns will have 99.9999% total similarity since we are returning .00001 for % change of zero. If requiring similarity to be < 99.99 as well accuracy is a little more than 50%. Although I modified the code to use adjusted close stock prices so YMMV.,True

@allstarmark12345,2014-04-12T23:24:06Z,0,"Thanks for the video series - it was great and I think it is a worthwhile tutorial for anyone interested in quant trading (beginner/intermediate) to review.  From a trading perspective, it would be worth seeing a few more outputs, though I completely understand it would take many more videos :)  -What is PnL through time? -What are your positions through time?  Also - there are some other trading system questions you could ask.   -What actually triggers a trade? (at time T, you may be long, but T+1 could be short) -When you are in a trade, and the indicator says to do something else, what do you do? (stay in current position, exit current, or completely switch position)  Obviously with tick data this can be tricky, since many of the ""historical opportunities"" carry a list of assumptions that may make live trading unprofitable...I like your recommendation to test this on 1 minute OHLC data.",True

@davicorreia942,2013-12-21T07:19:28Z,0,"Hello Harrison, Great series. I was wondering if with such large amount of data, a more statistical analysis wouldn't be a good idea, or if you do that. Expected value, standard deviation, etc. As a matter of fact, I would compare two patterns based on their correlation, rather than just the sum of their differences and use that number to calculate the expected value to give more weight to a pattern that correlates more, and less to a pattern that correlates less, rather than averaging all outcomes equally. Does that make sense?",True
