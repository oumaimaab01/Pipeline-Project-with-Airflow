@godplayers,2015-02-17T03:13:13Z,2,"Hey sentdex, I tried to do the same thing as you did with putting color = colorup and colordown for if/else cases, but my version of matplotlib had the candlestick function updated the following way: def candlestick(ax, quotes, width=0.2, colorup='k', colordown='r', alpha=1.0):     warnings.warn(_warn_str.format(fun='candlestick'), mplDeprecation)     return _candlestick(ax, quotes, width=width, colorup=colorup, colordown=colordown, alpha=alpha, ochl=True)  def _candlestick(ax, quotes, width=0.2, colorup='k', colordown='r', alpha=1.0, ochl=True):      OFFSET = width / 2.0     lines = []     patches = []    ( same code here)       return lines, patches  I tried things such as importing _candlestick instead of candlestick and updating a little of coding within the (same code here) line but they were all futile attempts.  Can you help me out?",True
@rabitale7282,2014-05-25T14:26:02Z,0,im on osx 10.9 and making the changes the 'finance.py' file is not having any impact. I also tried deleting the entire candlestick function but it still gives the black candlestick chart. I have looked for another finance.py file but cant find any. I am also using canopy. Any ideas on where the file would be?,True
