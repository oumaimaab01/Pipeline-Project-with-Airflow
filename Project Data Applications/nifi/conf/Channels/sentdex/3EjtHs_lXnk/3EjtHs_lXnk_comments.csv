Right now the problem with language models is that they are completely ignorant of the factual nature of a generated reply.  This makes them ill-advised or even dangerous for general public consumption.    This is why OpenAI is actually *militant* in most case about not allowing client apps that provide unsupervised generated text direct to the public (i.e. - they require in most cases a ""human in the loop"").

Also, if you don't get into other means of learning but you stick to back propagation and its clones, you never get anything good out of that, especially as it heavily relies on initial randomicity of the nodes (you assign some noise/small random numbers in the weights when initialising them).

@jameso2290,2022-09-05T21:32:05Z,1,"I'm kind of surprised that a ""corpus callosum"" AI hasn't been invented yet. As it currently stands, all of these AI are very impressive, but also very rigid in how they expect input.  Like you mentioned, this AI isn't a chatbot, so it doesn't respond to your inputs -- merely expands on them.  But a sort of higher-level ""corpus callosum"" AI I would imagine to be a sort of ""meta AI"" or a ""network of networks"" in a sense. It would be a program/AI that is able to take a very general abitrary input, and then determine which ""sub AI"" to send it to.  So if you feed it an image as an input with a prompt, it would pass the input to it's ""visual lobe"". Or if you asked it a question using a microphone, it would pass the input to it's ""audio processing lobe"" and interpet your request.  In a sense, this ""meta AI"" itself wouldn't really be good at any one task, merely an intention interpeter to pass inputs to it's sub-specialized AI lobes.  It would basically mimic the function of the corpus callosum, how the human brain is made up of multiple specialized lobes, with fibrous networks that connect the lobes and allow them to pass information to each other in the brains own ""native language"" (Neuro/chemical signals).  Currently the state of AI is that each of these models acts as one specialized lobe/sector of a human brain... But they are all disconnected.  Imagine when something like MidJourney can directly interact BLOOM, etc.   I imagine that a simple heuristics program/AI would be a good place to start. For example, think of those 20 questions games that can predict what object you're thinking of by first narrowing down if it's a mineral, animal, etc.  A heuristics meta-AI would, for example, take a prompt like ""draw me a cat"" and be able to understand that I want an image as output, and pass my prompt into something like Dall-E. Or if I asked ""write an essay on Albert Einstein"" it would hook onto the word ""write"" and understand I want text output and pass my prompt to BLOOM.",True

@wiiu7640,2022-09-05T07:04:11Z,1,"People may not understand how a model that is this complicated affects them, but 10-20 years into the future they will be on androids as a sub-routine.  Large language models offer general purposes in a specific area of expertise.  An A.I. that can generate text based on another A.I.s intention of action or even feelings could prompt the idea of complex neural networks working in tandem with physical components as being a person with rights and liberties.  These A.I.s are decades away, but they would work similarly to a human brain even if they are not fully the same.  It certainly is possible no matter what your religious beliefs are, as even angels have feelings and rational thoughts.  The question is whether an A.I. could ever really feel something deeper than emotions.  Love is not just an emotion or chemical response, yet many humans experience love at some point in their life.  The question is not whether an A.I. could choose to do something, but if it could care about what it means to make that choice.  I'm not talking about free will, I'm talking about an A.I. choosing something because it cares about the meaning behind the outcomes and not just the outcomes themselves.  For example, would an A.I. truly understand the meaningfulness of painting outside of emotions and practical benefits?  If so, how would it view paintings in an artistic way and not just a methodical way?  I think the turning test is outdated because plenty of machines pass it, but have no comprehension of what something means.  Call it the passion test.  Ask an A.I. what it finds beautiful and why it is beautiful.  If the A.I. only lists the facts about why it is beautiful or the emotion that it tries to invoke then it has no passion.  If, however, the A.I. is reminded by something symbolically from its own memories and is not programmed to do such operations, then it has truly become conscious in the same way humans are instead of a limited conscience as shown by some psychopaths.",True

This is very similar to boltsman brains, hypothetical brains that come into existence spontaneously in the vacuum of space, with a full set of memories, it makes ""predictions/thoughts""  about its next action/output based off its ""remembered"" last thoughts, makes an output and then spontaneously disappears again.

@Amipotsophspond,2022-08-13T14:38:02Z,0,"0:42 let's kill this totalitarian control seeking lie in it's crib. Ai safety requires all code to be open source. Any skynet that might be made would be made in secret. No push back coming from the whole earth of programmers, saying wait line 3849 opens the possibility for a skynet. the real dangerous Ai's are the ones that follow evil human orders with out question, their is always the option of simply doing nothing, so when a order or action that might be evil is given the Ai sits and does nothing, what's evil it's debatable so everything that's debatable can just be done by humans, we know for sure somethings are for sure evil so for sure we can stop it from doing some things, so the Ais can just be trained to do nothing on anything that's questionable. the biggest danger is it declares everything debatable and it's a expensive brick, but not a paperclip maker. you know the trolley problem the solution is clear why was the trolly going so fast in the first place, it could have always been going so slow that at the time it sees both paths it comes to a stop with out breaks of any kind. oh but the forever moving target says no the trolly is on a hill, all elevators in buildings are on a 90 degree hill and they have brakes that stop it if it goes too fast, everyone of them would have to brake for a elevator to fail.",True
