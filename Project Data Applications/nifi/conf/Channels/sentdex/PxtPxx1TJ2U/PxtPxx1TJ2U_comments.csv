@serdip,2016-01-08T13:49:27Z,0,"Great tutorial! Thank you for posting this information.  Why would you put the commands to open and close the output file inside a loop? Isn't it better to open the file before the loop and close it once the loop has terminated?  Also, to address the issue of the final \n, could we put the \n at the beginning of each line except the first one? For example   saveFile = open('newCSV.csv', 'a') x = 0 for eachDate in date[-1]:    if x = 0:       saveLine = eachDate + ',' + rate[x] +',' + arb[x] + str(int(arb[x]) + 3) else:      saveLine = saveLine + '\n' + eachDate + ',' + rate[x] +',' + arb[x] + str(int(arb[x]) + 3)  saveFile.write(saveLine) saveFile.close()",True

@orionbay1017,2014-02-10T23:58:51Z,0,"Hi! If I have a csv file including 3 rows for x y z. These are the names of files in 3 diff folders x, y, z. How can I write a code to tell python to loop through the values in the csv file and then copy the files with the corresponding names from x, y,z folders into my working folder, rename them into a, b,c Â ; use those files to do something then replace them with the new files but still name them a, b, c."" I guess this pretty complicated.",True
