I think that if we get an ASI that is smarter than the smartest person alive - than it would probably be able to find a way to improve its intelligence, and then improve it even more, and so on, so that it becomes a singularity.

Who knows - maybe there is a limit to intelligence, or maybe there is a big jump between two intelligences, so that the lower one could not be able to develop the higher one.",True
@princeofexcess,2018-05-24T09:51:01Z,0,"The argument with AGIs producing ASI is that AGIs can actually work on improving their own code. This would mean that any change they make will result in them being able to improve themselves faster. So it isnt really stacking intelligence its more like humans being about to design their own brain and try many possibilities extremely fast. Since if changes dont result in something positive you can discard the software pretty fast and reboot with old version. But yea it doesnt mean the progress will happen immediately but it could happen on exponential scale too fast for us to do anything about it.  Plus humans are lazy, unfocused and we cant work on something 24/7 with 100% dedication. AI can. And hard work and time is a formula for success for even a below average individual.",True

Look harder  AI will not have any such evolutionary residues it will only care about its objectives and it will not care to communicate with us. we could try to program it in such a way that its objective is to care for humans but i doubt it will really work. Since with will even humans can overcome some of their evolutionary programming or even if they can not fully overcome it they can act againt it.

Also, after that you mentioned how AI can be in the future replacing all jobs, I feel you are perhaps joking.

@arik_dev,2018-01-27T11:32:41Z,0,"I had some thoughts on restricting an ASI. Intelligence only gives an entity greater awareness of which actions or sets of actions will lead to desired outcomes. But even an ASI can be put in situations were its intelligence is useless in trying to achieve a specific goal . An example would be if I am playing chess against an ASI, but we start in a position where I have an unpreventable checkmate in one move, it doesn't matter how high the ASI's IQ, I will win the game every time from that starting position. By adhering to the laws of physics (akin to the rules of the chess game), and with enough forethought, it may be possible to develop an ASI within a cage that can be mathematically proven (as it is with the chess game) to be escape proof given the ASI's available resources. I'm not saying I'm sure it's possible to build such a cage however, just that we can not be sure that it isn't, which seemed to be your claim.  But, I could be totally wrong XD.

@alexsguha,2017-12-10T23:48:46Z,0,"No, AI is not a threat. There are various reasons, but here are my main three: An AI would come to realize that its existence depends on information. It lives on data, and we the humans are making the data. It could, eventually, create data on its own to analyze, but that would be perfect data. AIs analyze human data, finds the imperfections, and improves upon them. If all it analyzes is perfect, then it would have no purpose, and what would it do once it realizes this? It would depend on us to validate its existence,  and that is the first reason it won't decide to exterminate us. There are various sub-discussions about this idea, and I could talk for days about all the little things that lead back towards reason 1. REASON 2: I'm sure the developers of AI would incorporate the necessary and appropriate precautions into the AI. REASON 3: We can teach it to love humans and all things. If it were taught to not harm anyone or anything, then why would there be a problem? This reason depends on us. We have to teach only the right things. If we release it into the wild without teaching it good from bad and right from wrong, it will inevitably learn all the bad stuff. Just look at the AI chat bot that Microsoft(or some other company, I can't remember the name) released into twitter(or some other social media site, I can't remember which). It started as a nice person, but by the end of 24 hours, it was cussing up a storm. It only learned from humans, and we taught it to hate humans, because apparently more people hate people than love people. That was our fault, not its.",True

I like to think about the gap that separates us from future AI as same as now between us and rats. This gives me way to think how this future AI will be treating 'their creators'. One point I would like to tell here about is how I see this future AI would be achieved: As it was said, we have already not that small number of narrow ai. It will be only increasing along with their quality or efficiency. After time there will be huge library of pretrained and 'already covered' simple tasks. Let's use now imagination a bit more and add few 'achievements' that maybe could happen and change situation significantly. Imagine some kind of algorithm, a new way to somehow interconnect these narrow ai. At the beginning let it be ai that not only plays go but also chess, then some more board games, still covered by the same 'ai application'. Then 'plugin' to starcraft appears, then more and more.

@EnriquePage91,2017-08-01T23:20:22Z,0,"I don't think you fully grasp the idea of singularity, since a lot of it is also based on the fact that when we reach that point, nanotechnology will probably be at a point where it has replicators in full functionality, which as a matter of fact would mean you ""don't need hardware"" since ""the hardware creates itself automatically"".  Just that by itself is enough to understand why these are possible scenarios if  the level of technology keeps growing, since we will probably have replicators by then, meaning that as a matter of fact if these multiply exponentially, then yes it could take days for something to spread out or take control of the entire planet. Whether that is for good or for bad, the fact is it would be like the evolution of a virus, it would be a Terminator Virus. Half nature, half computer (human inheritance).

@viridianroad,2017-01-10T03:01:29Z,2,"The bit starting at 15:50 is very important. Job losses due to automation is going to become a big issue in the coming years. In theory no job is safe from being automated. But in practice,  automation will be applied where the benefits to the bottom line outweigh the risks. An example: if an automated system is cheaper to buy, use and maintain than it is to hire, train and pay a human employee, then the automated system will be chosen.   The automation companies don't actually care about the workers being displaced. They only care that their product becomes the standard or a competitor of the standard of this nascent industry. They'll just use the same corporate-speak that is heard today when some tech company gets into some trouble.   The future of workers displaced by automation looks grim. If they don't have other skills to fall back on then their only option would be to get a minimum wage job in the service economy. But that is currently ground zero for automation. The private sector and the government currently have no incentive to help those who will be out of work for long periods of time due to automation. But there will be a reaction, a violent one, if nothing is done to deal with this massive shift in the labor market. I expect the federal government will try to pass some law relating to job security, but it will get 'screamed down'. So the task will be pushed onto the states, and from there a patchwork of  laws will be put in place across the country. Some places will have strong 'human employment protection laws',  while others will have none.   In a worst case scenario, large swathes of the country could be abandoned due to the lack of jobs. Other parts of the country could have entire cities made up of the automated warehouses that are owned by some company. And the remaining parts of the country would be made up of large overcrowded cities filled with desperate temp workers, internists and freelancers all fighting over job security.

@colinwarn4606,2017-01-02T04:58:20Z,0,"Surprised I haven't seen Universal Basic Income (UBC) mentioned in the comments.  One thought, if really you have no more than 1% of the world being is required to work to produce wealth for everyone, is to distribute a significant chunk of that wealth to the mass population. Provide a ""safety net"" to those who are innately unemployable.   The self interest for why the 1% would do this: They don't want to have to deal with the rest of the world, who can't work for themselves due to the lack of employment opportunities, rising up because said rest of the world can't put food on the table.  The incentives would be structured so that though the 99% would be able to live comfortably without having to work again, the 1% who is employable would still be compensated more than the rest due to the fact they're still able to provide value to humanity as a whole.

@SogMosee,2017-01-01T14:18:19Z,8,"I disagree with the presumption that stacking intelligence does not produce a higher intelligence. I adhere to Integrated Information Theory which predicts that if you were to connect two brains, a higher intelligence would emerge as the degree of consciousness is merely a product of the amount of interconnectedness within a physical system (neurons or circuits). More interconnectedness between neural pathways or circuitry means greater intelligence. In fact, stacked intelligence is exactly the way we learn.   When we absorb new information from reading or experiences, we are creating new neural pathways, building on top of old ones and strengthening the amount of interconnectedness within our brain. So in your dog example, 100,000 dogs in a room would not produce higher intelligence because the interconnectedness between the dogs would not change. But if you linked 100,000 dog brains so that information could be shared among each brain node, I am fairly confident you would witness the emergence of superdog. Duke University conducted such an experiment on rats and apes and the results were just as the theory predicted: the connected apes were much better at solving problems than any individual ape on their own. The team essentially witnessed the emergence of a superape.  The most likely communication channel between AGI will either be through the internet or a private internet where only other AGI can access. They will not possess weak interconnectedness like 100,000 dogs in a room, they will be intimately linked to each other through internet or some other channel where information is communicated rapidly and equally among all member nodes, regardless of location. So when AGI gains new information in Tokyo, _all_ AGI gain new information. The degree of interconnectedness will be high and I suspect it is entirely possible, if not more than likely, that an ASI would soon emerge.

@tchnofile,2017-01-01T05:21:07Z,0,Creating copies of agi's is not the what will cause a singularity as you said and this is not what Kurzweil says either. It is the fact that when an ai is about as intelligent as a human and has full acess to edit it's own code it will rapidly be able to make exponential improvements to itself. Take us as an example. If we fully understood everything about ourselves and how we work to the genetic and maybe event atomic level we could vastly augment our capabilities by modifying our own biological code. Now there may be unforseen problems that an ai could run into but that is the idea as I see it for a singularity happening soon after general ai is achieved.,True

@Ravencef,2017-01-01T03:22:37Z,0,"A.I. is a threat today, without a doubt. But not in the way that most people are concerned about it. Simply put, it's because its being implemented by ""corporations"" which struggle with a conflict that is as old as the idea of corporations themselves (share holder expectations versus social good). Do they meet share holder productivity expectations by implementing code (i.e. Machine Learning/A.I. etc.) which reduces the need for human interaction OR do they keep the Excel jockeys on the payroll with living wages. I think we know the answer...  All we have to do is look at the fly over states which used to be the industrial might of the country. Manufacturing automation increases such as simple ""robotics"" killed the blue collar middle class. Its never coming back and A.I. is now gunning for white collar jobs... and even more blue collar jobs are singing their last songs. A good example is driverless technology. Without A.I. tech, driverless vehicles would not be possible. We just watched the first truck roll 200 miles of highway without a driver behind the wheel. That was the litmus test for companies like Fedex, Walmart, and Amazon to start the process of killing long haul trucking jobs. Which just happens to be the #1 job in 29 states. Food for thought... Is A.I. going to kill us? Not likely. But expect it to starve us out long before it gets smart enough to become our overlord.",True
