@BrandonJacobson,2020-06-17T00:00:58Z,0,I don't know if you still see these comments on old videos.  I plotted the S&P 500 over the Russell 2000 on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis of course.  Is there a way to change the Y-axis while the program is active?  What if I want to plot the S&P 500 over the treasury yield curve?  Can matplotlib do that or would I have to use Tkinter and then open and close matplotlib graphs?,True

@dane2565,2019-09-01T00:40:24Z,0,People certainly care about the actual volume numbers when performing VWAP calculations :). This would be super nice with an overlayed VWAP curve which would marry the price and volume data,True
