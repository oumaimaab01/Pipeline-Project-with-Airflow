@bairfreedom,2018-04-30T01:43:13Z,0,"Ok, I did MUCH less to get my buttons to work.  I did not draw buttons using the pydraw function. I used paint and imported the images with their function already painted on. I also skipped the ""def ""button"" business. Instead, after defining the measurements of where the buttons were,  I put in an ""if"" command under the button paremeters. So instead of saying ""Nuclear Missles launched"" I told it to ""game_loop"" on the start and pygame.quit quit() on the exit.  See below:           mouse = pygame.mouse.get_pos()         click = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()         #print(mouse)         #print(click)          if 250+130 > mouse[0] > 210 and 500+50 > mouse [1] > 450:             gamedisplay.blit(startbutton2, (214, 450, 100, 50))             if click[0]==1:                 game_loop()         else:             gamedisplay.blit(startbutton, (214, 450, 100, 50))         if 550+132 > mouse[0] > 500 and 515+50 > mouse[1] > 450:             gamedisplay.blit(exitbutton,  (500, 450, 100, 50))             if click[0]==1:                 pygame.quit()                 quit()         else:             gamedisplay.blit(exitbutton2, (500, 450, 100, 50))           pygame.display.update()",True
