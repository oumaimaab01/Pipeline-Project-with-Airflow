@williamwaddel5780,2018-08-09T05:53:41Z,4,"Sentdex; I know that this video is 4 years old, but I noticed that the wget link doesn't exist anymore. I was wondering if you could give me/us a newer link, preferably still for mpi4py? The best I could find on my own were other mpi's for python, but I would much prefer to use the one you showed in this series. Thanks!",True

@AbisZmit21,2016-05-03T01:21:50Z,1,"hey, I dont know exactly went wrong but the helloworld.py is not working. could be the reason that my ""home/pi/.profile"" flie is empty and if i type ""which mpiexec"" it shows ""/usr/bin/mpiexec"" and not the on in your video? I konw this video is kind of old but it would be nice if you could help me.",True
@hyunhokim4939,2015-03-26T03:08:23Z,0,"when i run hellowordl.py, the python script in the cluster's home folder is executed at not master but node cluster. But, on your case the script in the ~/mpi4py/mpi4py-1.3/demo is executed though you didn't set any path of application. Can I set the application path on the slave node?  My environment is ubuntu 14.04.",True
@jcasaubon,2014-11-07T03:06:04Z,0,How do the nodes keep their IPs? Aren't they potentially renewing into new addresses?. I'm afraid I'll have to rework my machinefile.   Thanks!,True
