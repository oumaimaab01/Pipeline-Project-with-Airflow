I have tried install the pip install lxml but unable to install it. It complains about unable to find vcvarsall.bat. To resolve i followed installing this https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2016/04/11/unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat/ post and install visual c++ build tools 2015 and reinstalled the lxml but it gives some other following error now.   cl : Command line warning D9025 : overriding '/W3' with '/w' lxml.etree.c src\lxml\includes\etree_defs.h(14): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'libxml/xmlversion.h': No such file or directory Compile failed: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\BIN\\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2 creating Users creating Users\pramodku creating Users\pramodku\AppData creating Users\pramodku\AppData\Local creating Users\pramodku\AppData\Local\Temp C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\BIN\cl.exe /c /nologo /Ox /W3 /GL /DNDEBUG /MD -I/usr/include/libxml2 ""-IC:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Stu ogram Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\include\10.0.10240.0\ucrt"" ""-IC:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\include\shared"" ""-IC:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\include\ \Windows Kits\8.1\include\winrt"" /TcC:\Users\pramodku\AppData\Local\Temp\xmlXPathInit1il_ye6p.c /FoUsers\pramodku\AppData\Local\Temp\xmlXPathInit1il_ye6p.obj xmlXPathInit1il_ye6p.c C:\Users\pramodku\AppData\Local\Temp\xmlXPathInit1il_ye6p.c(1): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'libxml/xpath.h': No such file or directory ********************************************************************************* Could not find function xmlCheckVersion in library libxml2.

@charmisuk,2016-04-15T04:15:46Z,30,"for those who see ValueError: columns overlap but no suffix specified, I solved it by changing 'Value' into str(abbv). So the exact code is :  df = Quandl.get(query, authtoken=api_key) df.rename(columns={'Value':str(abbv)}, inplace=True) This renames the column 'Value' to each abbv string. Join will work this way",True

@preferential94,2015-10-07T07:08:22Z,0,"Hi sentdex, Thanks for the tutorial so far! I just had one minor concern I wanted to cross-check with you. When following your code (but using my old code from part 4), I end up with 486 rows of data while you only have 462 rows. Before you released this vid, I also experimented with uploading to CSV's to practice merging/joining the data myself and that method also ended up with 486 rows. Is there a reason for the discrepancy? Maybe some of my data has been duplicated? My first data pointed is dated 1975-01-31, and my latest is dated 2015-06-30.",True
