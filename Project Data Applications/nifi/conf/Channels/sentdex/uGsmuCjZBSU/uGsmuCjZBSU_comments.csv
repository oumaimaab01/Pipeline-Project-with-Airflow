I've watched your tutorials 3 times now and I'm finally getting rolling on my website. I'm having a problem I don't know how to solve though... My index opens my home.html page which is perfect, but now that I've added my watch.html page like so:  ""from django.conf.urls import url from . import views  urlpatterns = [  url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),  url(r'^watch', views.watch, name='watch'), ]""  Which opens up like it should when I got to 127.0.0.1:8000/watch. The problem I'm having is that even though my watch.html is in the same template folder as my home.html, watch.html tries to access my static folder through a weird extended path that looks like this: /watch/static/myapp/img/etc.png which doesn't exist. My header loads all images perfectly on the home page which extends header.html but won't load any images when visiting watch.html which also extends the same header.html. I'm so lost. Thank you so much for these videos! P.S. I don't want to make a new app for the watch page since it shares the same static files.",True
