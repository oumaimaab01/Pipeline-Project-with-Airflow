As an example, when you started with Linear Regression in video #2, I wanted to see a 2-d chart with points and a line through them. And would have really liked the the idea of talking about finding a line with a slope that minimized error between all points and the line. But for the first 5 videos I saw you type up code.   On top of that unfortunately using libraries like sklearn, pickle and Quandl has me feeling overwhelmed though I do feel I can wrap my head around it as someone who codes in python.

I was thinking that we can add that to the pickle by changing the code at df=quandl.get('WIKI/GOOGL')  then adding with open ('FN.pickle','wb') as q:       pickle.dump(df, q) that would mean we need to change the other pickle code later to append like with open ('FN.pickle','ab') as f: actually i dont think that would work because of loading back the pickle happens late in the code.",True

@Nezopu,2016-06-27T13:23:23Z,2,"There is an easier way to save a classifier, it includes some internal optimisation that doesn't occur when just using pickle, and it seems to be the official way now. You can do it like so:   *from sklearn.externals import joblib* *joblib.dump(clf, 'linearregression.pickle')*  On the other end, you can load your classifier like so:  *clf = joblib.load('linearregression.pickle')*",True
