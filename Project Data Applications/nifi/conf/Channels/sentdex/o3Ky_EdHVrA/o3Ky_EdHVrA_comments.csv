If we use the same approach for a truck as well we can have a distinct comparison neasure for a car and a truck's distance which also differ in screen area and detection box area size.

If you know the best way to filter out noise before applying one, you'll get surprisingly good results.  Add an image scaling layer in the net for a few different zoom levels, applying it with an appropriate overlap (1/2 largest relevant object).  If you can train these on a frame-by-frame basis for correct object detection (using obj location/width/angle logging) and pass that to a classical neural net (or SVM!) the output should be pretty great :)  Or, if you can find think of sensible contrast functions between the output of these, using CNN would be better?",True
