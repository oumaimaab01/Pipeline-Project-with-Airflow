@veronaswindall8777,2017-12-19T01:14:01Z,2,"GoLang seems so counter-intuitive in some areas. Namely in defining types for variables. In this respect, C++ has a much more straight-forward syntax. Also, I can honestly say that it's too verbose and yet cryptic. I don't know how well I'm going to adjust to GoLang. It's just so odd. . .  even if it seems like a perfect marriage between C/C++ and Python. I think Julia might be a better alternative (if compilation speed is all that matters for the transition from Python or development time for C++ users).",True
