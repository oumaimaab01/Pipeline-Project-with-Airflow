For example, if I use y = 2*x: xs = np.array([1,2,3,4,5, 6]) ys = np.array([2,4,6,8,10,12])  using the slope equation from the video gives a wrong answer, while adding the value 0 to xs and ys gives the right one.

I have also done one-hot encoding on these parameters for better prediction results so the number of columns in my data set for training is 17 excluding the prediction price column. How can I use these parameters to build a regression line? What would be the formula for m? Please point me in the right direction. Thanks!",True

@sandeeptadepalli5963,2016-07-09T01:00:27Z,0,+sentdex According to what I understood from this.
