Basically education for free. I wish I found your channel 6 months to a year earlier. I paid some online MooCs, including brilliant.com. Oh, well, that didn't end very well because I still didn't know how to use CMD line and how to start my own project from scratch.  Do you know that each of your vid comment area also becomes a mini-forum for all Sentdex fans to discuss code or debug some code if your code/syntax is kind out of date?  Another veteran coding vblogger(tech lead) suggested the best way to learn a new language such as python is to check official documentations and tutorials.  But that maybe an easy task for a skilled programmer who has a CS degree. For a newbie, it is so hard to read and understand those documentations. Nevertheless, you once taught us to check some open-source  sample code(matplotlib) and edited it to my own application. I think it was a brilliant idea.

I always had your back and I even sent you a youtube link where this guy was using your stuff.  I even got my posts deleted from Adafruit‚Äôs youtube video on their ‚ÄúAI‚Äùchip announcement.  I corrected them, that you were doing AI before anyone on youtube.    Also, I won your Linode give away, but I didn‚Äôt do anything with it, sorry LOL.
