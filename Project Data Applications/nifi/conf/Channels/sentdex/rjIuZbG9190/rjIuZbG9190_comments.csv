@moriah410,2018-08-20T08:38:34Z,0,"I seem to be having issues flashing a message; my syntax/code is almost identical to the version up on pythonprogramming.net. (Differences do not impact flashing message) Whenever I try running __init__.py in it's directory with python3, I get ""ImportError: No module named 'flask'"". Everything else works once I comment out the ""flash"" line in __init__.py, so clearly flask is installed and present. When I restart apache2 with the ""flash"" line present in __init__.py, I get a 500 error on the dashboard page; when I restart apache2 without the ""flash"" line present everything works like a charm. - What should I do? Any help would be much appreciated.",True

@omnitunes69,2016-06-04T10:04:48Z,6,"COOL TIP I just found, wanted to share for everyone:  add a nice simple JS script to the bottom of your parent or ''header'' file, which allows your flash messages to auto close after 5 seconds:    <script>  window.setTimeout(function() { $(""#flashmsg"").fadeTo(500, 0).slideUp(500, function() { $(this).remove(); }); }, 5000);  </script>  Remember to use 4 spaces instead of tab for flash('message here') in the init.py file, and note I assigned id=""flashmsg"" to the container for flash messages.  ENJOY!",True
