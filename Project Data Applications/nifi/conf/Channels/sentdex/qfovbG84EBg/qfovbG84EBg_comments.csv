@pablogomezgracia7058,2023-11-06T10:59:20Z,0,"Hello!! Thanks for the tutorial, it was really helpful and easy to follow!! I have one question regarding normalize/scale data...I want to normalize/scale the input of the neural network (the agent model), but usually in order to normalize/scale, you do it over a set of training data previously obtained. In my case, I don't have a previous training data set, this data is dinamycally obtained as the agent makes actions and moves through diferent states. Is there a way to normalize/scale data 'dinamically'?  without having a training data set? Should I generate a dataset while training the model and the normalize the data in future iterations?",True

Just a quick question: you mention the model - i.e. the neural network in this case - ouputs a touple of predicitons. In the illustration, it outputs a four-touple, and the action corresponding to the maximum value is chose.   I imagined the approach would be to pull a set of all possible actions for the agent from the environment given the current state, and to feed each of the possible actions into the model to retrieve a predicted Q-value for each action.   For example, if you want to mimic a RL chess playing agent, some states have very few possible actions, wile others have countless, that is the number of legal moves to make for the agent.
