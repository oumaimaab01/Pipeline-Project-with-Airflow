@endlessformsmostbeautiful8442,2020-03-30T14:11:04Z,0,"Anyone able to help? Using the same dataset, can i use sent_tokenize on a whole dataframe. I want to pull out precise sentences from the full_text. So I thought i could use the tokenizer, i can get it to work on one row but i can not apply it to the whole dataframe, list or csv (ive tried everthing all formats). After I seperate all the sentences I want to then run the loop function and then pull sentences with the words ""mean incubation period"" then once they have been pulled and stored re run over that list pulling out the sentences that contain the word COVID. The reason why, (I am a biologist and I spend all my days in journals) is because alot of the journals are either quoting different incubation periods for different diseases (sars) or worse, re using the incubation period to quote the already known number, this causes un even weights. I have been trying to days and re working different code i have done for other projects and trying to combine alot too. I can split the sentences for one row i just can not apply this to the whole column, the average incubation for covid is around 4.9 days, now i can get this by doing everything the long way, around 6 days, however i am still gathering outliers in the data because they are not actually mean incubation periods for the covid virus, Hope some one can help, being able to accomplish this would help me in my further phd studies as I could gather data so much quicker than by hand.

VS Code is potentially better still (depending on preferences), as it provides access to a terminal as well (though the iPython implementation is run through Jupyter and pretty janky). (2)  Re the regex stuff, no shame in googling.  There isn't a SINGLE programmer of any sort that doesn't need to google at times.  I've been a professional for over a decade and regularly need to google syntax on basic methods, etc.  Regex is a much more involved beast, and unless you use it daily I'd be amazed if you remembered syntax needed for specific applications.",True
