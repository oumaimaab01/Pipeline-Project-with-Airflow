@BrianFaure1,2017-12-12T06:04:41Z,0,"'Top' lets you decide a period of time (past 24 hours is being displayed at 5:12) and shows the posts with the highest scores over that period of time, in decreasing order. 'Hot' is, as you say, a combination of score and time where a post is ranked higher for a higher score but looses rank seemingly exponentially over time. Edit: oh I see you figured it out",True

@Hoskid,2017-08-22T07:37:42Z,0,Reddit purposely prevented access to the number of downvotes through API requests a while ago. You can estimate the number by the number of upvotes and submission.upvote_ratio. Also something that is interesting is that they recently introduced view count to submissions but you can only view this if it is your post or you are a moderator of the subreddit.,True

@b4ux1t3-tech,2017-08-17T23:49:56Z,1,"The reason you need a user-agent is simply because the HTTP headers you use to connect to reddit require a user-agent. This kind of stuff is usually abstracted away, but they probably wanted to leave it open to have different behavior based on the user-agent. For instance, maybe they have an archival bot that would access the API and save stuff, and it would have the user-agent ""Archival Bot"", so they know that that bot should be given certain permissions, or restrictions, or what have you.",True

Dude you are either a time traveller from the future coming to make my job easier or are really good at guessing my trends :D  As for the difference between hot and top, top is the max votes for a period, hot is votes and time, so hot prefers newer stuff, top just shows the highest, you can sort top by duration so top 24 hours, week, month, 3 month, year, all time.",True
