@justinsiegel2357,2018-12-01T17:34:05Z,0,"I really like the idea of premieres, it's similar to watching TV back in the day, where you knew when and where the next episode was coming, you just had to wait. It does strike me as strange that you can like or dislike a video before it has actually premiered, but as you said, it isn't a big deal.",True
@simest45,2018-10-31T10:20:41Z,0,"There's a reason I subscribe....that would be to watch the video's that are posted for those I subscribe too. I care not if there a schedule, this is not TV, that is why I don't watch TV. Annoy me with schedule and I will find a way to remove the annoyance.",True

@TheMcal9909,2018-10-30T16:19:26Z,0,My only gripe with Premier's is they show up on my subscription feed. Now this in it self is not a bad thing yet for me. As Sentdex seems to be the only person im subbed too that uses them. But if in the future more content creators start using it. I can invision a time where my subcription feed is full of premiers notifications for videos i cant watch as of yet. Once that number starts to outstrip released videos it just becomes a cluster fuck. Youtube needs to separate them somehow.,True

@JoeTheTall,2018-10-30T14:22:10Z,1,"My experience with the premier is negative, just cause phone/gadget review channels that I subbed to just kept bombarding my notifications.  I've notifications for few channels, so when a notification comes in. I know it's the content that I prioritise over others when it comes to my free time. I don't like that it's on by default, and I'm not sure that I can turn it off.",True

@sak8485,2018-10-30T10:20:39Z,1,maybe YouTube should had an option for the users whether they would like to get the notifications about premier or they would like to directly you watch the video.,True

@kebakent,2018-10-30T09:12:18Z,5,"There is a pretty easy Premiere fix:  Limit the relative time to max 10 minutes.  I don't care about videos going live at 3am in my timezone, I'm not staying up for that. 10 minutes is short enough to wait, and long enough to get a decent amount of users synchronised. There is a reason why everyone below 30 has dropped flow-tv altogether.",True
@Xackery,2018-10-30T06:43:54Z,0,"I use RSS feeds to notify me of new content (because I can't trust YouTube to even do fundamental things like tell me when videos are posted to those I subscribe to), and premiere videos come up as new content when the person posts a scheduled future one. It also nags my Subscription feed list asking me to set a reminder for the future event. I'm not on YouTube's subscription list to see what is going to be showing later, and if they can't figure out a way to elegantly redesign this, I'll just end up writing a filter to block all premieres, because frankly, I don't care about the initial release.",True

@TheRamosss,2018-10-30T04:14:12Z,0,"I think premieres is a great feature. My only slight frustration with them is seeing a tasty looking video thumbnail in my subscriptions feed, quickly clicking on it, and then realizing I can't watch it yet. I think we should have a filtering tool so one can quickly set notifications for premiers and then hide premiers to only see watchable items.",True

@sebastienjurkowski,2018-10-30T02:36:12Z,1,Reality is that your video tutorials are better than paid udemy classes ( and will likely become refurbished udemy classes üòÇ ) and now you can interact and answer questions while viewer experience them live,True
@deeplizard,2018-10-30T01:43:59Z,1,"Agree with your thoughts especially on the down-votes. We premiered our last release, and it went pretty well. Having the ability to mix regular releases with premieres definitely seems like it adds value!",True

@DigitalicaEG,2018-10-30T01:28:12Z,3,"My only gripe about premiere is that there is no actual notification when the video actually goes live unless you manually set notification. It doesn't even show up as new in the subscription list. It's listed in the subscription list by date of premiere post not actual video post, which is stupid.",True
@Genmaza,2018-10-30T01:04:31Z,0,Love the title,True
@CVasquez112,2018-10-30T00:37:58Z,0,Awesome dude. Always great to hear the other side of the story. People sometimes are too fast to judge a new feature and try to only find the downsides. Keep up the great videos and I look forward to new premiers from you!,True

@talhatariqyuluqatdis,2018-10-29T23:42:14Z,1,I disliked this because it makes me feel cool considering the content of the video,True
@ChadLaFarge,2018-10-29T23:27:57Z,0,"I don't MIND Premiers, but I do get anxious for more content. My bigger issue that the recent series is chunked into < 10 minute pieces. If I'm gearing up to learn sump'in new, I'm just getting interested at 10 minutes, but... it's over. Now I have 24 hours before I can add 6 more lines of code. Love your work, but maybe... 30 minutes or 50 lines of code minimum for coding tutorials?",True
@sysPanda,2018-10-29T22:38:55Z,2,imho the problem with premieres  is that as a viewer you have certain time you can watch stuff and they just clog your subscription feed of channels that you love to watch with stuff that is there and you can't watch it. And since we all live in different time zones it's almost impossible to catch a premiere that is in a moment that you can watch youtube and it clogging your feed when you have the time irritates immensely. The solution might be to move them in a separate thing or give you the option to disable them.,True

@desmondbloemers7276,2018-10-29T22:28:10Z,0,I think he‚Äôs talking about StrangeParts video on the premier feature.,True
@_jelle,2018-10-29T22:26:46Z,0,In my opinion premieres are useless. Why do we need a live chat next to a non-live video? It makes no sense. And the comment section already exists... Don't fix it if it's not broken.,True
@coreyms,2018-10-29T22:07:58Z,31,"That's pretty cool. I saw where the premier functionality was added but I wasn't 100% sure what it was. I'll have to give it a shot soon. Seems like an interesting concept. I shy away from live streams just because I'm not the best at recording off-the-cuff, but this seems like a good way to do a semi-scripted video with some live interaction.",True
@MartinPHellwig,2018-10-29T22:07:21Z,4,"At some point in my feed there where more premiere announcements than actual watch able videos, that was a bit annoying, but that is a UI problem, these should be filtered on their own categories.",True
@EViL3666,2018-10-29T22:03:56Z,1,"On the point about KN having a baby, I agree down voting that is ridiculous. But I do think that YouTube could help the situation, by asking content creators to categorise videos - So I can subscribe to you for example for Code related videos, but not your general updates, after all, thats not why I subscribe to you, so downvote you go!!!  (Just joking and using this as an example!)",True
@thelost1680,2018-10-29T22:00:25Z,0,Thanks for updating the python series. I feel it will help the python community greatly.,True

@dr.mikeybee,2018-10-29T21:55:31Z,0,"BTW, I think you got those down votes because your long-term viewers want more advanced content.  Personally, I enjoy seeing how you present beginning material.  I just watch it at a higher speed.",True
@dr.mikeybee,2018-10-29T21:52:32Z,11,You do a very good job on your tutorials.  They're easy to follow. The fonts are large enough.  The sound is very good.  And I like that you're in the frame as well.   All of this is just as important as your excellent content.,True

@owlbynight_js,2018-10-29T21:39:52Z,2,"It's incredibly annoying to get a notification for a video, click it, and then arrive to a premiere notification instead of the video. If it told me 2 minutes in advance, it would be fine. The chances I return in 30 minutes is zero, especially during a work day.  That said, I understand it's good for communicating with your viewers. However, for me, I'm usually just coming to a video for a few minutes of one thing or another and then clicking off. The notifications let me know when you release a video and if it's something of interest to me, I check it out. If anything, the premiere option sends me looking for similar content on another channel immediately instead of sticking around.",True
@amirroohi4566,2018-10-29T21:24:04Z,1,"But dislikes help the channel as well, let‚Äôs say a video gets a lot of dislikes but very few likes, this will bring it up to the trends, and as we humans are, out of curiosity, we will watch it to find out why that video has been disliked, the more people watch it, the higher it gets, which basically means more money. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, that‚Äôs just what I think",True
@PpVolto,2018-10-29T21:12:38Z,0,I don't watch live streams anymore that's why i am on YouTube and that's why i hate premieres more then before... and i try to avoid any premiere videos since there don't start from the fist second... of the video and you miss many elements... that are possible needed of the content...,True
@rahermosillac,2018-10-29T21:08:59Z,1,"I can't really get used to the Premier thingy, just because sometimes the discussions that take place in the chat while I watch the video are far more interesting that the video itself, so it just becomes noise in the background",True
@abhishekmann,2018-10-29T21:08:36Z,0,Nah I doubt that you'll kill your channel unless you start posting extremely absurd content and stray from what you are good at. Keep up the good work Harrison,True

@Emily_Entropy,2018-10-29T20:55:47Z,0,"I love you Harrison, but I hate these Premieres because I keep getting Desktop Notifications for them. I do NOT have notifications turned on for your channel, because I already watch all the videos you post. I do not need a Desktop Notification for every single video.",True
@atrumluminarium,2018-10-29T20:54:09Z,0,I guess giving viewers the ability to rate the video (both up and down votes) pre-viewing is a bit silly.   By definition it's intended to measure the public opinion on the video but how can one give a good opinion without experiencing it? So I guess YouTube disabling ratings before premiering would be a better design,True
@mrhidetf2,2018-10-29T20:53:55Z,0,to be honest it just spams my notifications and it turns me away from videos. ur call ultimatly but understand when people that even like ur content but dont wanna get spammed unsubscribe (i think the channel that was talking about the downside u meant was jarvis),True
