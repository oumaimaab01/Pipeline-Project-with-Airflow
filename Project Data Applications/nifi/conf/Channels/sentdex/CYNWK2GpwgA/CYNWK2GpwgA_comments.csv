@MrCarri,2015-02-18T21:32:46Z,0,"I really liked kivy when I heard about it, but i didn't pay much attention. The python and pygame tutorial you did on the newboston helped me a lot to understand and I really loved it. So I will follow this tutorial / course, I'm very interested as I'm learning how to program in my first year in the university.  Two questions: how does run natively on an android phone? if i have, for example, too many unnecesary conditonals, it will be slowed a lot? And another thing, the best option to distribute the code to a phone, it should be using bulldozer?  Thanks for all you do, I'm sorry if my English is not the best, I'm not native but i try. :)",True
