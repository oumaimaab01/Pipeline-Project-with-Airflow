Could giving the AI an analogue output on the throttle and steering make it more smooth? You could have it send the input as a polar coordinate between 0 and 360° and 0-100 or an x and a y.

Think evolutionary models would be nice, with crashes, driving on the wrong side of the road, running red lights,  going tom much over the speed limit as game-over points for getting into the next iteration.

Normally this is done by finding a mean image, normalizing it between 0 and 1, subtract it from the normalized input image. This will center your data distribution to 0, which is important for training.

On the controller however, it's more realistic, as you can hold down the trigger button and depending on how much you hold down (0% - 100%), it will have a different constant speed. Maybe making Charles simulate the trigger button of a controller, to use it at 50% - 70%, will make him drive slower and steadier, which will cause less accidents.",True

@resonance999,2018-09-12T06:41:38Z,0,"This method is hitting the most known bumps in imitation learning (which is what the general method sentex is using is called). Specifically, if the car deviates from doing the right thing a little bit (strays from the lane), it won't know what to do next, because most of the examples in the data set are of staying neatly on lane, and this error compounds.  One known solution is to train the model to rectify itself so it doesn't reach unknown territory (driving off road).  A common way of doing this is to add  two cameras slightly  tilted to the sides to simulate a situation where the car is veering off. The left camera's images should be labeled to turn right and vice versa. Of course, this  solution might be difficult to implement in gta v. Another approach is data aggregation (DAgger), where after training the model is let out into the wild to do it's own thing and start making mistakes. As it gets into these new situations,  the observations (video frames) should be recorded and a human will manually label them with the right course of action. Then the model is retrained with the old data + new data, and the process is repeated until the model performs well. Sentex's thought of having data about what to do when you hit a tree does much the same thing. The other suggestions for improving the model are general improvements, but won't fix the underlying problems of this learning method and are unlikely to yield much improvement.

I.e. distance from objects etc. Perhaps a mod that adds stereoscopic 3D or VR, and thus a seperate image for each eye would allow calculation of distance, and thus mimic advanced sensors on actual self driving vehicles.
