Have you ever used Google Cloud Platform? Or have you ever thought of making a tutorial on Google App Engine or AWS, or any other similar service for that matter. Putting your site Heroku or something... I know you can put an app live with App Engine with it's free tier, but I never got around with it. It can be confusing. Also, on the other hand, will you ever make any videos on web security? For instance, if you'd create an app where users would have to register - i.e. protecting their data and that sort of stuff...",True
