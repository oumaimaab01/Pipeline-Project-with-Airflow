@sofiac7243,2016-07-18T03:44:59Z,0,"Hi I don't seem to be able to get the image displayed as you do. I run the code, doesn't return any error but it doesn't even do anything, it just launches an app that came with the python download and nothing happens.I use OSx and python 2.7.3 64 bit. my code is :  from PIL import Image import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  i = Image.open('images/dot.png')  iar = np.asarray(i)  plt.imshow(iar) plt.show  I use Textwrangler instead of IDLE usually, but I've tried to run it with IDLE and directly on python window but nothing changed with those either.... i'd appreciate your help!",True

@sentdex,2014-06-25T02:44:43Z,1,"phur tenzin Strange error, something appears awry with your interaction with the numpy module. AFAIK, numpy is fully ported to python 3+, but you might need some slight changes to syntax. Not sure about that one. From a Google search, people are suggesting you re-install numpy with pip install.",True
