@threeMetreJim,2019-06-26T17:53:24Z,0,"This might be interesting to try.  Classifying pictures, by only taking random pixels from them.  To train you'd give a picture, and for every random pixel from that specific picture train it by telling the network that all those pixels come from that specific picture class.  Repeat for all pictures and classes.  To test,  you'd get a picture and sample random pixels, but take the mean average of each output class, for however many pixels you try.  It sounds rather illogical but something like a picture of sky, will have a higher percentage of blue or white pixels and that you can often tell what something is just by seeing a small proportion of the image.  It would be nice if it did work, it wouldn't matter about translation or rotation as pixels are randomly sampled, however, there would be no spatial information to work from. Maybe adding some spatial reference to the randomness (distance between sampled co-ordinates??) could help.  Just a crazy idea.",True
@samuelebrg8845,2018-05-22T11:24:05Z,0,"Hi there! really nice video!  I would like to ask you a question:  I am working on Pointnet ( neural network for point cloud ) and I am using two dataset, with one of them I have really low performance, in fact in the training phase the architecture decide always for one class!!  I think that the problem is due to the scarcity of data (200 data in total) I have try to apply data agumentation ( I have achieve 10240 samples) but I have still the same results.  The dataset is  balanced in terms of class (almost the same amount of samples per class)  Do you have some idea or hints in order to solve this problem ?  I can share the code here if is fine for you",True
@tuongduong9606,2018-04-13T06:39:15Z,0,Hi Sentdex.  Thank you for all of the useful videos.  I hope you can make the series of ARCore on Android for everyone.,True

@RecursiveRuminations,2018-04-09T06:28:32Z,1,"Hey Sentdex, why not build a Generative Adversarial Network and just output the results from both NN's? Wouldn't this achieve a similar output and training methods? Awsome video btw, also glad to see  you on Linux!",True
@sibyjoseplathottam4828,2018-04-08T22:47:18Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, Are you using the latest version of TensorFlow. I noticed that you were still getting warning that TensorFlow was not compiled to use SSE4.1 and SSE4.2 instructions. But from version 1.6 TensorFlow prebuilt binaries use these instructions.",True
@idiocracy10,2018-04-08T22:29:59Z,0,"sentdex, what is the current viability to use a bot or the generative stuff to create fake videos to spoof the markets,  like a grainy video with machine generated audio that purports to show a major ceo or politician doing something that would shake the markets?",True
@simbarasheclevermupfururir1566,2018-04-08T19:35:32Z,1,Hi Sentdex. Thanks for the great series. I'm loving it a lot. I have a CPU so obviously my machine is very slow when training and also I will be putting my machine at risk. I have discovered Google colab which offers a GPU for free on the cloud as long as you have a gmail account,True

@manashejmadi,2018-04-08T14:05:31Z,5,"hey Sentdex i Have this idea of mine but i do not have the Programming Skills and Technical know-how to complete this, Basically It is like a Deep learning model which continuously expands its abilities and knowledge by extracting data from various websites and articles and then learning based on it. Could you make something like that? Please answer and tell me if is this Question is even valid or not",True
