@kjfinnegan5910,2019-10-25T19:33:19Z,0,This series has been really useful. Just wondering what you recommend for the best way for a menu option to load a new page/screen (i.e. a new set of widgets displayed within the same window). Obviously quite a common design feature of any application but I can’t find much info on how to do it with PyQt. Stacked widgets maybe?,True

@shashankns5994,2017-03-09T14:27:13Z,20,"For people who are using Ubuntu, the menuBar doesn't appear because it's a feature of Ubuntu's Unity shell called global menu bar.  So, if you want your menu to take its place on top of a window regardless of graphical shell preferences, you should use Qt menu bar instead of native one:          mainMenu = QtGui.QMenuBar()         mainMenu.setNativeMenuBar(False)         self.setMenuBar(mainMenu)                  fileMenu = mainMenu.addMenu('File')         fileMenu.addAction(extractAction)",True
