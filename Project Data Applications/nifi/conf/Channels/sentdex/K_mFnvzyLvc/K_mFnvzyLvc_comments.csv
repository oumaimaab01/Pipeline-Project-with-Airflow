@hamedatohamedato521,2019-06-07T19:43:05Z,6,"Folks! Installing labelImg is not difficult at all and you don't have to switch to Ubuntu if don't want to. Maybe it was difficult in past or maybe it's still difficult if you follow Github's installation instruction but there's an easy way to install it. Unlike Github's installation instruction that says to go to the link for PyQT5 and install .exe and before that you would also need to install Win10 SDK for Microsoft VS, Sip and QT, which are really pain in the butt and at the end QTCore won't be recognized, just install it through pip: pip install pyqt5. That's it guys! You saved hours of installation of different software and packages! Then, again there's a mistake in Github's installation instruction, so type this in a cmd opened in your labelImg directory: pyrcc5 -o libs/resources.py resources.qrc And finally: python labelImg.py And life is good afterwards!!",True

BOOM! Now you can draw a box and then just press 'd' for the next image, it will automatically save the .xml files(first time it will ask the destination folder though).  PS: Another awesome speed up tip - If you are just using one class, look on the top right side. Check the option 'Use default label' and enter the one class name you want to assign. For example, 'car' if you want to detect car in every image. This way it will not ask you the label name everytime you draw a RectBox. So just draw the RectBox around the car and press 'd' for next image. This automatically saves the generated .xml file and with the one and only label you want to assign! So useful !!!

I m thinking that maybe the network will ""learn"" some artifacts of my camera instead of the object itself (as all images will be recorderd with the same camera).
