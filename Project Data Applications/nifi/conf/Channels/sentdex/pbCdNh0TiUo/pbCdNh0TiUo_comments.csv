@michaelharris2493,2016-02-09T19:40:44Z,0,The Enable A and Enable B are used for speed control  it uses PWM and the Raspberry does not support PWM natively but you can get a servo control board for the Raspberry PI from SainSmart that has a PWM chip on it.

@s3340985,2015-07-12T12:59:39Z,0,6:40 - you are doing it wrong. You are not supposed to connect 5V on the board to 5V on the Pi. That is a 5V OUT on the board if your power supply is 7-12V and the 12V jumper is in place (which is in place in your video),True
