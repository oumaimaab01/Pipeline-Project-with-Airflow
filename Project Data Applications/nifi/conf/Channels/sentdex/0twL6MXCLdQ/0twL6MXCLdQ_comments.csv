@JustinTermaat,2017-02-26T02:43:25Z,5,"when you do `operation = args.operation` you are not copying the variable but just giving it another label. In fact it can be smart to do this, for example when the body of your function is a loop doing this can make the lookups faster. You would however be copying the variable if you were to alter it like `operation = args.operation.lower()` because strings are immutable python would then create a new string and since the old string still has a reference (args.operation) this would mean having two strings in memory.",True

@mamazu1995,2016-11-03T14:34:09Z,0,"Nice video, got a few questions however. First of all, one advantage of argparse over the normal argv method is that you can specify the ""name"" of the argument you want to parse like --x and so on. Would this also work if you just gave it positional arguments like: ""python calc.py 2 3 sub"" or is the name of the arguments always required? Furthermore, is there a way to catch more arguments than specified? Second: You have changed the purpose of the calc function completely. Which is in my opinion not a good idea. To change existing and ""in use code"" (adding to the fact that it looks uglier now). Why didn't you choose to call the calc function with the arguments like calc(args.x, args.y, args.operation). Cause now you require an object in your calc function with certain properties. Thirdly: What is your opinion on local imports? Are they faster more efficient in any ways? Have played with them myself. But I don't really know when to use which. But in your case it wouldn't be much of a difference.",True
