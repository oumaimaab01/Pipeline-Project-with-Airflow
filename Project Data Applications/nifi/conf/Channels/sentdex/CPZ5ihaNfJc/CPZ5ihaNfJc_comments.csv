@revatijoshi144,2017-02-17T08:52:51Z,34,"Since 'padding' factor is 'same' and image size is now 50*50*20, here's my take at how to calculate the number to reshape the tensor at the last layer. This was also explained on Tensorflow-deep MNIST tutorial.  50*50*20 - after applying maxpool 3d - with ksize being 2*2*2 (in your code) shape after 1st layer  : 25*25*10 (running 2*2*2 window on image reduces the size to this) 25*25*10 - after applying the same for the second time (i.e., maxpool3d with 2*2*2 window size) shape of the image : 13*13*5  Now, the image size and the features number i.e., 64(as in your code) will yield the number that you need to use : 13*13*5*64 = 54080  This is as I mentioned by following the MNIST logic here : https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros  Great series of videos, highly inspired by your work :)",True

@raconteurhermit1533,2021-09-05T19:58:48Z,1,"The formula for finding the output dimensions after a convolutions is  d = floor((dimension -kernel) / stride) + 1. Apply this on each of the dimensions to calculate output dimension size Original size is 50x50x20 , stride = 2 , kernel size/conv filter size = 2 Using this after the first conv filter ,size is  For X and Y dimensions (50 - 2)/2 + 1 = 25. For Z dimension (20-2)/2 + 1 = 10 Size/Dimensions after first Conv operation = 25x25x10 After the second one conv operation,  X and Y dimensions floor((25 - 2) / 2) + 1 = 13 For Z dimension (10-2)/2 + 1 = 5 Size/Dimensions after first Conv operation = 13x13x5 Now, the image size and the features number i.e., 64(as in your code)  will yield the number that you need to use : 13*13*5*64 = 54080  Reference  NPTEL Lecture by IITD Professor   https://youtu.be/JZZ5Bd7SQPE",True

@AmirhoseinHerandy,2017-02-22T04:44:25Z,0,"What Revati mentioned was for max pooling and same size padding. If you are going to use custom numbers like I usually do you can compute the output dimensions in this way. m = ((n - kernel_size + 2*padding)/stride)+1. m is the new dimension size, n is the dimension size for the previous layer, so you n by n image from the first layer turns into an m by m layer (This formula is for the 2 version so for 3d you should probably just use 3*padding), and s is the stride step size. http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/",True
