@hEmZoRz,2022-02-27T17:40:14Z,0,"Love your videos. Just a quick note though: it's not a good practice to use regular dropout layers before LSTM layers as it hinders learning (see e.g. Yarin Gal ""Uncertainty in Deep Learning"" (2016) for technicalities). For this reason, all Keras recurrent layers have a special dropout feature compatible with recurrent layer architecture that you can enable by typing ""recurrent_dropout=<rate>"" when initializing the layer.",True

@rahulbhatia5657,2019-01-21T16:19:40Z,0,Hello everyone! Great Video....loved it! Just one question...in general...we should train an LSTM for how many epochs...I know it depends on case to case basis but still like you would train an ANN for 100 epochs...why train an LSTM for just 3...and what difference does it make...if anyone could help..I Would really appericate.

@hamedatohamedato521,2018-10-17T18:56:34Z,4,"I remember my self-driving car algorithm trained on CNN used to go backward while there was no need for that and it could have gone forward. And I knew why! Because we unsorted the data in order to unbalance it so the training was confused what to do with a single image that sometimes its target says to go forward and sometimes to go backward. So, I'm thinking of training my self-driving car algorithm using RNN which I think it would benefit to learning how to smoothly reduce the speed and turn. But two concerns: 1) Should I still unbalance the data? 2) LSTMs need the input image to be reshaped to a vector. Can I apply the whole image as 2D input to LSTMs by modifying them into convolutional network with some sort of memory to remember dependency between following frames? Thanks!",True
@Kuteiru,2018-10-07T18:13:37Z,0,"Hi, great tutorial sir!  Just a simple comment, the mnist training set is usually shuffled before begining of the training, maybe that is the reason the val_accuracy is bigger than the accuracy but I'm sorry if i'm mistaken.  Thank you!",True

@Annunaki_0517,2018-09-09T04:20:22Z,1,"Wondering why you chose to go with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) instead of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the recurrent hidden unit in the layers.  While Googling around for more info on the LSTM function, I came across a research paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3555v1.pdf) which seemed to say that, in most cases, GRU was the way to go both in terms of results and computational speed.  And since there appears to be a CuDNNGRU function in the CuDNN library, it seems like a lay-up.  From the paper: ""Based on our experiments, we concluded that by using a fixed number of parameters for all models, on some datasets GRU can outperform LSTM units both in terms of convergence in CPU time and in terms of parameter updates and generalization.""",True
