It is a tremendous task keeping one's Ego in check.  and I must reluctantly agree that it is my own Ego I was  referencing....and, out of my frustration, like all Egos, attacked the closest target available at the time.        A most difficult task it is creating content and presenting it to those of us who want something for little of nothing.   It is obvious that you are passionate about what you do,  and perhaps the lens from which I was observing,  it has become ever so clear that perhaps I mistook that passion for Ego.  It happens.  Most important is being aware of it.....Ill close with this.   Ex:  Let's use one who can't concentrate.  That's inattention.    BEING AWARE OF THAT INATTENTION...IS ATTENTION.... DON'T say I can't concentrate and go try n find some method of trying to keep one's attention focused,  like meditation for example.  NO.  .....BE AWARE OF THAT INATTENTION AND IN THAT AWARENESS...
