@GrandpasPlace,2021-02-26T16:23:15Z,4,This series was good up to part 7. I would have loved to see how you did the actual chat bot. How the user input is processed and fed to the NN and how the output is post processed. More so than pointing to a git repo of the stuff being done.  The previous bots I have done were AIML so trying to learn how I can get better results from NN and NLP,True

I'm thinking about running a few epochs on a certain size of data (say 5 million pairs) before moving on to new data. It won't result in underfitting and if it running too many epochs results in overfitting then throwing more data will bring the high variance down.,True

@chinmoyjyotikathar8793,2017-12-16T12:27:41Z,0,Is there any reason you stand and code? Just curious :-) xoxo,True
@IsalaPiyarisi,2017-12-16T11:17:09Z,0,Hey Sendex will I be able to train a model with Standard GPU Air VPS from paperspace ? and if so how much time will it take ? (can't afford dedicated GPU's). My Local Machine also have only nvidia geforce 920m and what will be faster my local gpu or paperspace gpu ?,True

@PhotoSlash,2017-12-15T19:28:48Z,16,"What if you start the conversation with ""do you like ice cream?"" and then after the bot answers you keep asking something about the ice cream but without mentioning again the subject of the question? (like ""what flavor do you prefer?"") will it be able to understand that you are referring to the last subject the bot read on the previous question? i think this is one of the things that MUST be accomplished with deep learning..",True

@ishantpundir9747,2017-12-15T15:42:07Z,2,hey what if instead of scoring them manually ¬†... you can use a text classifier but as data will be a problem so instead of using DNN use SVM they works relatively better with small data as compare to DNN ...........  good part of classifier is that they will also output the score in the form of confidence level so ¬†you can add any manual parameters on top of that score to get a nice and meaningfull output.¬†  I can help you with that I am working on relatively bigger project(right now personal but it is going to be commercial within a year) but it is also completely ¬†based on AI so I have been through all of this there are also many other ways in my mind to make it better then twitters version ...... ¬† I can help you if you want peace,True
@xarifsowad849,2017-12-15T14:57:25Z,0,Harrison...will u please do some video on python and android....Android is the hot topic right now and python is too.So if we can combine them them that will be great.I am dying for it.Java is a complete tear down to me.,True
