@jonathan-._.-,2019-05-17T16:11:23Z,0,"ways to defeine functions :  1. (...vars)=>{...} 2. element => element.test (= (element)=>{return element.test;}) 3. function <name>(...vars){...} ways to call functions: 1. (function(...vars){...})(...vars); 2.((...vars)=>{...})(...vars); 3 function <name> (...vars){...}; <name>(...vars);  for functions where you need a function as parameter using lamda functions is sometimes a better idea : mostly dependent on how often it is used setTimeout(()=>{...},1000); otherwise: setTimeout(<name>,1000)   since the context ('this') in javascript changes for events a sometimes useful structure is this: (useful if you create a bunch of elements in a for loop for example which reassigns the reference after the loop) function customOnload(){...} element.onload=((param)=>{return ()=>{param.doStuff()}})(contextSpecificParameter);",True
