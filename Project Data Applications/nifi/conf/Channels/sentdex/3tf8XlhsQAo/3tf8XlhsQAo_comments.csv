@IZRRL,2017-12-06T07:19:57Z,47,"If things aren't working out for you as they are the in tutorial.  It could be because this tutorial was meant for an earlier version of django.  If you uploaded version 2.0 as i did there are changes that create errors.  I was getting an error due to in the video he shows ""url"" syntex and the new replacement for ""url"" is ""path"".  if you use syntex meant for ""url"" it won't work with new ""path"" version.  So you have to change the line from ""from django.urls import path""  in both urls.py files to ""from django.urls import re_path"" and then change ""path('^$', views.index, name='index')]"" to ""re_path('^$', views.index, name='index')]"" .  and bam it works.  Problem is you now have to learn the new syntex for ""path"" because ""re_path"" might not be around for long.  so the syntex in this video is outdated at least for this part of tutorial"".  This might seem confusing but i bet this will help you figure it out in less than 2 hours, which is how long it took me.",True

@SubwayToSally90,2016-01-22T11:33:53Z,30,"The episode title as well as some of your talkings are missleading. What you have done is the ""django template languag"" (DTL). It is really similar to Jinja2 but it's not the same (Jinja2 is inspired by the DTL). Since django 1.8 you can switch or have multiple template engines. Jinja2 is one of the additional engines. If someone stumbles upon a problem or he searches for a solution, and he searches ""jinja"" instead of ""django"" he may find a solution that will not work for him. DTL can a lot of the things Jinja2 can but not everything (e.g. methodcalls are different DTL: {% page.get_author %} and Jinja2: {% page.get_author() %})  Also, your templates structure is a bit confusing. Your ""header.html"" is more like a base.html because it contains more than just your header. If so, souldn't it live in your global template directory? Maybe you just have done that to start of easy?  Despite these little 2 points: Thumbs up! Really good video again. Keep up the work.",True
