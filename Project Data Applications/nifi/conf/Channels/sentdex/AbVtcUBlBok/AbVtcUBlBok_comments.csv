@christoffaloffagus9713,2017-02-09T16:04:02Z,2,"Great tutorial series, the math of SVM's is a bit above my head but i have an idea at least, I just have a couple of questions.  Forgive me if this is a dumb question as I am just a beginner but, why ""if self.visualization""? won't that always be true? having just been set.  I would also would like to know why the extra comma in np.array in the dictionary as TpBrass0 asks.",True
@TpBrass0,2017-02-01T14:44:09Z,2,"Hi I had a question. Why use -1:np.array([[1,7],                           [2,8],                           [3,8], ]) rather -1:np.array([[1,7],                           [2,8],                           [3,8]]) Not sure why we need the comma in the end of the array.  I've seen some people use np.array in this way  but I don't know why, and I don't know how to find the reason on google.",True

@siddharthkotwal8823,2016-05-30T18:39:43Z,7,"Hey man, I really like this series. Your delivery is pretty awesome and relatable; somewhat similar to how I speak to myself in my head while working on a project :)   I had one general question as someone trying to learn CS. What is your approach to learning new mathematical/statistical material like ML? Say I pick up a book or a course, what are the best practices for striking the right balance between theory and practice? I often find it hard to get the applied skills (cos understanding the theory and algos properly saps my energy and then I move to the next algorithm!). Second, how often do you have to come back to these principles or examples? Would be great to have your advice!",True
@leandrowitzke6405,2016-05-24T00:39:09Z,2,"Hi. I'm doing a project with SVM , I have to classify objects in three different classes, but each object has about 40 attributes. There a way to illustrate this scheme ? Greetings from Argentina",True
@michaeldot6732,2016-05-23T19:34:46Z,6,I am a beginner of Python. It is fantastic to find your videos here. They are incredibly helpful and I just wanna thank you before I give up learning......hope it never happens though:-),True
