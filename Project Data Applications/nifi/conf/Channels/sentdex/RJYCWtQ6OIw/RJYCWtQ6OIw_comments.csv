@MrAbatecaller,2018-07-22T16:27:47Z,0,Sentdex. Good effort.  Would like if you could help build all data into a panda dataframe for all firms or those we select.  Believe you have already identified the error in your D/E interpretation...,True
@yachiwang6877,2016-01-10T22:07:25Z,0,"Quote from Investopedia: . A relatively high debt/equity ratio is commonplace in the banking industry and in the financial services sector as a whole. Banks carry greater debt amounts because the money they borrow is also the money they lend. To put it another way, the major product that banks sell is debt. Therefore, it is logical that they have more of that product on hand than is common in other industries.

@mrbighit,2014-11-14T11:31:00Z,0,I'm not sure if your explanation on N/A on debt to equity is correct. Â I'm assuming the N/A for debt-to-equity is for the case where the company holds zero debt but some cash and other debts in credit (as assets).,True
@ortzg,2013-11-23T05:55:32Z,1,"I know this is intended for newbie programmers, but i'd just like to share what I did in speeding up the process. I used your teaching as basis and added threads to it. Lots of it. 50 threads to get Yahoo's key stats data. I did put a sleep period for every time I created threads (be nice to Yahoo). That sped things up by about an order of magnitude. And if we downloaded the csv file from Yahoo at 200 stocks at a time it sped the whole process up by at least two orders of maginitude. You can't get all of the data by choosing to download the csv from yahoo but by combining it with the threaded html retriever it's all very nice. Russell 3000 data thread-retrieved in under 5 seconds, filter it with some criteria and then thread retrieve the D/E ratio of the shortlisted stocks. All in under 10 seconds :)) Programming sure is nice, namely Python programming!!",True
