@skyfly200,2019-01-20T23:30:09Z,0,How is your IDE setup to let you just run the functions in your source from that Python shell? I am using VS Code for this and have to run the file each time and add the desired function call at the end of the file. It would be great to be able to run a command against the state of the program live as I see you do at 12:15. Is it just a feature of IDLE's REPL? Can I get this working with the REPL in VSCode? Thanks,True

@jcandan82,2017-08-26T19:22:34Z,1,"really glad i found this series, your videos are helpful. is there a reason you went with reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, outcome_range) as opposed to just sum(outcome_range)? just curious if i'm missing something.",True
@rl4777,2017-07-02T07:01:46Z,0,why running patternAr[5] would return a list? i think we only appended the local variable in the function but the global variable should remain unchanged?,True

@EditorsCanPlay,2016-07-08T13:52:31Z,5,"Hello Sentdex, I really don't understand what patternstorage does exactly? What is it achieving,  why do we -30 from x? why 30 and not any other value? I know this is a stupid question but I've watched this and the previous two videos but I still don't understand? Thanks",True

@Marcos10PT,2016-06-17T22:35:02Z,6,10 lines of creating similar values and then 10 lines of appending each of those values to an array   I bet you cringe so hard watching this. At least hopefully you do :D,True

@MrBEasy78,2014-02-08T17:50:41Z,0,"I have a question that I must have missed watching the videos.  On line outcomeRange = avgLine[y+20:y+30], why did you choose 20 and 30. Our first pattern is avgline[1:10], and the performance or avgOutcome is the percent change of our currentPoint or avgLine[10] to the average of avgLine[30:40].  Why do we compare so far into the future?  Or why wouldnt we check for percentage change of the next 10 elements?",True
@bdeely,2013-12-01T07:07:45Z,0,"Really noob question, but how are you getting to load the functions around 7:15 into python without having it run the entire script and graphs, etc?   I just know about this: - cd into folder then call the .py file to run the entire script  I tried googling it but to no avail. It'd be great to know for quick debugging/testing.",True
