@xxcsokixx,2020-09-30T20:42:19Z,0,"Hi! I have a question. Why are we sure that the prediction is equal to the chance of survival? Why can it not be any other value? We removed the survival rate from the dataset, but we could have removed any other value. And if we didn't remove any value we would still get a prediction around 70% is my guess.",True
@akif6233,2020-07-27T10:42:10Z,0,guys could you explain how predict fuction return 0 or 1 ? how it knows ?,True
@batatambor,2020-05-22T13:00:10Z,0,"IMO what you could have done is to divide original data in each of the two generated clusters and inside each one of them calculate the rate of survival. You can assess where you are prediciting it right. You could have one cluster where you are getting a 90% accuracy but it is small, while the other has 60% acurracy and it is larger.  You could've also tried to generate different numbers of clusters, and assess mortality inside each one of them.",True

@amdreallyfast,2018-11-30T16:08:46Z,0,"I took this tutorial and ran with it, combining other of your tutorials on generators and multiprocessing with a stackoverflow post on built-in python functionality for generating all subsets of a set to create a multiprocessing, brute-force, all-combination feature set KMeans classifier just for kicks to try to see which combination of feature sets would yield the highest accuracy (taking into account the reciprocal of the accuracy if <50%).   I haven't run the whole thing yet because 13 features (14 sans ""survived"" = 13) yields 2^13 = 8192 combinations. Ran 700 of them though and found, shockingly, that the presence of ""boat"" appeared to have a significant impact on survival rate. Not as shockingly though, using only the feature set ""boat"" yielded ~81% accuracy, and so did (boat, sex), (boat, parch), and (boat, sex, parch).  I don't know what to make of this. Is it saying that other features were pretty much useless if they got into a lifeboat? Note that I replaced nan with 0. Hopefully that didn't mess it up.",True
