@johnredmund4753,2017-01-16T07:12:00Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, thanks so much for the awesome vids!  Quick question. I noticed that calculating RSI in python vs calculating in Excel yields fairly large differences in outcome due to float point rounding differences. The differences are fairly small objectively (may only be off by a few 0.0001's or something), but due to the nature of the RSI calculation they can end up resulting in differences of over 10 points in the final RSI.   With that in mind, how do you handle this type of issue when you are running calculations? A 10+ difference in RSI can be a huge difference when it is the difference between RSI of 60 and RSI of 70, for example. How do you know which value ( Excel, Python, or some other) is correct?",True
