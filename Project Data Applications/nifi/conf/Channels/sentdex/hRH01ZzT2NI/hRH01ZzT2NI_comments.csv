@JtotheAKOB,2021-03-16T17:01:13Z,1,"Hey sentdex, i reeeeeally appreciate your tutorials! You have a great  way of explaining clearly but also entertaining and keeping up the focus  and interest!  I just have one request. I cant wrap (hehe) my mind around decorator  methods, in your example ""at""app.callback(). I dont get how the  dcc.input is explicitly connected to input-data. I learned a lot through  your tutorial on pythonprogramming.net and another one but  unfortunately nothing about decorator methods like the one here. Maybe  in a side-line about decorator as classes, which i then obviously didnt  get^^ Would you pleeeeeeeease help me? At least with some link :P",True

@devon5694,2018-02-16T02:17:30Z,0,"definitely interesting.  I'll have to read the docs on using this as a flask extension...seems like it would be very difficult to write a complicated UI in a .py file, but perhaps that's personal preference from using PHP.  Also, I might change the value attribute to a placeholder to get rid of the instruction text",True

If you could please elaborate on that topic it would be so much appreciated.",True
@arjunkirpal9776,2018-02-14T03:35:53Z,0,"Would LOVE if you could integrate Asyncio with Dash! Raymond Hettinger said Asyncio is the future of Python. I understand with Asyncio Python can take Node.js head on. Particularly when using Asyncio with UVLOOP. Thank you for all your awesome tutorials! You are doing so much more for the world than the bureaucrats at UN, UNESCO etc !!",True

@AmDsus2Fmaj7Am,2018-02-13T16:49:19Z,0,"Harrison, have you heard of the bokeh library? I found it yesterday, trying to use the financial part of matplotlib that has been deprecated. It's a lot like dash because the output images can be html, it can make some beautiful charts, and it doesn't require plotly. It integrates nicely with Jupyter notebooks as well. Cheers",True

@HandFedMole,2018-02-13T16:33:02Z,0,"I think it would be useful to show the app.callback signature, unless I'm missing something.  Super psyched for this as an alternative to R Shiny.
