@R3KS9476,2021-03-11T06:31:30Z,0,"I ran into an issue with this method perhaps somebody can help explain me a way to fix, I started using this when designing a game it worked fine but I decided to make the game completely resizable everything else works but my mouse events remain where they are from original resolution after resizing, how can I make my mouse events move with the buttons upon window resizing..",True
@bigboibob2568,2021-02-20T03:51:09Z,0,My button has a messed up collision so when I hover my mouse over it doesn't change colour unless I find the sweetspot  Nevermind I fixed it problem was I put [0] instead of [1] on the second part of if statement just a tip for people who run into this:),True

@thegamingdirector9859,2019-06-21T00:09:10Z,0,"if you have problems getting the buttons to highlight try moving these lines up... it worked for me.           pygame.draw.rect(GameDisplay, green, (150, 450, 100, 50))         pygame.draw.rect(GameDisplay, red, (550, 450, 100, 50))         put them right above getting the mouse position",True
@skycloud4802,2019-06-18T12:28:26Z,0,"I am still stuck on the highlighting of my boxes. When I hover my curser over it, I get unsatisfactory results. The logic is hard for my head to wrap. I've even slowed down the video plenty of times.  I find the displaying of rect such as X and y values easier because at least I can visualize the size and position of the rect after I have test played the game. The highlighting of rect is hard to visualise (even with coordinates turned on for some reason) because if it doesn't highlight, then I am trying to keep moving my mouse around to find the 'hit box' or collision area.",True
@skyerosebud,2019-05-24T11:02:11Z,1,You know you really do a great job at this.  You explain yourself really well and you have a really easy-going lighthearted manner that makes it so enjoyable to learn with you.  Thanks for making this set of pygame instructionals!,True

@MsJavaWolf,2017-08-19T13:04:37Z,0,Is it common practice in pygame to create something like a button with a simple function? My first intuition would have been a class and then let the button draw itself in a member method.,True

@sentdex,2015-01-28T22:04:49Z,3,"Kieran Goodson so far, 100% of the time someone has sworn they copied identically, they have not. It's very easy to miss something small. Head over to  http://pythonprogramming.net/making-interactive-pygame-buttons/ for the source code. Try to copy and paste the source code. If it works, then you just need to look super close for the difference.",True
