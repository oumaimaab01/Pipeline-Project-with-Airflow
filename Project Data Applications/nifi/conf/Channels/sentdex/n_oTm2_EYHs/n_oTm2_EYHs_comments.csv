@exmachina767,2016-07-26T00:39:31Z,0,"I really don't think it's a good practice what is suggested in this video regarding the use of just one or two templates to contain multiple logically distinct pages.   Sorry if the analogy is not very creative, but that's like eating a three-course meal all in one plate (and using just a fork)!  Proper separation of concerns and keeping code short is paramount to creating maintainable code, something that any programmer comes to appreciate after a few years of practice.",True
@ricardo.mazeto,2016-06-29T20:17:00Z,0,No NO NO! IT's stinks like PHP! Who first had that idea of mix markup with logic? Would be way easier to send the data in json and parse it in vanilla Javascript! AAARGH! I wanna punch someone in the face!,True

@TheddunTOSS,2015-04-25T00:20:38Z,0,"Hi sentdex,  I just realized the following problem:  if I try to define and call a varibale within a function the whole script fails to start (something about indention level, but this has nothing to do with it). However, if I define the varibale outside the function and call it within it works.  Can this have something to do with me using Python 3?",True
