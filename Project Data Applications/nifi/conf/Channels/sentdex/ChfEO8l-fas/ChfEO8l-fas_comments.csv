@darkhero7,2024-05-28T21:38:16Z,0,"cool video! You may check the example that I have done in my channel to visualize training, learning, gradients and activations.",True
@sguha7850,2024-04-16T08:13:04Z,0,Is it possible to visualize the network architecture directly from the code I build?,True
@bhaskarmondal7461,2024-04-15T02:06:53Z,0,"hei just a simple question to you all, Is it possible to make an web app like streamlit out of it ?",True

@kotcraftchannelukraine6118,2024-02-17T17:26:33Z,0,I watched your video of GameGAN (GTA-5 running only on a neural network). This is mind blowing! I try to recreate it with Tux Racer game,True

@lucasb.2410,2024-02-15T21:20:00Z,0,likin' the great old sentdex style ! :p,True
@davidanalyst671,2024-02-15T18:06:11Z,1,"we dont want visualizations.  we want a GUI tool to adjust the network in order to create the hotspots we want.  Sure, shirt and coat are confused, but not if we create two different hotspots based on the thickness of the arms of the product.  It wouldn't even be close.  make a tool to use gui crap to adjust a NN and make it conceptual",True

@carnap355,2024-02-15T07:46:52Z,0,"In PyTorch this can be automated using register_forward_hooks. It even works on custom layers I make. Only issue is how do I visualize convolutional layer weights when there are 128 64x2x2 kernels, so I think I show first 9 kernels in a grid and take first 3 channels",True

@yuanfongsu,2024-02-15T02:40:46Z,0,"Very useful! Thank you for sharing. One question, since we could know which neuron is more important for a specific class. Can we find out what filters (or kernels) in the three layers makes it important to the specific class?",True
@thesmallestatom,2024-02-15T01:51:36Z,0,"the concept of “hidden layers” might be the biggest crime. they are NOT hidden, and they can be introspected.",True
