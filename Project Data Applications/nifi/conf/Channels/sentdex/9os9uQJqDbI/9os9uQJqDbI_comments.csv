@maxlee3838,2018-01-02T18:04:14Z,12,"So I just finished processing the comments for 2017-11, and came to the following conclusions:  1. Sqlite is convenient, but slow as frozen excrement on a spinning disk drive. To get around this, I setup a ramdisk (I'm cheap and didn't opt for an SSD, but I do have some RAM), and gave it ~8GB RAM, which greatly increased loading/row-pairing speed (about 100-150x faster than spinning disk).  2. The slowest part of this script is the deleting null parents and especially vacuuming. If you have the space for it (and an SSD), set your cleanup value to something like 40,000,000 rows (I was limited by the size of my ramdisk, but other might not have this limitation). I set my ""cleanup"" value to 10,000,000.  3. By default, sqlite has journaling enabled, which is extremely useful when inserting data, in case something goes wrong. However, when it comes to the delete and vacuum stages, having journaling turned on is a double whammy--- It creates a copy of the "".db"" as a journal, which exploded my ramdisk that caused the script to fail.   To get around this, I modified the cleanup section of code to the below:  ################################################             if row_counter > start_row:                 if row_counter % cleanup == 0:                     print(""Cleaning up!"")                     print(""Turning journal off temporarily..."")                     c.execute(""PRAGMA journal_mode = OFF"")                     print(""Deleting null parent rows..."")                     sql = ""DELETE FROM parent_reply WHERE parent IS NULL""                     c.execute(sql)                     print(""committing changes"")                     connection.commit()                     print(""vacuuming..."")                     c.execute(""VACUUM"")                     print(""committing..."")                     connection.commit()                     print(""Turning journal back on (\""MEMORY\"" mode)..."")                     c.execute(""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"")                     connection.commit()                     print(""Back to loading and processing new rows!\n"")  #################################################  My end result was a DB with a filesize of 4.09GB (from the original source filesize of 54.5GB).

@josephryle4106,2017-11-30T16:33:20Z,10,"I'm adding this comment here, since this is the video where you finally add comment_id = row['name'], though it's arguably more appropriate for an earlier video.  I used BigQuery, through which I exported the collections I wanted to my Google Cloud bucket, and then saved them locally; however, I could have queried SELECT * FROM [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2017_10] to yield similar results. Instead of the wildcard, the desired columns can be listed, separated by commas. Query results, as opposed to entire collection tables, may be downloaded as JSON instead of exported.  What I noticed is that ""name"" is null in later collections, which causes a problem when attempting to assign the ""name"" element to a variable. Since ""name"" is a composite--or perhaps a portmanteau--of parent_id and id, I used this flexible workaround, as I observed the ""name"" is the first 3 characters of the parent_id combined with the id:  if row != 'name':     comment_id = parent_id[:3] + row['id'] else:     comment_id = row['name']  I'm a Python beginner, but this seems to work. Because the collections I'm using are primarily the later ones, I assume the null value for ""name"" first; however, if you're using primarily the earlier collections that have non-null names, then you should probably flip the if-else.",True
