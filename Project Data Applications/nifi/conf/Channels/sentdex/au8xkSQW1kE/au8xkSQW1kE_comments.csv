@Pkotiu9292,2021-08-24T00:03:23Z,8,"Fun fact - 'iter' is Latin for a 'walk', 'path', or 'journey'. An 'iterator' is someone/thing that actively takes steps along a path (just as a 'victor' is someone who wins), whereas a path (or in this case, a list, etc.) is 'iterable' because it can be followed but doesn't necessitate that stepwise movement (same as when you 'reiterate' something you return to the beginning and walk through it again). Anyway, great stuff, I appreciate your lack of smoke and mirrors!  EDIT: Some parallels might be ""terminator"" vs. ""terminable"" or ""negotiator"" vs. ""negotiable""",True
