I often have to grab screen shots of this mapping website then sketch them up in AutoCAD. It's an interactive street channelization map. http://web6.seattle.gov/sdot/trafficcontrolplanmap/   I thought I'd make a program that would go to the website zoomed in at a certain level and grab an area I wanted and create one large image. Right now I just do screen shots and piece them together.  I've ""inspected"" the webpage and it seems like pretty easy variables to plug in to get any location I want. But being new to programming in general i'm not sure if it's javascript that runs the interact map. I've been watching videos on PIL as well but never found a use for it until now i think.
