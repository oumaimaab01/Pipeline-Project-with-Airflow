@ixxitopololis,2017-11-08T07:27:21Z,0,"Your'e definition of the difference between flat and hierarchical is wrong. To quote ""Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective"" by Kevin P. Murphy:     ""flat clustering, also called partitional clustering, where we partition the objects into disjoint sets; and hierarchical clustering, where we create a nested tree of partitions. [...] Furthermore, _most_ hierarchical clustering algorithms are deterministic and do not require the specification of K, the number of clusters, whereas _most_ flat clustering algorithms are sensitive to the initial conditions and require some model selection method for K.""

When I perform the mean of the first column of our np.array X = np.array([[1, 2], [1.5, 1.8], [5, 8], [8, 8], [1, 0.6], [9, 11]]) which is (1 + 1.5 + 5) / 3 I get 2.5 however, my result when applying the cluster classifier is 1.16.

@maximrusakov8822,2017-01-18T21:36:49Z,0,Regarding your point of k-means versus hierarchical clustering I mean you can also use K-means with say 5-6 clusters each representing likeliness to buy an amazon product. Same idea as hierarchical clustering right? I always thought of k-means as more useful because you have centroids which you can use to train/test whereas hierarchical clustering training and testing is all done in the same step (So technically not really even machine learning),True
