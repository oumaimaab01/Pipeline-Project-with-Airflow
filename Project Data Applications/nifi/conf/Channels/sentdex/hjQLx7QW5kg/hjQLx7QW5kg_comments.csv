@YourLyricsHQ,2018-12-18T12:49:22Z,0,Wouldnt learning be a lot faster if you could set a seed for the random map generator and let the bot play the same game multiple times with obviously different random moves. This way you could just learn with the game where the highest halite was collected and you wouldnt have to care about how much halite could have been collected with a perfect bot.,True
