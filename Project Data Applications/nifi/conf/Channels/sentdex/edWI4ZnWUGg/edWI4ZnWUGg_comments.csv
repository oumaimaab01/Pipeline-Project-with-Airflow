@jhonmarshal6501,2017-05-09T23:16:03Z,0,"sentdex - is it possible to generate sloped lanes so the AI can determine what direction it's tires need to be at any given time? You could also use this to adjust for sharp turns by laying off the gas and to determine where it needs to position itself in its lane to increase constant speed and traction. Measuring the color or pattern of the lane lines may also help in better lane detection. There's a lot of math involved but this could increase the effectiveness of the AI greatly. Also traffic avoidance through vehicle recognition could determine the acceleration or velocity of traffic coming from its field of view which would also help avoid rear ending vehicles. If you can program to perceive depth you can tell how fast you are going in relation to those vehicles.  Another idea: what if the AI studied the behavior of surrounding vehicles to improve the ways that it itself works, this could be a much faster way of generating neural circuitry than the trial and error system you have set up.  You also should implement a system that helps the system more quickly learn from it's errors.  Note: I do not know how to program to this extent but I'm happy to collaborate in the format of these processes, I do have a good idea of how this would be coded I'm just not yet proficient enough in the hands on work that would need to be required.",True

@easyBob100,2017-05-09T16:21:51Z,20,"How noisy did you make the training data?  By that, I mean, did you crash into stuff, back up, and get back on the road (and other random things)?  If the model doesn't train on stuff like that, it won't know how to deal with things other than just driving on the road.  Once it goes off, it outputs junk.  Also, analog input would be better.  And while I'm commenting, more input controls to help the network generate output is good too.  Think of it like giving the network a 'goal'.  Maybe generate waypoints to drive to and use the minimap as input (so the network can ""see"" which way it needs to go).  Converting the minimap lines into an input vector would be a good input (if not really hard to do tho).  Best example would be Google's text to speech network.  When it has text to read, it sounds real, but when it doesn't, it sounds like gibberish. [/rant'n]",True
