@EzraSchroeder,2018-06-27T08:20:29Z,0,Activation has to be nonlinear not linear. Only nonlinear activations are used because otherwise neural networks wouldn't be universal approximators. Essentially they would be worthless / useless. https://youtu.be/Bc8UC_m7M_Y,True

Promise is more or less same as callback, its just that promise has (overall) a better, more readable syntax when we are having multiple promise / callback at the same time.",True

@GalHorowitz,2018-06-15T15:23:36Z,3,"A Promise is what it is - a ""promise"" when a function returns a Promise, it promises you that when you will be called things will be ready. A neat feature of working with promises is requirement stacking: For example,  getSomeImportantData().then((data, error) => {     // Handle errors     return useThatDataForAnotherPromise(data); }).then((data, error) => {     // Hooray! We are sure we have our data to use.     console.log(data); });  Do note that the ""data, error"" format is not set in stone and you will need to check the API reference for exact parameters. A promise has three resolution states:  1) Pending - Initial state. 2) Fulfilled - Represents a successful operation 3) Rejected - Failure  Other useful tips: Use Promise.all when you need data from multiple sources that do not depend on each other: Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((data) => {     // I am called when all promises resolve/reject.     // In this case, data is an array of all values returned by the promises, by order. });",True
