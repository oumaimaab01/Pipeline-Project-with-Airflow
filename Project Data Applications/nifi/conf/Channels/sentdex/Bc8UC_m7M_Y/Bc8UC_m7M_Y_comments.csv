@EzraSchroeder,2018-06-27T08:20:29Z,0,Activation has to be nonlinear not linear. Only nonlinear activations are used because otherwise neural networks wouldn't be universal approximators. Essentially they would be worthless / useless. https://youtu.be/Bc8UC_m7M_Y,True

@jimip6c12,2018-06-19T13:10:13Z,3,"Just to add on, Promise only have two categories, resolve or reject. In this case, the promise in tensorflow can help user to define a function to basically do something if the training is finished, or something else when the training is failed.  Promise is more or less same as callback, its just that promise has (overall) a better, more readable syntax when we are having multiple promise / callback at the same time.",True

@GalHorowitz,2018-06-15T15:23:36Z,3,"A Promise is what it is - a ""promise"" when a function returns a Promise, it promises you that when you will be called things will be ready. A neat feature of working with promises is requirement stacking: For example,  getSomeImportantData().then((data, error) => {     // Handle errors     return useThatDataForAnotherPromise(data); }).then((data, error) => {     // Hooray! We are sure we have our data to use.     console.log(data); });  Do note that the ""data, error"" format is not set in stone and you will need to check the API reference for exact parameters. A promise has three resolution states:  1) Pending - Initial state. 2) Fulfilled - Represents a successful operation 3) Rejected - Failure  Other useful tips: Use Promise.all when you need data from multiple sources that do not depend on each other: Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((data) => {     // I am called when all promises resolve/reject.     // In this case, data is an array of all values returned by the promises, by order. });",True
