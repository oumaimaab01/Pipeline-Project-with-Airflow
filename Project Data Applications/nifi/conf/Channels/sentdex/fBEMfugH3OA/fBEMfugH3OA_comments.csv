@skytechbits,2018-07-26T07:19:29Z,2,"Hello sentdex. You do a great job. I hope someone hired you and appreciates your passion for Python and programming in general. I have a tech background and have studied the stock market too, so I really love this and want to make it. After using a couple of editors I really prefer line numbers, one that keeps my code in proper indent order being that Python 2.7 idle yelled at me earlier today which was time consuming and annoying lol, and I need one that will allow me to raise the font size.  I'm going through your other Python course right now and then found these videos.  Would you please help me write a program that I could integrate with any editor that would allow me to raise the font size? I can't see screens like PyCharm, PyScripter.  Cntl++ are my bffs but they don't work inside the editor. One has a zoom but it doesn't do any good. I search all over in programs for the configuration to raise the font size all the time and I'm sure there are many out there who need the same solution too. I don't want to lower my resolution of course so please help me out.  I love your courses and yes you should be paid for all that you contribute. I'll be glad to contribute as soon as I have an income again and am relying on getting back into programming. I want to create several platforms (games, apps, etc) of study guides for CompTIA tests.",True
