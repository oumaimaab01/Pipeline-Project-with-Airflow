@BadGatewayMusic,2016-12-02T16:09:26Z,0,"Python is MARKEDLY slower in comparison to C++ when it comes to iteration. Vectorized operations are just as fast if you're doing them in Numpy, that is true, but basic looping is several orders of magnitude slower in Python. Also, it's not always possible to vectorize your operations so C++ has considerable advantages in certain contexts. Perhaps there is a Python library (not talking about Cython) that gets around this, if anyone could tell me that would be awesome.",True

I can make Pandas work for me in that setting. I also then found your machine learning algorithms using SVM for stocks.   I am looking to do something similar but using MLPs but there's a few aspects I am struggling with. I wondered if you had any suggestions and can comment on whether this series will cover the Pandas aspect? 1) I have FOREX data on minute-by-minute data. If I want the open(O)/high(H)/low(L)/close(C) on different time scales, I can get that easy enough e.g. on 10/30/60 min scales. However, I cannot tag the minute-wise data with the higher OHLC  groups that it belongs to – I get single values every 10 minutes and NaN for the other 9. Basically, I would like to know the OHLC that my 1 minute data belongs to for all the larger temporal blocks, all in 1 dataframe. Do you know the Pandas feature for this and will you be covering it (or covered elsewhere)? 2) Do you know of a good ML library for MLPs? Scikit doesn't include proper supervised learning yet and pybrain is slow beyond belief. Atm I build in Matlab (30 mins instead of days) and I think I will just rebuild the net in Python using raw values for weights and activation functions. This is cumbersome...
