@m0nk3y60,2017-08-08T13:04:04Z,0,"I started learning Python from his videos, and I still watch his videos. Sentdex is one of the best* tutors for Python programming language on YouTube in 2015, 2016, and now in 2017. He is really good, skillful, he is on top of variety of subjects. Sentdex isn't rude, and I don't think I heard him badmouth. Thank you Harrison. You are doing a good deed as well. I personally think that Sentdex is vital for Python programming language, as I started my learning from his videos. However, I can't honestly recommend just one tutor. I recommend to watch CS50, MIT, newBoston, more Sentdex, and many others, with best regards.",True
