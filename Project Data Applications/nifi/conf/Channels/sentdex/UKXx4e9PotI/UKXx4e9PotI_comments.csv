@djleisheng,2018-02-19T20:05:08Z,0,"I highly recommend everyone to use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to manage your Python.  From my experience with Ubuntu, it is incredibly difficult to get pip working and also Ubuntu comes with a version of Python preinstalled which is tailored to the operating system's needs, and some parts of the operating system depend on Python, so you really don't want to mess with it and have to reinstall your OS.  It's handy on Windows too.  It creates a virtual environment where you can install various versions of Python and you just attach it to a specific folder where your project is, and it installs a completely isolated copy of Python, pip, wheel, setuptools and you never have to worry about it interfering with the setup of any of your other projects or Ubuntu's default python installation.
