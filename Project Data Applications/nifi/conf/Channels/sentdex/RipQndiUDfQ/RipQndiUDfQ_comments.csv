The icon was made using an online pixel editor, default transparent backgrounds don't work so I decided to install gimp but, the same problem occurs; either the image is oddly colored or the image is a block of black pixels in a square.  I've followed you're/sentdex's example when changing the background for all versions for all sizes: 32,16 and above, can anyone  help? it does display but not as it should, also I checked to make sure I'm using the same settings as in the example and still nothing.",True
