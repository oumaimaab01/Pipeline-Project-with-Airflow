@xXMockapapellaXx,2018-04-16T02:07:15Z,0,"OK so I've had this idea for a few years now, and I think it actually seems relevant here.  Start off by giving a program the basic operations of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Then, have it perform random operations. When it discovers a new operation such as ""Square root"" or ""multiplying a number to the power of something"", it incorporates it into it's toolbox of operations it can perform.  Can this sort of set-up be created with the information being taught in this series?",True

@bartoszpaternoga5522,2018-04-15T15:18:04Z,0,"Hello Harrison. I am afraid your video is misleading, if not incorrect. You have made ""Addition as a Mapping Problem - the beginner’s mistake"" . Please refer to proper way to do it as explain in the post below: https://machinelearningmastery.com/learn-add-numbers-seq2seq-recurrent-neural-networks/  ""The problem we have solved had multiple inputs but was technically not a sequence prediction problem. In fact, you can just as easily solve it using a multilayer Perceptron (MLP).""  ""Addition as a Sequence Prediction Problem There is another way to frame addition that makes it an unambiguous sequence prediction problem, and in turn makes it much harder to solve.  We can frame addition as an input and output string of characters and let the model figure out the meaning of the characters. The entire addition problem can be framed as a string of characters, such as “12+50” with the output “62”, or more specifically:  Input: [‘1’, ‘2’, ‘+’, ‘5’, ‘0’] Output: [‘6’, ‘2’]  The model must learn not only the integer nature of the characters, but also the nature of the mathematical operation to perform.  Notice how sequence is now important, and that randomly shuffling the input will create a nonsense sequence that could not be related to the output sequence.  Also notice how the problem has transformed to have both an input and an output sequence. This is called a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, or a seq2seq problem.  We can keep things simple with addition of two numbers, but we can see how this may be scaled to a variable number of terms and mathematical operations that could be given as input for the model to learn and generalize.""",True
