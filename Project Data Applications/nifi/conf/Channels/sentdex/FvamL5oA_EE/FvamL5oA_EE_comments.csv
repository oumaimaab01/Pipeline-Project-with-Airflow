@spicytuna08,2018-09-18T05:13:38Z,0,great tutorial not only python data analysis but actual discussion on what those stats number mean. i was wondering how would you display the same graph on the web.  do you have a tutorial on displaying results on the web?,True
@varunvermaendless,2018-08-19T06:22:57Z,8,"Hi,  Instead of Upsampling to Day and then again Down Sampling to Month. Resample has been updated with ""pad"" now. I used this line instead of the  two lines: df = df.resample('M').pad()  You have awesome content in your channel. :)",True
@mozarter86,2018-07-27T17:16:37Z,0,"one question: when using   state_HPI_M30.corr()['M30'].describe()  to get the statistics values, it also calculate the itself column (M30 here), right? Then the itself column value, which is definitely 1,  will affect the average mean, variance and other values. Do we need to get rid of it?",True

@ORagnar,2018-02-24T01:06:18Z,0,"6:13 Funny, my resampling gives me values. I see no NaNs.       The only difference in the data is that my values, as acquired from Quandl, are divided by 10,000 for some reason. 2/23/18",True

@mikedonohue9444,2017-08-23T05:51:39Z,0,"In the .describe() operation on the 'M30' column, it appears that the analysis is using the 1.000 value of the correlation of M30 with M30 (i.e., the 51st data value) in the calculation of the mean, std, etc.  I believe that this value should be deleted before any statistics are generated from the data set.",True
@bobwrotenstien315,2017-08-06T20:30:17Z,0,"I grabbed the weekly FMAC 30yr mortgage data from Quandl since that is all I could find, and resampled it to monthly data, and was surprised to see how different the M30 correlation was between my results and the videos .. .... somewhere around 5 points lower..... ie a  -.79 on this video for M30 to a state would be .-74.  I wonder if that is because I resampled the data differently to get to month, or if the data was different to begin with.",True
