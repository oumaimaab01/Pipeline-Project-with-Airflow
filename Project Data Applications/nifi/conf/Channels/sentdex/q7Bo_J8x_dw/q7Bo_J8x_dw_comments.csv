@ridhwanulhaque8230,2016-08-20T07:44:38Z,0,"Thanks for the great tutorial. I had some questions, one is that is possible to read coordinates from the line graph, say for example the x and y coordinates that i provided was [1,2,3,4,10] and [10, 20, 30, 40, 100] and then I want python to find what x would be if y was 60 from the line chart, is that possible? another question that I had was that to have the x-axis at different scale, say for example fist it would have 10 to 1 and then it would be to 0.1 and it would be to 0.001? Please tell me if its possible, if not with matplotlib with any other libraries. I will be waiting for your response.",True

@l1ghtange,2016-05-27T14:21:41Z,1,"Thanks so much for your vids. They've been very helpful.  I have a question concerning some theory of matplotlib.  What are the differences and relationships between figure objects and axes objects?  Many times, it's possible to achieve the same thing only via a different mean. e.g set the label of x-axes. I could do that the axes object: ax.set_xlabel(' Distance (m)')  or I can do that via plt.xlabel('Distance(m)'). I hope my question makes sense.  Once again thanks for all your videos.",True
@Steve-de8kk,2016-05-25T00:09:42Z,0,The first thing for newbies is to find and install setup tools off of the matplotlib site .. Matplotlib website  doesn't  have an .exe file anymore .. after setuptools is installed ..then use the cmd commands for pip install matplotlib,True

@legendofmars889,2016-02-08T01:04:41Z,0,I had the older version and then I decided to get the 3.5 python. and it took me a long while just to get the IDLE haha. And was taking the steps as shown but was having a hard time again bc I guess the cite changed. and after some reading around the cite I read that it is easier to get the Anaconda- because it comes with matplotlib and various other modules. and now I am able to replicate the small graph and hopefully everything else you will show in these next videos :) Also very good presentation skills!,True

@greatsea,2016-01-11T05:42:37Z,0,'pip install matplotlib' generated all kinds of errors towards the end of the install.  It is amazing to me that in 2016 this issue with windows has not been worked out yet.  Utterly ridiculous!  I've had success with Anaconda a few years ago but dammit i want to just be able to get matplotlib touch and go and import it into IDLE.  Anaconda actually hijacks some of the environment functionality of original python install.  basically it breaks it to some degree.  I applaud the iPython project.  It is fantastic but there has to be a way to make it easier to use Matplotlib on a windows platform that can be setup in a standard Python fashion.,True
