I'm a retired SE and just a few months ago had to jump back in just to play with the new toys! I'm not only using them to generate code in various languages but SQA, Test harnesses, refactoring, and as a tutor on ML and data science. What a time to be alive. I love your teaching style.",True

@sidewinder3422,2018-04-07T07:33:33Z,1,"Hi, I'm kinda new to your channel and I would like to ask, do you also seriously study the fundamental and theoretical stuff of machine learning and data analysis like the algorithms and mathematics? Because im always reluctant to do ml and data analysis because i always think that my theoretical and mathematical knowledge  is lacking to do meaningful stuff or I dont have much control on it,  I end up focusing too much on books about it but it takes time to digest concepts,  I always think about I need to be good at statistics, linear algebra, etc first. before I jump in.",True

@trollamos,2018-04-06T15:31:21Z,0,"My dude, Markov chains can be generative too! A discriminatory model classifies (or scores, really), a generative generates. Anyway, wanted to link to MTG card generation, some pretty interesting results by the end https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/custom-card-creation/612057-generating-magic-cards-using-deep-recurrent-neural . One of the tricks to increase coherence, at the cost of creativity, is to replace groups of characters with a symbol. Interesting stuff.",True

@FatihKarakuzu,2018-04-05T23:48:31Z,2,"Heay sentdex, i read the comments and just found 1 that says to get rid of comments. I think thats a great idea but not because of the opening and closing of comments.   Code in general is like a hard rulebook but comments are way more ""messy"" than code. In comments is to much variation cause of natural language. If you would got rid of it then you would have mostly hard ruled language except of variablenames.   I think thats way more effective to learn and train a NN like this.   Love the videos you do so keep up man.",True

@kuXShortguy,2018-04-05T18:46:25Z,2,"Okey so I trained this one Harry Potter and 50 shades of grey. The input just had the harry potter book and then 50 shades right after, which is not the best way to train. But that was for fast testing. The result, stupid sentences with a generous dash of gibberish. However I have fun reading it haha.",True
