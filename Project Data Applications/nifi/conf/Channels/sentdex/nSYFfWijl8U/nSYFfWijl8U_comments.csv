@RX7GSLSEowner,2020-01-09T17:35:21Z,0,"Go doesn't impose styles?  Funny, but coming from an old-school C/C++ perspective it absolutely does.  Glad that they don't go any further with it like Python does (shudder).  And I loathe the requirement to put your opening braces on the same line as your function declaration or if statement.  And don't get me started on ""} else {"".  Then the multiple import business.  Egad.  Learning Go because I have to, BTW, just as a data-point feedback for you.  I'd continue with C/C++ if given the choice.  Anyway, good tutorial, thanks.  And all of these ""package""s ... reminds me of Ada.",True

@chrismccullough2607,2019-07-08T20:00:54Z,1,"@Sentdex, the current program you wrote for random numbers will produce the same number every time (81). You need to add a line defining the seed above your line with rand.Intn, if you want to have pseudo-random numbers. Such as:   rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())  -- note: this requires the ""time"" package to be imported   See the following links for more details:   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39529364/go-rand-intn-same-number-value#answer-39529428   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8288679/difficulty-with-go-rand-package#answer-8288765",True

@randydiaz7664,2018-10-21T16:30:06Z,11,This is my second time watching this playlist!   I already built static webpages and simple sites/applications with Go.  The benefits of Go are like programming with Bumper Guards in bowling. It won't let you mess anything up because of it's intense error handling during compiling. Also it is so simple to just make a systemd task on linux server and run with nginx.   I am now ready to really master the concepts of Interfaces and Concurrency.,True
