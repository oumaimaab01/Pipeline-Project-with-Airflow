Normally you know about how we plot 3D bar in a map. so my request is: for example I have my private image (instead of the map) and I want to plot the 3D bar upon my private image, where I want to put the image in the plan (OXY) and then I make the 3D bar upon the appropriate coordinate in my image. So do you have any solution or idea how I can do this kind of plot. And thank you so much for help.",True
