@carbon13,2017-04-11T10:26:14Z,1,"Just a quick note: The array of array thing makes more sense in C++, as most of the functions returned cv::Mat, a 2D array. So the output of HoughLines was a n x 1 array (where n is the number of lines), but the datatype was cv::Vector2f (a struct of two floats). As the Python version is just a wrapper, it still makes sense to return in the same format.",True
@MarkJay,2017-04-11T06:24:41Z,20,have you tried preprocessing with a blur filter before the canny edge function? the cv2.BilateralFilter is a good choice because it preserves edges while smoothing out irregularities. It can be a bit cpu intensive though.,True
