Like someone else has commented, use sorted(lstName) if you don't want to mutate lstName. sorted() also accepts the reverse parameter as well. If you just want to display the list backwards, not sorting the values, use lstName.reverse().  On another aside, for index, you can have optional parameters specifying what range to search in a list which reduces the searching time. The general form is lstName.index(value, inc_start, exc_end) where value is the value/search key you are looking for, inc_start is the inclusive starting search position, and exc_start is the exclusive ending search position.",True

@curstinvisagie7689,2016-10-25T19:28:36Z,0,"Hello :) Can someone help me please ? what is the code for adding whatever names a person types that will be added to the list after the program is executed ? In other words, i created a program that asks for your name, and it will keep on asking until you type in John, but i want the program to print out all the names you typed before you typed John.  So far the coding is   name = 'Curstin' while name != 'John':  name = raw_input('Enter your name: ')  Incorrect_Names = [] Incorrect_Names.append(name) print Incorrect_Names  When you run it, it continually asks for your name but when you type in John, the list remains empty and none of the previous names are added to the list.  If I'm not making any sense, here is the question for my assignment :  Write a python program that takes the user input as a string. While the string is not 'John', add every string entered into a list until 'John' is entered. Then print out the list. The program should store all incorrect strings into a list in which 'John' is the only correct string.  PLease respond ASAP and thank you !!!!",True
