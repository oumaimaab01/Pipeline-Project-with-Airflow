@hmousavi79,2019-11-01T19:42:41Z,0,"Thanks for the nice tutorial. Quick question: I'm dynamically updating a table, based on twitter feed, that can hold about 1000 rows at a time (without pagination). and I'm updating this table once in 10 seconds, or so. Somehow it takes forever with dash to update the table. My browser even freezes at times. I'm using dash builtin webserver. Would you say by moving to apache and wsgi, I might see a performance boost?, or deploying is just for releasing to production server, and perhaps security reasons. Thanks!",True
