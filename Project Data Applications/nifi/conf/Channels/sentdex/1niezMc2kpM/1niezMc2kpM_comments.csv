@toastrecon,2018-11-13T23:12:48Z,11,"I'm excited to see this series. Makes me wonder if or how you could link or interrelate these AI's to each other. Like have and train an AI for gathering, one for hunting and attacking, one for finding a good place to build another depot, and then use those to train another ""hyper-AI"" to control them, which would know when to spawn more, what mode to put each of them into, assign them to a depot, implement some kind of aggression strategy etc... Maybe that would quickly get to be very large computationally.",True
