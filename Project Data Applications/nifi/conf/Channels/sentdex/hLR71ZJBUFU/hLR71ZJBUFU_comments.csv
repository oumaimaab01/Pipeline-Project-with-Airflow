@jcf3300,2017-08-02T06:18:39Z,0,"Problem: sometimes when I repeatedly refresh my follow along site, it reverts back to previous versions. In other words, I'll lose updates that I made to my main.html file, so that it looks more like what I did along the lines of tutorial 4 or 5 instead of 6. For instance, after embedding the videos, they appeared on the site a few times, but then after a couple of refreshes they disappeared. Does my problem description make sense? If so, has anyone else experienced this and/or perhaps have an idea as to how to fix it?",True

@khalilzakariazemmoura8995,2017-01-11T15:14:21Z,0,"Hi sentdex, Thanks for your very good tutorial, i have some questions about the html your wrote. Why you put the <header> tag out of the body? is there any benefit for that?  Why you just didn't use:  <body>     <header>         ...     </header>     ... </body>  since you put the header out of the body tag and the content of your tutorial in the body tag. And thanks for the tip of the min-height css property. i was looking for how to do that.",True
