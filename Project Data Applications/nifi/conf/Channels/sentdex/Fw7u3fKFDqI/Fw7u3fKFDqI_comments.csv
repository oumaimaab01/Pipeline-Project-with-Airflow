@NisseHult101,2016-11-09T20:54:19Z,0,"Nice tutorial series. It used to be the case that one could often trade memory use for execution speed, i.e. to use more memory to make the program run faster, but nowadays with modern CPUs the large cache-sizes can play surprising tricks on you, so this is not necessarily true anymore. Sometimes it can be (much) more important to make the data being worked on fit into a smaller memory footprint (x times the cache line size) for faster execution. Essentially, one should always measure to see which is faster.",True
@AdamBecker80,2016-11-09T19:06:49Z,0,"Hey Harrison, you probably are already aware of this but I thought it was worth a comment.  The reason for the last generator in your example running faster than the list comprehension is likely due to the fact that the memory did not need to be allocated for it.  Allocating large amounts of memory can at times be costly but more importantly inconsistent.  In my tests, I found that using the generator would yield consistent results whereas the list comprehension would usually be faster but the time would fluctuate much more, occasionally running more slowly.",True
