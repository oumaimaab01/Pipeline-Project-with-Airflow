@astralexplorer7674,2021-08-26T11:24:46Z,2,Can you please do more Golang Tutorials. Intermediate Level ones?,True
@sc0820,2021-07-13T16:41:37Z,0,the video is very useful to me. It provides me another perspective when I look back to python as a go-programmer.,True
@dp8579,2020-10-30T13:14:12Z,0,"@sentdex  Is there a way to create a common receiver function on two struct having different names but same attributes? say,  type Student struct{       name string }  type Teacher struct{       name string }  to display name, we try  func (s Student) DisplayName(){ // this is for Student     fmt.Println(s.name) }  func (s Student) DisplayName(){   // this is for Teacher     fmt.Println(s.name) } In  main() we will do like, create a instance of each struct, then  <instance_for_Student>.DisplayName() <instance_for_Teacher>.DisplayName()   // < > just for notations  Just above two receiver method needed to write, Can we make a receiver method for both?   Please share thoughts",True
@boots3372,2020-07-10T13:17:58Z,5,I love this format. To the point. This is a tutorial for programmers. There are enough tutorials out there for non-programmers. Great work.,True
@srinivasreddy9206,2020-06-20T09:09:51Z,0,what's the difference between func (c car) kmh()  and func kmh(c car),True
@JaehoonMe,2020-05-09T22:38:11Z,0,Thank you!,True
@DrSpooglemon,2020-03-30T12:05:28Z,2,"Like the say in the hood, ""Mo classes, mo problem.""  It kind of makes me feel uncomfortable actually, that there are no classes in Go. I've only just got my head around OOP in Python and I was already a bit uneasy trying to learn about objects in Javascript. Life is full of these kinds of twists and turns tho. I will overcome. :P",True
@HaileeMiu,2019-02-07T13:44:46Z,17,Why are people so mean? This is a multiple part series from a person that does a Python channel. He is helping out his main audience. I personally only know Javascript and am following along just fine (because I am watching ALL the videos). I think the level of info is perfect for my personal experience level because it gives me the first taste + working code that I can play around with on my own (hint hint). As well as giving me terms and ideas to go research on my own when I don't understand. Also sentdex is very responsive in the comments if you have specific questions.,True
@djsamke384,2018-12-20T23:22:54Z,0,"Bro so how do you use say one scripts, with a struct and its methods, in another script. Basically encapsulation?",True
@djsamke384,2018-12-20T23:18:47Z,0,You seem like a very passionate guy bro. And this tut was fine. I understood everything perfectly. Ignore these fools that are talking shit. I guess Go is not for beginners and they should just quite now! Thanks again for the tuts bro.,True
@ninipppe,2018-10-25T16:39:35Z,0,4:24,True
@randixlai9216,2018-07-23T07:23:49Z,0,I understand python . but I don't understand this tutorial. You're rushing through it I don't understand what const mean and what func (c car)kmh()float64 does.,True
@ruhruhruhruhruheisjsij,2018-06-12T21:49:08Z,1,"This isnt a tutorial, this is just you running through code quickly without explaning anything... good job, you just wasted my time. Back to the docs",True
@retrospectacus,2018-04-30T22:34:52Z,0,Keep it DRY! func (c car) mph() float64 { return c.kmh() / kmh_multiple },True
@Locationary,2018-03-25T11:34:38Z,8,You should spend more time explaining the code instead of rushing through it for example you didn't explain why you would write func(c car) kmh()  and not func kmh()(c car). I think the main problem is with your videos you assume people have a python background and already know much of the layout of the code.,True
@keithandrelashley,2017-10-31T13:00:44Z,0,Hello Sendex I have just started Golang.  I am working on getting gomobile connected to my android SDK.. I haven't found a lot of video tutorials on gomobile. Do you think you could do one similar to your Kivy tutorials in the near future?  I like your content it's very good.,True
@ihsancemilcicek2785,2017-10-27T05:01:47Z,0,"First time I heard that value receiver, pointer receiver. They basicly same anyway :D",True
@stjepanbrkic3215,2017-10-26T17:57:38Z,7,"""its so simple, it doesn't even exist"" ahhh :)",True
@igorgomonov2253,2017-10-23T19:45:47Z,1,"Thank you for your tutorials. They are so clearly. If you have  more advanced golang cources in any of educational platforms (Udemy,Courcera etc) I want to get them! Keep do such a great lessons and tutorials.",True
@BDYH-ey8kd,2017-10-23T16:07:41Z,1,Stay fluffy sentdex (>^_____^<),True
