@Anas-gu2qg,2018-12-29T15:16:02Z,0,"When I used the code below to create the label column :  housing_data['label'] = list(map(create_labels_housing_data['United States'], housing_data['US_HPI_Future'])).  it returned the following error : TypeError: 'list' object is not callable  Could anyone explain to me why I had this error please ? It seems like nobody else encountered a similar error.  I had to use the following code to create the label column instead :   housing_data['label'] = np.nan  for i in range(len(housing_data)):     housing_data['label'][i] = create_labels(housing_data['United States'][i], housing_data['US_HPI_future'][i])",True
@prempotabatti7615,2018-12-15T12:54:38Z,0,"why didn't you just call creat_labels(housing_data[""United States""], housing_data[""US_HPI_Future""]).. what is the necessity of mapping? It looks like it is doing the same job.",True

@alimirzaeyan3637,2017-12-29T21:01:10Z,0,"Hi, is there any way to define Stride for rolling_window ?  it is just using Stride = 1, because the window move forward only one step each time, what if I want to have a bigger step forward ?",True
@bardeeaaaa,2017-09-20T17:17:14Z,1,A bit confused: the .pct_change function already returns a pandas series that calculates the change in HPI from one data point to the next.  So why are you then creating the  USA_HPI_future column?  Isn't that unnecessary?,True

@Thepando20,2017-05-07T20:59:05Z,2,Thanks for your videos man! keep doing a great job pls :D,True
@EvilSpeculator,2017-04-16T11:39:47Z,1,AWESOME tutorial series. I just recently started to learn Python and basically wrote a parser to produce sparse lists for an SVM in C# two years ago. Took me two weeks and another two to get all the bugs out. In python with pandas and numpy this would have been a one day affaire. I don't think I had this much fun learning a new language since I started with Java in 1996.,True
@michaelpower6280,2017-04-02T05:37:58Z,1,"So this has been a very useful tutorial. So I want to start by thanking you.  My question is about the logic of the code rather than the writing.  If we are trying to test if the HPI increases or decreases, and our data is already formatted to percent change, Wouldn't the best way to do this be testing if future HPI is positive or negative.",True
@theycallmemorphine,2016-12-21T08:09:05Z,0,"Hey Harrison, I've been following this tutorial series in Python 2.7 and I've tried to change the moving_average function as this one not gonna work on mine..  def moving_average(values):     val = values.describe()['mean']     return val  Even by doing this, an error comes up...   File ""rollingApply.py"", line 19, in moving_average     val = values.describe()['mean'] AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'describe'  Please help me out... I'll be waiting for your reply.",True
@petrolbears,2015-11-11T10:24:12Z,5,"Hi Harrison,  You can stick to pandas instead of passing a mapped list by using horizontal apply and lambda:  housing_data['label'] = housing_data.apply(lambda row: 1 if row['US_HPI_future'] > row['United States'] else 0, axis=1)",True
@mra1385,2015-11-05T16:32:05Z,1,"Hi. Thanks for your videos. I' watch them all the time. I had a question about ~14:19 where you write:  housing_data['label'] = list(map(create_labels_housing_data['United States'], housing_data['US_HPI_Future'])).   I was curious if you did it this way instead of the more common Series.map() because that's the only way to pass multiple columns into the function that you're applying/mapping?",True
