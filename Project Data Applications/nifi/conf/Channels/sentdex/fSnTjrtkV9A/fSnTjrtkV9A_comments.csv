@RicksterLuna,2018-03-05T00:32:36Z,0,These have been very helpful tutorials as I am new to python. I've always embraced object oriented programming and would p like to learn more from your examples despite the fact that you've expressed otherwise. I hope that you continue to show us simple tips and tricks and that you continue to update your videos and playlist. They've been a massive help!,True

@dmcg7900,2017-09-23T02:47:01Z,0,"The best way to handle a X close event is to customize the built in closeEvent method of the QWidget, QMainWindow etc classes.  Thus we can reimplement (overwrite) the method anywhere after our __init__() method like so:  def __init__(self):         super(Window, self).__init__()         self.setGeometry(50, 50, 500, 300)         .         .         .  def closeEvent(self, event):         self.close_application()   Simple as that!  Remember it works because closeEvent is built into the QWidget classes so redefining it redirects the event to whatever we like.",True

@dinnyrandom4006,2015-05-31T16:43:34Z,0,Nice Tutorial! Found this while searching for a good gui module for me. It seems the best so far but at the Moment i have one big question in my mind. How do I do stuff in the background? I'm learning Python in school and have a bit of an understanding what Python is. I could do it in a seperat thread but it semms wrong to outsource such small pieces of code.  I'm developing a Server/Client tool. They are connected over a SSL secured socket. The client gets data and has to interpret it as well as display some of the stuff.  I hope you can solve this Problem in a Video in the next few days or give me a hint I can search for.,True
