@toastrecon,2018-11-06T23:27:04Z,0,"Not sure, but I can't seem to get logging working on my Mac. The game does indeed produce logs, but they're limited to internal messages. Even the ""Successfully created bot!"" log from the MyBot.py doesn't seem to be logged. The games seem to execute fine, with no errors in the Terminal window. Any ideas?",True

@Alex4n3r,2018-10-18T14:35:13Z,5,"Interesting! The rules don't state that moving around costs halite. So when you do if ship.is_full: do dropoff it won't do it in the next turn but collect halite. So one needs another list of ship ids to care for their drop off. Also Direction.North is (0,-1), East is (1,0). The game isn't difficult but implementing small functions is a pain in the ass.",True
@Reventonn134,2018-10-18T14:16:44Z,5,"Hey @sentdex I was thinking about finally getting into your playlist on machine learning but I'm afraid the knowledge might be partially outdated. You even mentioned yourself in one of your streams that books about machine learning aren't worth it, because the field changes so frequently :P would you say that the playlist is still fine and I can learn from it or the opposite? And if the latter, are you planning any updates? Same goes for some other playlists. Thanks for your response in advance, I love your videos and maybe one day I will stop procrastinating and actually start creating xdd much love! <3",True
