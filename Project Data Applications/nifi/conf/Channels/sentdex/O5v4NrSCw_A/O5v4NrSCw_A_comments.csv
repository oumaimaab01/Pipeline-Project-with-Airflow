@Darthdeedee91,2016-08-26T02:34:28Z,0,so basically this resampling feature only works on indexes where it is a time value? In this case it is a month? or does A really mean the last 12 pieces of info,True
@HarshSethia,2016-02-14T10:35:44Z,0,"Thanks for the video. Can fillna take in a function. Also, how can I selectively fill the rows using an argument. For example if in the Titanic dataset I want to fill the NA values based on the mean of their name title ""Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master"" ?",True
