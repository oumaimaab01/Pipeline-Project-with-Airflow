@ManulaAlahakoon,2024-03-10T05:45:05Z,0,"This is not going to work anymore. Because  Locations inside <loc> tags are not xml sites (Not end with .xml). The url inside it directly take us to the webpage related to that news but not to the related xml. So instead of using Sitemapindex struct to perform http.Get(Location) and tring to unmarshal that data to News struct , just directly Unmarshal the xml site in to News struct.  Try this ✌  package main  import (""fmt"" ""net/http"" ""io"" ""encoding/xml"" ) /* type Sitemapindex struct { 	Locations []string `xml:""url>loc""` } */ type News struct { 	Titles []string `xml:""url>news>title""` 	Dates []string `xml:""url>news>publication_date""` 	Locations []string `xml:""url>loc""` }  type NewsMap struct { 	Date string 	Location string }  func main() { 	//var s Sitemapindex 	var n News 	news_map := make(map[string]NewsMap)  	resp, _ := http.Get(""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news-world-sitemap.xml"") 	bytes, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body) 	//resp.Body.Close() 	xml.Unmarshal(bytes, &n) 	          for idx,_ := range n.Locations{ 				news_map[n.Titles[idx]] = NewsMap{n.Dates[idx],n.Locations[idx]} 			}   	for id, data := range news_map { 		fmt.Println(""\nTitle = "",id) 		fmt.Println(""\nLocation = "",data.Location) 		fmt.Println(""\nDate = "",data.Date) 	} }",True

@darpananeja6755,2022-02-23T04:40:36Z,1,"I am not getting any ""body"" in response from the Locations so my map is always empty. I wonder why is that? Anybody else facing the same issue? Update: Okay I get it after comparing the XML file from the video to that of today's. I guess WashingtonPost has upgraded its file design and now its not accessible easily that's why the response is empty. This is what I am trying to say -  ![CDATA[ Robinson scores 26 to lead Fresno St. past Air Force 65-40 ]] This is how the title and keywords are written in today's xml file rather that simply written like before. Can anyone tell us what is this? And does it make data inaccessible?",True
@olasunkanmiolayinka9990,2020-11-21T06:19:50Z,0,"So it tried including *_urlset_* for the News struct but didn't work why? like below. *«Keywords  []string `xml:""*_urlset_*>url>news>keywords""`»*",True
@arghyadeepdas2585,2020-09-26T21:10:51Z,0,"I checked lengths of n.Titles, n.Keywords and n.Locations. Length of locations and titles is same. However, keywords are missing in some links. Now what this does is that xml.Unmarshal(bytes, &n) creates list of lesser length for keywords and equal length lists for locations and titles. How will I handle this? I need to put maybe like """" for keywords where it doesn't exist, but Unmarshal() isn't allowing that to happen. How do I fix this?",True
@rahulmysore23,2020-06-21T20:33:38Z,0,"For some reason I feel like we need to use location as the key, Title can be same or repeated but the location can't? IDK, just thinking.",True

@BoyanBonev00,2018-03-04T13:27:24Z,1,Amazing tutorials. Really glad that I found them. A slight suggestion - I found using only one struct (News) for both handling the news and the hash map much easier to understand. https://pastebin.com/JY5pwhC7,True
