We check if len(full_msg) - HEADERSIZE == msglen. First of all, shouldn't we check if greater equal, since we cannot guarantee to always read exactly msglen bytes? And more importantly, if we read more than msglen bytes, why does it not mess up the message parsing? In my program I had a HEADERSIZE of 12 and messages that were 60 bytes long. I read the messages in 16 byte chunks in the receive loop.  By the time I have read a message I will also have read a couple bytes from the next message. How does that not break the program? I don't understand. Could someone explain that to me? Thank you very much for the great tutorial! It helped me a lot!",True

@christopherh7918,2020-09-23T21:42:16Z,0,"Great video. The way how you implemented the method to get a message via header and msg length is not working however if new strings are sent every few milliseconds. On my second machine, it leads the msg to grow infinitely and never enter the == condition. This code fixed it for me if anyone has also use case with low latency applications. I simply receive only the header first because I know its length (in my case 10). Then I fetch exactly the msg length. Even if there is already a queue of strings in the socket waiting to be fetched, this method gets the messages reliably.          while True:                              full_msg = '''             msglen = 0             new_msg = True             while True:                                                 if new_msg:                     msg = self.clientsocket.recv(10)                     msglen = int(msg)                     new_msg = False                 else :                     msg = self.clientsocket.recv(msglen)                     #full_msg = msg.decode(""utf-8"")                     #print(full_msg)                                         new_msg = True",True

The graph is resized in 64*48 pixel, and I followed your tutorial, putting socket connection and pickle under a while loop, but the connection is poor as Exceptions as ""pickle data was truncated"" and ""invalid load key, '\x16'"" are raised. Do you know how come with it? and any suggestions on my project? Thanks a lot.",True
@bonbonpony,2019-09-24T03:27:44Z,0,"05:12 Not really ;) Because you're still sending the old message instead of the new one ;) 05:35 Actually, the thing inside the brackets can be any Python expression whatsoever. Mind-Blown ;J  This includes the brackets, which are irrelevant in this case. It would work without them too. 06:32 And then you change the header size and you will wonder why it broke ;)  I'd rather used `HEADERSIZE + something` here. 07:35 Hahah kinda ironic, considering that it was supposed to help people remember it :J  I bet that's how most fancy characters in Perl started... :q 08:48 I wonder what would happen if someone has sent a forged  message to the client with message length not containing numbers ;> Aaaanyway.... I see that you basically made a state machine with quite a convoluted spaghetti code. I'm pretty sure this code will start getting messier when you try some more complex protocols, such as HTTP. I tried that too, with a similar approach to yours, but it ended up being very messy, and buggy, before I was even able to parse the response correctly, because I needed a couple of nested states to handle the figuring out where the particular lines in the header end, and then where the entire header ends (with an empty line), and to collect all the pieces of a line that has been split into two separate portions of data, each of them being buffer-length long :P  And of course I had to keep track whether I'm still in the header, or already in the payload, in order to redirect the rest of the data to the proper target variable. Then I said to myself: ""Naah, this doesn't look like the Python way of doing this :P ""  and I started thinking on how to do that with generators, `yield` & stuff, so that the generator would consume the next portion of data when needed, and returned subsequent complete _lines_ to the client. In a similar way, another generator that wraps it would collect the entire HTTP header and return that to the client, while not messing up the remaining part of the underlying buffer that still contains the payload after the header, so that the next generator could consume that. I think this approach would work much nicer, and it wouldn't require waiting for the entire message to complete before processing it.",True

@alhadinon,2019-03-13T06:22:17Z,1,"Hi sentdex, Nice tutorial! There is one thing many coders on youtube do not get. And this is efficient coding. I do not know in which order you prepare your videos (text before video, or the other way round), but in some cases your code lacks a bit of perfection. For example, as you were printing the length of the message, and then converting it right after it again, with a little help of copy and paste. Imho we all want to be good coders at least, but being efficient coders should be the desired goal in the end. 😊 Don't get me wrong sentdex, I really love watching your tutorials, because they help me getting a better Python coder. And I am on the way of perfecting it day by day. Anyways, keep on going, you're awesome! 😁",True
