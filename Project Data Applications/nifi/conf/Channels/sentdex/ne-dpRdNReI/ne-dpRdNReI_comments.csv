@sedovale7698,2022-05-21T23:15:39Z,29,"The fact is Bitcoin is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is right time to invest? Before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. For the past few days the price of Bit coin has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can’t tell if it is going bearish or bullish. While others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. It all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. I would say trading has been going smoothly for me, i started with 1.5 bit coin and I’ve accumulated over 6.5 bit coin in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Thierry Veilleux. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on Tele-gr:am (@Thierry_Veilleux22) cheers",True
