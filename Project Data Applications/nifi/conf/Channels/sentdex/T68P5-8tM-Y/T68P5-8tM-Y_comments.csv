So instead of saying: ""Peter kissed Sarah"", you could say ""Sarah kissed Peter"". I understand that people use nltk to change words to substitute synonyms in place of existing words based on the wup_similarity score but overall the text should remind fairly the same unless nltk can be used to change the structure of the sentences hence I fail to see how people can use it to automatically change an essay / news article and make it totally dissimilar to the one that has already been written.",True
