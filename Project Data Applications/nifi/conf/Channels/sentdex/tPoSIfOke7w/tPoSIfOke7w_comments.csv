@thegreat8077,2018-07-21T15:40:57Z,0,"I have doubt 1. Is it necessary that we use third-party tools like Google API for running that jQuery stuff  2. When I added that ""//ajax.googleapis.com/aj..."" script, it started showing advertisements on my website but not on yours. Why? Are those ads because of the script or from my host --> pythonanywhere.com  3. Since that Google's jQuery CDN was bombarding me with ads, I used <script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.0.min.js""></script>  Good news is --> drop-down worked and no ads  Bad news is --> can't get the advantages of Google's CDN   Hope you can help me know why using Google's CDN put ads on my website Thanks",True
@exmachina767,2016-07-26T01:02:23Z,0,"A couple of tips for those of you out there dealing with content not refreshing and whatnot: if you've followed this tutorial, maybe the simplest thing is to disable the browser's cache. Just open up the web console in your browser (all browsers have one) and in the ""Network"" tab see if you can find a ""Disable cache"" option or similar. That should help avoid having to restart Apache web server (which is a waste of time in my opinion, however small you may think it is) just to get fresh content.  Another alternative, which I really like, is using what is called a ""live server"", which is a much simpler web server (unlike Apache, which is a full-blown web server designed for production) usually just used during development, but which has the nice feature of being able to automatically detect when you've made changes to your sources and ""automagically"" reloading the web page for you. This makes the development experience very cool, as you get immediate feedback and save a few keystrokes every few seconds or so (it depends a lot on how fast you develop and how often you want to see the results of your changes.) Just Google ""live server"" or ""live reload"" to get more details about this option. By the way, this is an option only if you're developing on your local machine (which I really think you should do), which is not the approach this tutorial has taken.",True

@Colstonewall,2014-09-28T23:10:33Z,1,"Any particular reason you didn't use Flask-Bootstrap? I've seen several people do it this way (your way), although I was never quite sure why they didn't use Flask-Bootstrap.",True
