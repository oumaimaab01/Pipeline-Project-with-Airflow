@MrZKaiser,2017-11-09T22:43:30Z,5,"From FAQ on Go: Why doesn't my multi-goroutine program use multiple CPUs? The number of CPUs available simultaneously to executing goroutines is controlled by the GOMAXPROCS shell environment variable. In earlier releases of Go, the default value was 1, but as of Go 1.5 the default value is the number of cores available. Therefore programs compiled after 1.5 should demonstrate parallel execution of multiple goroutines. To change the behavior, set the environment variable or use the similarly-named function of the runtime package to configure the run-time support to utilize a different number of threads.  Programs that perform parallel computation might benefit from a further increase in GOMAXPROCS. However, be aware that concurrency is not parallelism.",True
