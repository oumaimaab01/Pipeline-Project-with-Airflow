@DLmadison100,2023-07-28T00:40:05Z,0,"I have a question. I currently have GPT4All on my PC. I'm using a simple install package that uses  the CPU and system RAM. My PC is a workstation (custom build) running with an Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 CPU, (14 cores / 28 threads), and 32GB of system RAM. I also have an RTX 2060 graphics card, with 12GB of GDDR5 memory but, that would not seem needed for this framework I have installed. The largest chatbots available are 13B and have a minimum system requirement of 16GB RAM.  I have dedicated 12 threads, which seems to be, functionally, just the same as when I had 8 dedicated to the Chatbot. It typically responds faster than the time it takes me, (usually) to ask it questions but, I notice it hallucinates. My question is, would I be able to run this 40B local LLM (Falcon) with my current system and, if so, where would I download such a Instruct LLM like this; (that would run on my CPU /system RAM)?",True

Inference works well on my RTX 4080 (16GB) GPU too. As soon as I load the model using torch.bfloat16, the transformers library allocated ~14GB of GPU memory, but it works really well!  I'm going to have to replace my LLM app development with this local endpoint to save cost on OpenAI API calls ;) I wonder if that's a thing, a local dev loop pointing at a smaller, locally hosted LLM, and then when pushed to production, a large model or hosted endpoint, a la GPT-4. Depending on how you use the LLM in your application, I can imagine this could possibly lead to a whole new class of heisen-like bugs. Interesting to think about.  Great vid btw.

@WadRex,2023-07-05T22:25:52Z,6,"Amazing vid. One question, tho, is base ChatGPT actually a 175B? Was it confirmed by anyone? I mean, the ""original default"" version probably was somewhere around those amount of params. However, since they introduced the ""turbo"" version, I feel like they just scaled it down. It feels to me that it actually got dumber in some instances, and additionally, how would they actually speed it up if the underlying architecture is still GPT-3.5. I definitely do agree tho that the Falcon 40B and LLaMA-65B ""feel"" more knowledgeable than 3.5 from my experience, with LLaMA slightly outperforming Falcon. This is all subjective ofcourse and it depends on what your use case is. This ties neatly with final observation. The coding part of these models is still FAR from what I could get even with 3.5. This might change, however, if we finetune the base models to act as a sort of agents for specific tasks since the models are ours to modify. I tried playing with LoRA / QLoRA, but I couldn't achieve any good results for some reason (LLaMA models). I tried replicating early Alpaca training, and it all flopped. There are probably some errors in the code I can not seem to recognize...
