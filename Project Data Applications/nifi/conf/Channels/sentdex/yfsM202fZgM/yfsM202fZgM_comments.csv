@dadsquadmusic,2022-08-27T03:09:06Z,0,Could the incorrect small number answers be attributed to rounding errors that accrue when the input is too small?,True
@baljitkaur-jc9bz,2021-01-20T17:22:46Z,0,Can you help me with the architecture of ANN to add digits of a number?,True
@Alex2Buzz,2018-05-23T01:30:41Z,0,"Have you tried the addition one with leading zeroes? It looks like it pays attention to columns, so maybe that would help.",True
@StanleySalvatierra,2018-04-23T05:08:23Z,0,Do your think transfer learning can be used for learn first sum and later subtraction and later on  to more comple x stuffs and make the model learn step by step and  and make his job more easy???,True
@chrilikxeon8259,2018-04-20T01:03:25Z,0,How can i get a free laptop??M from south africa,True
@cavitycat,2018-04-19T20:30:45Z,0,"just saw this article of arxiv (granted it's 3 years old) and thought it was kind of interesting: https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4615 has to do with a similar problem, though I suppose these videos are more about finding ""unconventional"" uses for NNs",True
@tamerius1,2018-04-17T19:37:12Z,0,11:24 use sublime's multi cursoring! select the comma and repeadetly press ctrl+d. Then just hit the right arrow and space once and you're done.,True
@jordandejong2791,2018-04-17T11:38:56Z,0,Love the mug rotation.,True
@10rmp,2018-04-17T05:40:53Z,1,Can you make a video on how to solve algebra word problem using Deep Learning?,True
@adeeb12321,2018-04-17T00:30:41Z,1,"I'm waiting for ""The Matrix"" tutorial <3",True
@AvaroxCrash,2018-04-16T21:14:01Z,0,"You could see if it know the basic rules of arithmetic, like if it has commutativity or stuffs like that",True
@Nickle314,2018-04-16T17:57:22Z,0,"1. Could you start with single digits first - learn those.  2. Then extend the model training it on 2 digits by 1 digit, 1 by 2 etc 3. Then 2 digit x 2 digit.   etc.   Do you need to keep in the simpler examples in the training sets as you progress to harder?   Sort of the way human's learn.",True
@korigarim,2018-04-16T17:44:01Z,1,It would probably have performed better if you entered small digits additions as 000004+000001,True
@davidcristobal7152,2018-04-16T16:35:55Z,0,What kind of model are you using? May be a recurrent network chewing digit after digit could get a better result?,True
@joydeepmukherjee8263,2018-04-16T16:27:08Z,0,"This comment is not related to the video, but I was following your cats vs dogs series. I made a few tweaks & got about 94% accuracy on the validation set. Did I over fit the data? Here is my tensorboard model:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=123DyWlC5JErrpSbDLN1vp_VzUM2dAkr4. Finally I would like to thank you for all these videos.",True
@Arnthorg,2018-04-16T16:19:32Z,1,can deep learning also do music composition?,True
@camdenparsons5114,2018-04-16T16:07:03Z,0,Have you ever attempted to gradually train a network? like start with easy training sets and progressively make them more difficult. I have heard its an effective technique but idk if it would help learn multiple behaviors.,True
@Abdullah-vu4fk,2018-04-16T15:53:33Z,0,"Mr. Kinsley, would you consider making a series of algorithm and data structures videos? Your approach of simplifying every aspect of python language is quite amazing, that's why your take on other CS subjects will be extremely helpful.",True
@celivalg,2018-04-16T15:36:16Z,2,"ho god, if it has any accuracy with encryption, it could get very ugly very fast",True
@JohnDupuyCOMO,2018-04-16T15:09:36Z,0,"A direction that would be interesting: humans are known for thinking in a linear fashion. We are good at estimating addition and multiplication. But we are really bad at ""intuiting"" exponential math. From an economics point of view, it is why we have a hard time grasping the effect of things such as Moore's law. We can do the math, but it doesn't ""feel"" right. So, does deep learning have such a problem? Can it learn simple x^y ?",True
@easyBob100,2018-04-16T14:25:22Z,1,Very cool!  Can't wait to see the results and the encryption creation/breaking!,True
@Burn1nSun,2018-04-16T13:38:05Z,3,New cup!,True
@tissuebox1229,2018-04-16T13:29:49Z,1,"hey sentdex, my guess at to why it gets so many error when you are giving the input is that the random of python made the sample not super random that thats why it got 100% accuracy",True
@tissuebox1229,2018-04-16T13:18:42Z,1,your code is ugly,True
@danweecc,2018-04-16T13:12:28Z,0,"I had felt that you  could have gone with larger than 512 node layers. I'm guessing that each node will end up representing one number and with lesser nodes, it could represent fewer unique numbers as features.",True
