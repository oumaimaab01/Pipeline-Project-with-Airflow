@martinmartin6300,2020-04-04T18:32:56Z,0,"Hey I'm very eager to know whether your inner training loop (""for example in batch"") is actually parallelizrd on your GPU or how to achieve this. Otherwise, you probably waste some resources as your GPU has to hold while you switch in your CPU to the next example in batch as it is done on CPU I suppose? Especially when the GPU has more computing units than are needed for calculation of a layer you could do multiple layers in parallel on GPU which means that you actually need to throw multiple examples of a batch at the same time on your GPU.",True
