@jagadishgospat2548,2021-01-21T21:19:04Z,0,"Hey man, I have a question kinda thing. Well I have this assistant sort of thing which has a password system at first and then if they don't fail it the program continues to ask for input() for the next ifs and elses which is this function that opens apps you used like  "" import os, try: def startfile etc.. etc.. ""   but I don't know how to make it have options, I tried: (if input = ""first"":     try:         def etc""first desired app"")  (elif input = ""second"":     try:       ""second desired App"")  and  (else ""third"": ""*ANOTHER ONE*"")  But as soon as my ifs and elses start right after my first input() cmd just exits but not the default python code runner (I don't know what it's called). If you even get what I'm trying to do and know a solution or if anyone knows a solution just say it or import os  I'm_stupid = false  if      #imstupid     I'm_stupid = True      print(""you are a dumb b*tch"")     exit()  else:    print(""*solution*"") #in replys section",True
