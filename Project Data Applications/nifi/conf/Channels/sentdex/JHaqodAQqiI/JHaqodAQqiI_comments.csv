@mertfromhell,2023-10-18T18:05:26Z,0,nice tutorial man as a beginner to ml this explanations much better then reading books,True
@jairajsahgal5062,2021-09-21T18:13:00Z,0,Did you calculate minimum by integration?,True
@jairajsahgal5062,2021-09-21T18:05:05Z,0,Thank you,True
@anshulmehta3351,2020-05-14T05:37:06Z,0,watch from 3:24 in 2x speed lolll,True
@samtux762,2020-04-02T14:14:03Z,0,"Great tutorials so far! Basic SVM was somewhat hard to grasp, this tutorial is so obvious.",True
@krystaljinluma,2019-11-13T03:15:10Z,1,"Still don't understand why the slack variable is ""slack"" variable. Would be helpful if you explain intuitively why that variable is a ""slack"" variable...",True
@pred9990,2019-11-04T20:31:41Z,0,finally I found out what is C),True
@huseyincansimsek9675,2019-08-29T15:54:19Z,0,Summarize your tutorials.And Have you any documents related tutorials?,True
@sandeephooda9253,2019-01-17T02:56:27Z,1,5 Starts,True
@RedShipsofSpainAgain,2018-07-06T02:06:42Z,2,15:30 so the value of c is kinda like the value of lambda in a L1 or L2 regularization term?,True
@jrM5492,2018-05-21T03:23:34Z,7,"instead of spending all this time explaining the pupil stuff with incredibly slow speed, you can actually spend the time wisely getting accurate equations with better notations and illustrations.",True
@MrXterminate,2018-01-06T17:39:07Z,0,A very nice explantion on overfitting: https://elitedatascience.com/overfitting-in-machine-learning,True
@weikailu9423,2017-12-26T20:03:02Z,0,"Hey great video! But I am just wondering that since c is a just a coefficient deciding the magnitude of slack, does it change where the global minimum would locate?",True
@abhaydandekar,2017-11-09T05:27:53Z,0,Can C be less than 1?,True
@JacobSmithodc,2017-06-29T01:39:32Z,18,"""Overfitment"" -- When you spend too much time at the gym.",True
@clickaws2654,2017-06-11T07:12:35Z,4,"your video of ML is suggest by Big Bro and i watched your video and i am beginner to learn ML , it is quite difficult but i practiced and  it may become easier ,thanks for your videos......Thank you so Much",True
@cyl5207,2017-02-21T17:44:55Z,0,thank you!,True
@rohitgaikwad4246,2016-10-25T18:42:13Z,23,"You really make learning fun. I was buried in textbooks for days, figuring out SVM concepts and your videos cleared them all within a couple hours. Thank you so much!",True
@kennethnielsen3453,2016-10-03T05:52:52Z,0,Wouldn't it be possible to introduce the Akaike (or other) information criteria here to decide if you are over fitting? Or at the least it might let you choose between different seperating hyperplanes. I am thinking something along the lines of the letting the number of support vectors play the part of parameters.,True
@RealMcDudu,2016-06-17T13:23:43Z,0,A wild guess - *C* stands for  *Cost Function*,True
@sivaramakrishnanvaidyanath9374,2016-06-02T22:16:16Z,7,Thanks for your brilliant videos. I suppose you have not already uploaded your tutorial on Deep Learning. Eagerly looking forward to it.,True
@vivasjimmy,2016-05-31T15:20:15Z,1,thanks for sharing your knowledge,True
