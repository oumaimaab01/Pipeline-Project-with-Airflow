@DarkRedman31,2018-10-17T23:36:17Z,0,"11:18 wait a second, so if two planets belong to the same category (empty or yours or theirs) with same radius, only one is taken in account, seems to be a logic error in my opinion.",True

@ProjectSuperSport,2018-01-11T18:27:09Z,0,"Hey sentdex, great video as always :) . I was wondering, have you ever went through a course covering deep learning / neural nets? or is it all just trial and error, libraries docs etc? I can recall that in your ""digits images classifier"" video you went down to stripping a 20*20 pic to a 400 long array - which of course isn't the most encouraging thing you can do to help your algorithm work. I wonder if somthing is wrong about the approach here in a similar way...",True
@arkoraa,2018-01-10T19:41:18Z,0,"this is amazing. I knew this was a possible approach for this game, but had no idea about its implementation...",True
@fisouz,2018-01-10T18:09:57Z,4,"Planet size itself is not relevant as the only difference comes down to: Planet.num_docking_spots: The max number of ships that can be docked. As a bigger planet with 5 spots is no better than a slightly smaller planet with 5 spots.  Also, on my code I used a list to control distances and entities associated to each ship: ships_by_distance[0] = distance, ships_by_distance[1] = ship.id, any reason this is a bad choice?  Great vid, btw. I wish I could just sit with you and discuss my halite 2 code :D",True

@kidix7,2018-01-09T23:10:13Z,0,"Hi sentdex! The size matters for how many docking spots you have, keep that in mind. 30% Chance I think it's a lot, but we'll see how it ends up, every 3/4 rounds changing your mind will end up not doing a thing. I think your code can be optimizer a bit so I'll might have a look so you can control more ships 20 seems like a low number to me. Lastly, thannk you so much <3 love it. Keep up the good work",True
@pluto8404,2018-01-09T23:09:03Z,4,9 planets. Just to be clear.,True

@richardkirk3496,2018-01-09T23:03:05Z,27,Sentdex is always trending on my list,True
@kun312008,2018-01-09T20:41:00Z,9,Larger planets do have more docking spots. Docking spots range anywhere from 2 to 6 depending on the size.,True

@easyBob100,2018-01-09T19:52:49Z,0,"Just a note to anyone who's doing this:  In the javascript version, the default ship 'navigation' code has a nasty bug, you'll fly into planets if the ship id is the same as a planet's id if it's in your path. :)",True
@cool_frans,2018-01-09T19:43:48Z,0,Hi sentdex. Just wanted to know a few headers of what to learn to go in almost any imported file like for example the hlt folder for halite and completely understand the scripts. I am 16 and have gone through all your basic videos and most of your intermediate videos. So i basically just want to know what i have to learn more or if it is just taking your time and going through the scripts to understand them,True
@tatufmetuf,2018-01-09T19:26:31Z,0,Did someone managed to run the ML starter bot on windows ? I'm stuck at the last part of the installation : Go to to the root folder of the bot and run make.,True
@Meskalin_,2018-01-09T19:14:33Z,10,Really enjoyed this video! I like that you use snippets instead of coding it all on screen a lot,True
