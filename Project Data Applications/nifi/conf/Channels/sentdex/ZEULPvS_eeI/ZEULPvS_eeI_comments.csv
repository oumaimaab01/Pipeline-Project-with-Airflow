One question, when I tried to indicate the `start` end `end` date in the zipline.run_algorithm() function with hour specification it doesn't read it properly. For instance, if I indicate the `start` as datetime(2018, 1, 2, 9, 33, 0, 0, pytz.utc) it trows me the error Equity(0 [SPY]) does not exist on 2018-01-02 00:00:00+00:00.

@Factorpad,2018-05-12T15:05:03Z,1,"Nice video Harrison. For your subscribers who want a background on portfolio optimization and constraints it may be worth looking at white papers provided by risk model providers that work with huge ($1B+) quant funds. Whether it be a fundamental-factor or economic macro factor APT model, firms like Barra, Northfield, Axioma, Wilshire have been integrating optimization with risk models for decades. They're expensive, but you may be able to improve your performance by incorporating nuances of optimization with constraints in Python. -Paul",True
