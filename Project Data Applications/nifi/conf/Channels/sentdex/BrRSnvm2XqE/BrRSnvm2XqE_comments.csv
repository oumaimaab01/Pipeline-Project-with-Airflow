@robinabhatia2944,2020-05-02T04:56:35Z,3,"@sentdex, instead of putting pygame.time.wait(10), at the top after importing the libraries, you should put clock=pygame.time.Clock(), and in the place of pygame.time.wait(10) you should put clock.tick(frame rate) and in the place of frame rate, you should put the number of fps you want. pygame.time.wait(10) will slow down the script and i know that that's what you want but the remaining will be executed as per the processor speed and that means that the game will run at different speeds at different computers and that's what happeded to my game when i shared it. My friends pc was ""awesome"" so the processor was faster and the bullets were also approaching faster in my game. when i put clock..... then it was running at the same speed at both the pc's even though the processor speed was not same ! Thanks for reading this !",True
@robinabhatia2944,2020-05-02T04:45:17Z,1,"After making all these videos, did you ever make a single game of your own, because i know it would be  nice and in the next video, can you possibly show the gameplay ?",True
@_Caose,2020-03-30T22:28:12Z,0,"How games handle incredible amounts of data such as thousands of objects on 1920x1080 Fulscreen with complete UHD renderings, shaders and individual logic at high fps if even this basic program,  just 75 basic moving cubes on a small window, cant run without lag? 75 is supposed to be nothing for this kind of a program. I run the sample code in the description, I have i7-9750H and 1660ti, that 1 rotating wire cube uses 6-7% CPU and 11-12% GPU already. For example, even in pure pygame, it can handle +3000 objects with individual logic and 47kb sprites each at 80-90 fps.  I really dont get why 75 cubes cause a lag. Is that because using Python?",True
@jonathancunnane1200,2019-09-29T06:44:46Z,0,Is there an alternative to having to draw all the cubes every second. For example if you wanted to make a large map for a game,True

@lonelyapples5744,2019-07-04T05:58:03Z,0,I lost you this episode and gave up,True
@lonelyapples5744,2019-07-04T05:56:17Z,0,Way too fast and hard to understand in this episode,True
@NikkiMcMistie,2019-05-18T14:44:37Z,0,"I'm curious, where do you think, would be the best place to find out how to make a .obj importer?",True
@guyy4792,2017-12-19T15:48:50Z,0,"Sentdex, could u possibly make a 3D environment game like Minecraft using openGL? Just asking!",True
@MasthaX,2017-11-13T00:07:02Z,1,"Hey Sentdex, I've been following allot of your different tutorials (this, tensorflow and some others) and I really like the explanation and example code. 20 minutes ago I didn't know anything of OpenGL programming, but now I can already write some basic game logic (and I'm working on it!) very easily. Great job!",True
@Narutofan262678,2017-07-07T14:54:07Z,0,"I keep getting this error. I tried seeing if ""for x in range(max_distance):"" would fix it, but I keep getting it. I have my max_distance set to 300 like in the video and every other bit of the coding is the same, but it doesn't work. Perhaps it's because I'm on Python 3.2?

@slap_my_hand,2016-06-04T21:03:08Z,1,why didn't you make a cube object?,True
@ihsancemilcicek2785,2016-05-29T07:02:44Z,3,Why don't you use Classes ? I think creating object randomly could be much more cleaner,True
