@soyanchd5439,2019-06-03T06:42:45Z,11,"IMPORTANT: this DOES NOT if you want to sort by numerical values. It only appears to work here since alphabetical sorting of digits is the same as the numerical. The default behavior  will treat the number as a string. A solution provided by stack overflow is this:        sort = sorted(reader, key=lambda row: int(row[index]), reverse=True)  Will give a descending numerical sort.",True

@ipadguy1974,2017-06-09T21:46:05Z,1,"Great tutorial!  I decided to take the plunge and learn PyQt and explore Python's blockchain offerings.  I've got a list of Bitcoin prices with timestamps, and wanted to see how to sort them in reverse chronological order.  This was a BIG help.  I spent the early part of my career using proprietary development tools, like SQL Server, SASS, SRSS, Visual Studio, J.D. Edwards, and decided to make the shift to open sourcce tools.  I have programmed in a range of languages, including COBOL, BASIC, LOGO, C/C++, etc, and I am impressed with how easy Python really is.  I also concur--Python 3 support and adoption leaves something to be desired.  For me, the recent advances in Qt (ie. PyQt5) are fueling my interest in Python 3.",True
