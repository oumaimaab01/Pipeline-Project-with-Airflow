@koog1000,2019-12-12T03:29:37Z,1,"Ha! I almost mentioned Nyquist theorem in my last video when you were talking about the sample rate you need. In general, you actually want to sample much faster than the Nyquist rate to have a good representation of your signal. There is actually another equation that describes your measurement error based on your oversampling rate (I forget what that equation is called right now). The general rule of thumb we use in our industry is 10X oversampling rate, and anything less than 5X oversampling is regarded as too inaccurate for measurement purposes. If you look at the jupyter notebook code that you showed in the video, they are also only using data up to ~fs/6, or 6X oversampling ratio.You can see this in the frequency band limit they defined for gamma waves.    Long story short, your system with 16 channels at 125Hz is really only good up to frequencies of ~25Hz. I think that in order to train your neural network to understand motor skill movements then you need a higher sample rate. You also should not be using fft data above fs/5.",True

@333jordyg,2019-11-11T06:11:51Z,2,"Awesome stuff man! I really love your enthusiasm, thanks for making this series.   I really want to point you to an issue you seem to not be addressing: What mental function is caused by (or causes) what brain activity? And crucially for an EEG BCI, can that particular mental-function-brain-activity pairing be classified?   Thinking the word ""left"" or ""right"" is not necessarily caused by (or causes) brain activity that is distinguishable by man or machine learning algorithm SPECIFICALLY using EEG. In the case of imagined speech or inner speech, the brain activity that matters is, perhaps, beyond your reach. By all means, continue trying  - if you find a way to make it work, the world would love to know!   However, you should be aware that researchers have identified a few certain mental-function-brain-activity pairings that do work well for EEG BCIs. Please look into ""motor imagery BCIs."" When you imagine a certain body part to be moved, a certain spot on your motor cortex engages a specific brain activity pattern (called Event-Related Desychonization [ERD], in mu and beta bands). Amazingly, a different imagined body part movement will cause the same type of brain activity, but in a different location of the motor cortex. Therefore, imagining right-hand motor imagery will cause a very DISTINGUISHABLE signal from left-hand motor imagery - different electrode channels showing different amounts of ERD you will find in the FFT of the data. Here's a literature review on this topic, I could send more papers if you want: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232268/   Best of luck! I'll be following this!",True

@beyhan9191,2019-11-09T18:17:15Z,6,I’m thinking about your training data is not correct.

There’s digits ‘7’ but this handwritten ‘7’ is not 100% ‘7’ It’s also looks like ‘1’ maybe 2% so my idea is maybe you can look at left and right data correlations based on channels and you can only consider about negative correlation channels. Because right and left are opposite so this informations must be hidden between channels. It seems you have lots of way to go and needs more preprocessing and data cleaning.

@N77b44,2019-11-09T17:19:09Z,13,"EEG signals don't tend to do a great job at picking up specific thought contents like left vs right. You might have more success if you focus on modelling a difference between brain patterns in moving two different muscles (e.g. left vs right foot) or in some more global thought difference like hyper focus vs induced boredom.   EEG sums over the electrical potentials of neurons across the whole brain so I'd expect the hyper-specific differences in content like ""think left"" vs ""think right"" to largely average out considering that those get processed in relatively similar areas for a signal this spatially course. Thinking about or actually moving body areas on the Left vs the Right is ""lateralized"" in the brain in that the left hemisphere controls the right side and the right hemisphere controls the left side. That's extremely spatially separated so you probably wouldn't get too much signal aggregation and have easily separable conditions.",True
