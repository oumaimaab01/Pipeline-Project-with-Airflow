@RealMcDudu,2016-06-29T16:31:53Z,0,"FYI - you don't always have to ask to ""read"" the file you opened. It's actually faster to iterate over a file object that is not ""read"".   l = open('file','r') for line in l:     pass (or code)  is much faster than   l = open('file','r') for line in l.read() / l.readlines()    pass (or code)  the 2nd one will be 1.5x more expansive time-wise.",True
