So you might do SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE LOWER(KEYWORD) = 'python'  ...or   SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE UPPER(KEYWORD) = 'PYTHON'  ... or  SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE KEYWORD = 'python' COLLATE NOCASE   I would use COLLATE NOCASE in preference to UPPER() or LOWER() as they probably have a slight conversion overhead -- as _any_ string conversion function does -- whereas COLLATE NOCASE is perhaps more efficient.",True
