@step7steveX,2019-01-19T10:52:19Z,0,Nice Firenze background Sendex. Let me know if you go there and we shall meet for an espresso coffee,True

@jcf3300,2017-07-25T03:42:25Z,3,"@sentdex @HarrisonK -- I think what I like the most about you via your channel & site is your genuine approach. The fact that you publish your material in its raw form is SOOO useful to those starting out and/or needing inspiration. Your coding sessions, like this one in particular, remind me a lot of my own, which makes watching these videos all he more helpful. And while you might catch heat for ""lack of elegance"" or ""try/except logic approach"" etc., you get the job done, which some people that dog you might forget in their own coding lives. Namely, solving a computational problem is what programming is FOR (at least from an engineering standpoint). That is, tackle the problem first even if ad-hoc, THEN refactor and make readable; don't mistake the forest from the trees. Anyway, here's a shotout to your presentation style and your ability to get things done. Please, keep it up.",True
@ryanshrott9622,2016-12-12T18:17:32Z,2,"@sentdex - I am getting many errors. Would it be possible for you to post the .csv file for ""key_stats_acc_perf_NO_NA.csv"" and ""key_stats_acc_perf_WITH_NA.csv"" so that I could follow along with the rest of the series. Thanks:)",True
@eyaldar,2016-10-02T08:40:11Z,0,"It would seem that the way to get a bunch of tickers all at the same time doesn't work very well when the batches are too big, not sure why though... Anyway to anyone who wants to know, you would right it pretty much the same: quandl.get([""WIKI/A"", ""WIKI/AA"",...], start_date=""2000-12-12"", end_date=""2014-12-30"", authtoken=auth_tok) and then you would get one gaint data frame where each stock columns are written like this, for example AAPL would be: ""AAPL - Adj. Close"".  I guess there is also the ""get_table"" option but I didn't want to use it...",True
@RafalMankaPL,2016-06-17T12:28:22Z,0,"when using python threading, requesting quandl for putting the csv file together takes around 5 minutes. Agree, the code is messy, but if you would put up a class together, that will introduce next layer of complexity to the problem which is not the subject of this course. Great stuff!",True

@AmolAgrawal1992,2016-05-14T17:58:34Z,0,"+sentdex I'm receiving the following warning consistently when I'm trying to predict the values.

@alchemication,2015-10-25T15:08:35Z,2,"This stuff is amazing man! The only thing is (as a web/app developer) - it is causing your head to explode as it's totally messy, lots of code duplication and one massive function used to do so much.  Once again, thanks a lot for all awesome content, only that one thing, which has been in my head all the time (""He will regret all this mess one day"") :)  Peace!",True
@bruete6,2015-10-01T05:43:37Z,0,"It is a really nice video, and I like it so much!  BTW, personally, I would like to suggest that for the ""ticker"" it is better to get the information from some online CSV file. If I did not watch the previous video, the method to get ""ticker"" is kind of weird.   Please keep updating~",True
@mjoass,2015-04-26T05:49:32Z,3,The problem found around the 20 minute mark was that we had changed row = sp500_df[(sp500_df.index to be row = sp500_1y[(sp500_1y.index   When you copy paste the code at the 22 minute mark this is fixed :),True
