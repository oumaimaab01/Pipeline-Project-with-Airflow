@syeda1551,2019-02-17T18:06:19Z,0,Hi .your tutorials are amazing.. just like iPhone does that after detecting different faces in a picture or gallery  it makes different folders of each detected  face ? Can I do that in open CV ?,True
@roachsinai6716,2018-11-09T11:28:08Z,0,"Thanks for this great series! And anyone download the `bg.txt` from the web link provided by @sentdex, and using Linux, maybe should check the file by `vi` not `vim` to see is there a `^M` at the end of each line, and remove it to avoid the ERROR: invalid fastbin entry (free) [1]    29831 abort (core dumped)  opencv_createsamples.",True

@BigRedVan,2018-08-02T18:09:06Z,5,Could you explain how you copy them to the server? Everything made sense except how to do that.,True
@Casowsky,2018-06-04T19:15:07Z,0,"Just a question, in the part where we remove the 'uglies', why not use a np.bitwise_and(x,y).all() operation as opposed to the np.bitwise_xor(x,y).any()?  Both seem to produce the same result (as far as I've tested with a folder of images and the Flickr 'file not found' image), and to me it seems to make a bit more sense logically. You're testing to see whether or not all the pixels in image A are the same as pixels in image B (because you want to remove those) and you can do that by 'anding' them with each other.  Just wondering if there's something I'm missing or if there are certain situations where that breaks or produces incorrect results. Loving the series by the way - you have an awesome 'line by line' teaching style and great production on all your videos!",True
@jrM5492,2018-06-02T00:17:09Z,0,"1. how do you know the positive images contain the object you want to find, and negative images don't contain? 2. how to access the root/opencv_workspace from pc? I'm not seeing anything here.",True

@shenqiangshou,2018-01-01T07:17:19Z,0,"If you only have access to a shell and don't want to bother viewing the pre-de'uglied' file list to find a 'ugly', you can always do a ls -lS|tail, basically sort by size ascending and show last 10.  Any actual image will be fairly large, but most of the 'uglies' will be the exactly the same, and tiny, size. Like 973 bytes or something.",True
@geraldsy,2017-11-08T03:42:39Z,1,Hi why do we need to add another for loop (for file_type in ['neg']:) instead of going straight with for img in os.listdir('neg'): can someone enlighten me?  THANKS!,True
@furkancetin3195,2017-10-19T18:21:50Z,0,hey harrison I run this code and there is a problem in the neg folder I have 779 images for the first download link but in the bg.txt there is 432 lines. Do not they have to be the same?,True

@TurkishLoserInc,2016-11-11T06:05:01Z,0,"OK, so for python 2.7 and opencv 3.1 ( the tutorial to download on ubuntu 16.04 is here: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/ You might need a fix when opencv doesn't compile: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6016  After following those steps, we fall at these tutorials. As we are on python 2.7, both the previous version and this file have some small changes that need to be made, which can be found here: https://github.com/UltharPeliki7/oduasv2017/blob/master/haarurl.py If you have any questions, I welcome them below.",True
