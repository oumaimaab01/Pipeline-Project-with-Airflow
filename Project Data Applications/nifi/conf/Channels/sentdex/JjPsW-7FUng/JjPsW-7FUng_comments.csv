@sobinsunny3974,2018-10-18T15:39:07Z,4,"Successful and thanks a lot. I had a lot of issues in live streaming with my pi. Firstly, VLC was not getting installed in my pi. I browsed over different forums and watched lot of videos but problem did not resolve. I tried with one of my other rpi and vlc got installed easily with these: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install vlc  So, if you face the same problem, just remove your SD card and format it using any SD card formatter software. Then copy and paste extracted NOOBS file into the SD card. Now, insert the SD card into the rpi and install rasbian OS all new. This might resolve all the problems with VLC or any other package installation.  Secondly, live streaming to another device was unable. I downloaded VLC in my android smartphone. Open VLC and in Open MRL option type http://yourIPaddress:8160. Also, Open VLC media player in windows laptop or desktop and click File - Network stream - HTTP - http://yourIPaddress:8160 and click OK.  This will give your live streaming to that device very sooner if your internet is good enough.  IMPORTANT: Your RPi, Smartphone as well as Windows must be connected to same IP ie.,WiFi or wlan  NB: If you don't know your IP address, open terminal in RPi and type ifconfig. You will see your IP address in inet.",True

@mattrupert,2015-07-17T17:07:53Z,0,"Hi Harrison, In your video here on getting the Pi camera to stream you have the long command line ""raspivid -o - -t 0 -hf -w 800 -h 400 -fps 24 |cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ts,dst=:8­160}' :demux=h264""  I did this and got it to work for the most part.  Im seeing all kind of warnings and buffering going on from the text window output.  Im wondering if the Pi2b that I have is not able to keep up computationally with the requirements to convert the video into a h264 stream.  I think I knocked the resolution down to 320x200.  Does the command line you have there take advantage and use the hardware h264 encoder that is onboard the pi2?  At least from what I have read in the specs there is a hardware encoder.  Thanks for your video!!

@dennoh01,2015-02-15T23:36:14Z,0,"ok, I'm late on this one ... just about 8 mths!! I've rigged up a pi to a servo which allows me to pan the camera  (all Python using the Dagu python coding) ... however, I am not streaming video at this point, just moving the servo. I can stream video using VLC or the excellent php module described in your newer Youtube tutorial. What i need is the basics of incorporating php and python to allow a simple stream with just two screen 'buttons' to pan my camera left and right whilst streaming the video. I have no ambition to 'save' anything, 'adjust' anything ... just to stream video and pan left or right. Is there 'core' php code to stream the video which allows me to  include two simple buttons (pan left/pan right) that drive python client code that pans the camera module using appropriate PWM python GPIO code . This is difficult to explain, but I hope you understand my requirements :-)",True
