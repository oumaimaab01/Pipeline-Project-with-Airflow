Both cameras will display video fine.",True

@mmuuuuhh,2016-02-16T09:34:34Z,0,"Just for curiosity, does anyone know why they make the syntax not consistent with the C++ version of OpenCV?  For example the api specifies the cvtColor() as:  C++: void cvtColor(InputArray src, OutputArry dst, int code, int dstCn = 0) Python: cv2.cvtColor(src, code[, dst[, dstCn]]) -> dst  What wonders me most, is that in C++ you have to give the return array as parameter, in Python you get it returned.",True
