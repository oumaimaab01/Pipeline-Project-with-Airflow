@Veri7a,2015-12-15T05:47:03Z,0,I am guessing the reason you would have problems consistently getting your 500.html is because 500 is a Server error as opposed to a page error with a 404. If the server is having problems accessing your templates location i doubt it would be able to render the 500.html. My idea anyway.,True
@jd5787,2015-08-23T10:49:32Z,0,"Just wondering: is it possible (and advisable) to have a single html page dealing with all types of html/server errors? (in which case, a function in the __init__ file would have a few if statements to classify the error and the error message would have to be passed to the HTML to Jinja via a variable. what do you think?",True

@GeneAiello,2015-04-09T19:11:40Z,0,"Harrison, Again great tutorial. You should look into the Flask Debug flag/option, for your development environment. I believe this is why you could never get back helpful errors. eg.  app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", debug=True)  Also, If you enable debug the server will reload itself on code changes automatically!",True
