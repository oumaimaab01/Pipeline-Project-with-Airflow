@tedanthonytarona8355,2023-10-16T01:31:35Z,0,HELLO SIR. CAN YOU MAKE AN UPDATED VIDEO FOR 2023?,True

@ericlougheed9440,2020-03-20T21:43:04Z,0,"Help I get this code at the bottom. the code is below: AttributeError: 'Positions' object has no attribute 'itervalues'         def my_record_vars(context, data): long_count=0 short_count=0  for position in context.portfolio.positions.itervalues(): if position.amount > 0: long_count += 1 elif position.amount < 0: short_count += 1",True
@tonihuhtiniemi1222,2020-01-09T10:19:17Z,29,"If you have ""AttributeError: 'Positions' object has no attribute 'itervalues'""   Change itervalues() -> values()   Then it should work.",True
@RukDaWho,2019-12-26T20:40:59Z,0,It seems Quantopian algorithms now defaults to python 3?  'itervalues()' method no longer works and generates python error.  New dict method that correlates to itervalues() is values().,True
@luiscunha844,2019-09-11T22:24:24Z,1,"hey, when I build the algo https://pyfiddle.io/fiddle/ce60002d-561a-46da-9462-be00e99ec006/?i=true, I get the following  error : KeyError: 'longs' There was a runtime error on line 94.   can you help me mr.sentdex?",True
@oliviachen7719,2019-08-21T05:58:09Z,1,"Hi Sentdex, thanks for your work! I'm using this series to both dip my toes into Python and to learn about trading with alphas. Don't know much about both but you're doing a phenomenal job teaching!",True
@andreamassacci7942,2019-04-14T17:57:27Z,0,Really nice video. As usal.,True
@mcvcooper3933,2019-02-04T04:25:52Z,0,"Let's be honest, besides the fun learning part. Can we make money with this ?",True
@christopherkunde,2018-09-13T23:52:42Z,9,"9:51    ""Long secs....security....""",True
@arjunkakkar2535,2018-03-19T15:08:18Z,0,what to do about this error:         SyntaxError: pass the non-keyword argument before the keyword argument.,True
@zer0grav1ta5,2018-02-02T01:59:13Z,0,"Hmmm, it appears that you don't set the short_weight to a negative value - or at least I wound finding that problem in my code whilst trying to follow along.  Still very good content tho.",True
@joshuablew2985,2017-09-07T01:50:56Z,0,How would you go about using Quantopian if you supply the stocks to trade each day? Instead of having it query for stocks you provide the ones you want instead.,True
@carstars,2017-08-12T21:01:14Z,3,"Love the series.  Helps understand why with thousands of Algorithms running the market all Alpha will be gone, markets are diving to low volatility with wonderful liquidity for us long term re-balance one a year crowd get to do so well dumping risk onto the trading community and active managers.   Bravo team!",True
@simonchan2394,2017-08-01T08:12:02Z,1,"Also,  you are just passing a dictionary of columns into the Pipeline for 'sentiment', 'longs', and 'shorts'. In the my_rebalance portion of the code, you are only pulling the 'longs' and 'shorts' out of the context for your calculations but we do not pull out the 'sentiment' to use for anything at all so my question is why pass the 'sentiment' as a column into your pipeline in the first place if we do not use it?",True
@simonchan2394,2017-08-01T08:04:47Z,1,"Hi Harrison, in your backtest2, you have created 3 columns in your pipeline. One is sentiment_quantiles and the other two are sentiment_factors >=4 and sentiment_factors <=2 to get your ""improved"" results. I thought we would have to pass consistent variables to the pipeline, therefore, I would have passed sentiment_factors >=4, sentiment_factors <= 2, sentiment_factors, instead of sentiment_quantiles.",True
@mocyyang,2017-07-15T22:30:01Z,0,Really love the content!  One question: is the sentiment_quantiles used anywhere at all? What difference does it make here (vs. not defining it)?,True
@reganarntz-gray9495,2017-05-31T18:41:58Z,1,"Hi - great videos! However, I am getting slightly  different errors and results - would you mind posting the code for the algorithm so that I can compare and find typos?",True
@DaiCathy,2017-04-02T10:09:06Z,4,"hi , is it possible to work on the stocks outside US?",True
@ryanrodriguez3714,2017-03-24T16:02:54Z,0,When I try to compile it on line 46 it says 'output' what should I do?,True
@rshrott,2017-02-05T21:04:35Z,0,"Hi Harrison, I'm feeling slightly lost with all the new terms, packages, etc. Would you suggest I watch the Quantopian videos in addition to yours?",True
