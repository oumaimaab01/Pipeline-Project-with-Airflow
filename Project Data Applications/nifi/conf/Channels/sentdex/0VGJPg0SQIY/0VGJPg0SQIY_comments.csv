@tbjasun,2019-05-23T13:08:25Z,0,"Hey sentdex I just want to say I love your tutorials and I'm picking this up at a killer pace, however when on this step for django I'm hitting some errors with the messages.  For example, I'm using the lines for messages.success(request, f""New Account: {username}"") gives an error because of the preceeding f before the message, and if I omit the f the message works but doesn't display the name. The message shows but it reads New Account: {username}. Same with the error area, it is only displaying the full text {msg} : {form.error_messages[msg]} rather than any actual message. I'm using python 3.5.3, and installed django version just recently 2.2.1. Could there be an issue because of this?  Thanks in advance!",True

@Hassole,2019-04-03T11:17:47Z,36,"I just wanted to say that I really like that sometimes your code doesn't work and we can witness your process as you debug. Some people would just cut the video and patch in a recording without the debug problems. I really appreciate the way you do it and don't see your live debugging as a negative at all! I also like that you look up documentation live and voice your thoughts about whether certain things will work or not. Anytime you can expand on why you are writing the code you are, its like getting into the mind of an experienced dev and helps me learn how to think.    Keep doing what you're doing!",True

I have 2 questions: 1)how does the template header.html ""knows"" the   {{message}} variable?From views when we render the template we also pass context and this is the way template has access to the variable passed in context, but we did not pass variable  messages. 2)When I register user and give password similar to username it does not let me register it. It says password fields don't match but I'm pretty sure they match,(have tried multiple times). For example: username: gamer  , password: gamer123  gives me an error.  thanks",True
