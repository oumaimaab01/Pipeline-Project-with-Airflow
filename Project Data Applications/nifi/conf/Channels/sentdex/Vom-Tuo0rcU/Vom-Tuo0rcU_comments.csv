Very helpful for my game !!!  I'm trying to create a simple game : a character can move right/left and jump with space barre and he has to jump over obstacles on a scrolling background   I'm trying to use your crashing code to make my character ""crash"" into my obstacles but I've got a scrolling background on my game and it just says ""you crashed"" every time I get to the obstacle's coordinates but as it's a scrolling background they is no obstacle any more...   Have you got any tips for doing the same thing as you but with a scrolling background from right to left and static obstacles ? :)",True

@violetbrina,2014-12-02T06:54:50Z,0,"Hey there! I tried a different way of considering collisions that works quite well. I create ranges for the x and y positions of the car and block and check to see if both the x and y overlap (I used 'block' instead of thing and _x instead of _startx). More lines of code, but you don't have to wrap your mind around cases!  #if the block and car collide they crash 		carXs = range( int(x), int(x + car_width) ) 		carYs = range( int(y), int(y + car_height) )  		blockXs = range( int(block_x), int(block_x + block_width) ) 		blockYs = range( int(block_y), int(block_y + block_height) )  		Xcollide = False 		Ycollide = False  		for carX in carXs:     for blockX in blockXs:         if carX == blockX:             Xcollide = True 		 		for carY in carYs:     for blockY in blockYs:         if carY == blockY:             Ycollide = True 		 		if Xcollide and Ycollide:     crash()",True

The music has been part of my life ever since though I never had the chance to learn a thing about game developing . . . until now :) So thanks! I owe you a lot!
