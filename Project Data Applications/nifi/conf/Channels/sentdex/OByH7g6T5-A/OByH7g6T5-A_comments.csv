@nigmaxus,2018-01-10T16:03:28Z,0,"I believe in giving back what I have learned.  Soo here are some minor changes I did to manage the scripts.   I created a logs directory ""logs"" from the halite2 working directory.  ""See below for full path"" I changed your data-creator.py file os.system('..\halite.exe -d ""360 240"" ""python ..\MyBot-1.py"" ""python ..\MyBot-2.py"" >> data.gameout') with open(""..\\train.in"",""a"") as f: with open(""..\\train.in"",""a"") as f:  By adding ..\ and ..\\ changes mean to read from the parent directory.  My new path to run the script will be. D:\1_SRC\Python\halite2\Halite2_Python3_Windows\logs  To start the script I run ""python ..\data-creator.py"" from the logs directory with the ..\  Now all the logging data stays in the logs folder and only the train.in and train.out are saved in the parent folder.   This could be changed to further manage by placing the train data in its own training folder but just having a log folder helps quite a bit.  Nice work on the tutorials, thank you!!!!
