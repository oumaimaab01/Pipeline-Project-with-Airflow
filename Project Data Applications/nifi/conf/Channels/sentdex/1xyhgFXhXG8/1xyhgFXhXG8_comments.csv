@mattimhiyasmith,2018-04-10T22:41:29Z,0,You could make it so you can give a text face and have it draw the expression.. so :) would draw a smiley face? or would this take too long to make some training data? also btw what would happen if you provided multiple numbers and let it draw them?,True
@ChesterZoda,2018-04-10T13:37:11Z,1,Sentdex!  I'm just getting started with Python and looking for some good PRACTICE EXERCISES (with SOLUTIONS) to practice the fundamentals: beginner to intermediate.  Any suggestions? I learn best through trial-and-error with solutions.,True

@hanswoast7,2018-04-09T17:45:25Z,1,"Thank you for all your content. It is amazing! <3  I had some ideas what you could look into, if you like: - Build a fake handwriting generator - Or in reverse, you could develop a basic OCR program - Draw basic facial expressions from smileys / compressed images - Create abstract images from actual art - Maybe a grammatically sound bullshit generator - Maybe a code generator with a very simple goal like ""print whatever the user entered"" or ""add all numbers entered"" to see if it can find the code itself",True
