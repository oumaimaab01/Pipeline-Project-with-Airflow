@flowersgrowinginantarctica,2020-02-24T02:17:26Z,1,"I've noticed that I've also been getting some really high results 80-90%.  Does pickling the data run into issues because we are randomizing the document each time but the pickled data remains the same, so on future runs it has some of the training data in the test data - so those are basically ""knowns"" or is there something else going on?",True
@sarvagyaiitmadras8727,2019-10-29T10:42:21Z,0,"I think U pickled the data after traing and testing both,  that's why,  when I was Calculating Accuracy again it was coming above 90%",True

@KuldeepSingh-cm3oe,2018-12-24T13:27:53Z,0,"I have a question that it's ok that we have used pickle to save our classifier. But, when we are using pickle again to open the ""naivebayes.pickle"" in read mode we are not telling python that which thing we are loading. Then, how come python is knowing that from loading we mean to load the same classifier which we intend to load?",True

@nixonyh06,2018-04-06T22:30:40Z,0,"Hi, I've a question. Do you recommend training with the bayes algorithm to identify positif feedback or just compare it to 'yes' and 'no' and get their percentage. And by the way can I compare phrases to a word like 'of course' to 'yes'. Anyway, thx for the video! It helped me a lot in my projects!!!",True
@XiaodanZhang2,2018-03-08T16:35:41Z,0,"The accuracy inconsistent is not from naive bayesian, but from all_words.keys() is random since the keys in a python dictionary is not sorted;  the better way to extract features is to calculate tfidf scores, have them sorted, and then do the training. the result will be consisent",True
@pradiplamsal1403,2018-01-05T23:40:40Z,1,"""lot more useful than it is..."" hahah.. like your endearing quirks..   very informative",True
@yorickbolster782,2017-12-01T21:49:05Z,0,"Really appreciate the videos, but I think this should really be mentioned here as well. As others mentioned in the last video, the instability is because you take the top 3000 of the dictionary, which are different every time. You should call all_word.most_common(3000) to get the top 3000 most common ones, now you get a random selection.",True

@enmattiskan,2016-01-15T12:05:38Z,2,Good tutorial! I have one question though: Won't the saved classifier will be trained on a subset that partially overlaps with the testing subset of a subsequent run (since they are shuffled differently each time)?,True
