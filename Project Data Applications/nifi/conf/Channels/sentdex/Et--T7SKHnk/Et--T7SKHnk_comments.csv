@tinkoo18,2020-10-16T12:06:36Z,0,Many people seem to have an issue with the Continue button. Even I was facing the same issue but it was because I had not made changes to the buttons by adding game_loop and quitgame in the lines of code to play and quit. I went back to the 15th Tutorial on this topic and followed whatever he did and voila!  Everything is working now.,True
@sennabullet,2020-06-20T03:06:15Z,0,"@sentdex...I know this series of videos are years old, but i just discovered them recently...in my attempt to get more comfortable with python programming in a fun way. For what it is worth...I just wanted to send you a huge THANK YOU for making these videos. 17 sessions in, I am bummed that the end is near. I like the short bite-sized sessions. I like your casual (and entertaining) teaching style. I like that you show us your coding mistakes and debugging (super valuable learning opportunities). While I am still far from competent as a Python programmer...I have understood your lessons well enough to modify your code and make some additional functionalities in my version of the racing game. Solidifying Python understanding by making fun little games has to be the best way to begin the programming journey. Once again...thank you.",True
@garvitgarg6749,2020-06-10T07:47:38Z,0,Bro my continue button is not working while I pause my game it redirects to quit the game,True
@Chrix1996,2020-02-15T19:02:39Z,0,"Hi, I have followed along your videoes and managed to do a pause function which have 5 buttons; continue, restart, controls, rules and quit. if you click on ""Rules"" or ""Controls"", a function to blit a image of the rules/controls will happen. I've managed to go from main menu -> controls/rules -> main menu.  If i start the game, pause and click on the ""controls"" or ""rules"" it will blit the rules/controls image, but i cant manage to return to the game/pause menu.  Is there a good/easy way to do this? :)",True
@Gandalfbaws,2019-08-30T09:04:13Z,2,it did not work when i pressed continue but when i deleted pause = True in the def paused() function it worked,True
@kefeimo908,2019-06-21T06:47:17Z,0,"Nice video as always. One simple thoughts. To avoid using global variables (because sometimes it can be troublesome), one solution is check button_press and return that state, i.e.    def button(msg, x, y, w, h, color_inact, color_act, action=None): ...    # button action     if x + w > mouse_pos[0] > x and y + h > mouse_pos[1] > y:         pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, color_act, (x, y, w, h))         if mouse_click[0] == 1:             button_press = True             if action is not None:                 action()     else:         pygame.draw.rect(gameDisplay, color_inact, (x, y, w, h)) ...   return button_press   then in game_pause(), one can check button_press and jump out of the while loop, i.e.   def game_pause():          pause = True     while pause:         for event in pygame.event.get():             if event.type == pygame.QUIT:                 game_quit() ...    continue_press = button(msg='continue!', x=150, y=450, w=100, h=50, color_inact=green, color_act=green_bright)         if continue_press:             pause = False ...",True
@louie8722,2018-12-23T00:25:08Z,1,"If your quit button is not working, you probably kept the strings in episode 15. Go back to that episode and watch closer to the end when he changes the ""play"" and ""quit"" strings to game_loop and quitgame. I had trouble with that too.",True
@thinboxdictator6720,2018-11-07T17:51:34Z,0,"Is this wrong use of code? : # in pause / intro , instead of button(...  I did declare  continue / start  button like this: pause = button(""Continue"",150,450,100,50,green,bright_green,""pause"")  # and then in  button function just :  if action == game_loop or action == ""pause"":                 return False # and at the end of button() return True  ... is that bad use of code, not something I should do? because this is way easier to understand to me and I guess you can change  the last argument to something like ""toggle"" to make it smoother",True

@SnowyGlory,2018-04-09T20:19:24Z,0,"My buttons work perfectly when drawn (thank you for the tutorials) however, I cannot seem to make a button that has an image as the display. Initially, I was hoping that I could make the button transparent and after some searching around I discovered that pygame does not support transparent shapes. Do you by chance have any recommendations on how to use an image as a button, I have thought about hiding the button...... nevermind, I just came up with a solution while typing this out XD.   Thank you again for the tutorials!!!!",True
