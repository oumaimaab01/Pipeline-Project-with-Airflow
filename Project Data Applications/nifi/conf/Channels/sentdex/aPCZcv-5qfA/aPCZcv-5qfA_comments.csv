@Kuldotha,2022-08-29T20:43:25Z,0,"Not sure if it's mentioned before, but what you said about quantum entanglement and when you change one the other changes too, is incorrect. The entanglement itself is more like this; You have two colored marbles in a dark bag, one blue and one red. Now you take one out blindly and put it in another bag and move them away from each other. They are both blue and red at the same time, they are both in their superposition. Now, if you take your marble out of the bag and look at it, it collapses into one of the options, in this case blue. Now, because the marbles were entangled, you _know_ the other has to be red, you don't even have to look at it. So no information is sent past the speed of light because the information basically already is there, you know they will be opposites, you just don't know which one is sent across the universe until one of them is looked at.",True

@tetlamed,2019-12-27T05:30:17Z,0,"List of factual problems here: 1. At 1:32 you say that a 0 is low and a 1 is high. Often (e.g. in flash memory) this is reversed 2. At 1:59 you say that two characteristics define a quantum system, superposition and entanglement. In actuality, a number of characteristics define a quantum system, you just cherry picked your favorite two 3. At 3:05 you say, ""if 2 qubits are entangled, a change in one causes a change in another one..."" A change in one doesn't *cause* anything, any more than checking the weather *changes* the weather so it'll be different when your friend checks it. The qubits were always going to read connected information, there's no cause and effect about it, though admittedly this is rather nuanced and can be confusing at first 4. At 4:10 you correct yourself to say that a qubit can have one of three states, zero, one, or both. A qubit can represent any state between zero and one, so infinitely many states per bit, though this amounts to far less computation power than you'd think after collapse 5. At 4:36, you say a classical computer can represent 2 * n states. This is sort of true, though discussed below by Daniel Ro 6. At 42:28, you say it's simulating a perfect quantum machine and therefore lacks noise. Take a look at that chart and tell me there's no noise   Overall, this video does a pretty great job at demonstrating how to use a quantum computer, but not how to get a quantum computer to do something useful. If only you had gone over using quantum computing to solve actual problems, even if those problems are more efficiently solved by a classical computer with today's quantum computers, this would have been extremely useful.

@brandonberisford,2019-12-09T13:03:51Z,1,"I'm about to have my bachelors degree in physics and do my research related to quantum information. Allow me to explain entanglement. If two particles are entangled what we mean is that their quantum states are entangled. The be more specific, If the probability of measuring particle B in some state before measurement and after measurement changes if we only interact with particle A. The particles are entangled. This probability change happens instantly to our understanding. However we can't really get any information from these particles. We can do something called quantum teleportation which takes advantage of entanglement. Say Bob and Alice were together a long time ago. When they were together they made a pair of entangled particles (Bell States). They then separated and years later Alice has some information stored in an arbitrary qubit she wants to send bob. Alice can do a series of operations (quantum logic gate operations) on her pair of the entangled particle and the qubit she wants to send and it will give her some final quantum state that when measured she can determine the state of bob's particle. Theres 4 different possibilities here and one of them is the qubit we wish to send. So in a sense by Alice just interacting with her particles shes managed to change bobs particle state into the information she wants to send. What has bob been doing this whole time? Nothing. Just sitting there. So how does Bob know what state his particle is in? Well Alice has to tell Bob. This is the caveat. Alice must still use some classical channel to communicate to bob, say call his cellphone, and tell him what state she measured (therefore telling bob what state his particle is in). So while entanglement seems to violate relativity, smart people have figured out that information transfer still is limited classically and can't be transmitted faster than light. I hope this helped :)",True

Determining the sidereal time of birth is easy enough for any Computer, hell just a simple human can do it. But then, trying to size down the particular psychological profile of such birth time (which is a simple information stating the initial state of the 'system' - but then in turn, that initial state is constantly compared to the current (present) state or sidereal time and we get everyday life.. that's in theory ;), can we actually get a precise calculation of every parameter to determine the unique profile this initial state (this particular sidereal time) equals to ?! There's only 9 planets to consider, but also 12 houses and 12 signs which are derived from those 9 planets definition and depending on the angle (aspects)  and configuration (and transits) of all those planets, houses and sign, you get a different personality ever so slightly. This in turn could even be applied to gaming industry of today to randomly generate characters to elaborated personalities that would all work according to a 'logic' and would at least, fit together in this virtual gaming world generated. I know they can make generators that will choose words to write you a story (hell, they can make generators to make you an image), you just need to input guiding parameters. That sidereal time could be a guiding parameter to generate a personality.

They also give 2^n possible bitstrings, which also corresponds to the number basis states for a n qubit quatum computer. The distinction is just that that a classical computer's state can only ever be one of these 2^n bitstrings at any given time, whereas a quantum computer's state can be in a ""superposition"" of any 2^n basis states.   For example,  n=3 bits gives 2^3=8 bitstrings: 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111",True

@szaryacer,2019-11-30T15:59:25Z,3,"Just wanted to clarify the quantum entanglement. The information is not travelling faster than the speed of light. Suppose we have two electrons, and we entangle them to be of opposite spins (one is 1, the second is 0). Now we move them 1 light year apart from each other. So when we want to measure the spin of one of the electrons,  and the result is 1, we instantly know that the second eletron will be 0. But here is the thing. The information from the electron 1 light year from us isn't reaching us instanly. We already knew about the entanglement when we seperated them in the first place, so no laws are violated. As long as we know about the entanglement, we can measure spins (either opposite or the same) of both the electrons, regardless of their distance between each other. Hope that helps a bit. (:",True

@sgtrpcommand3778,2019-11-30T15:54:36Z,7,"I like your explanation of Q-bits but one thing that I always found hard to imagine with the large scale examples (so coffee in a mug is a large scale example) is that there is definitely coffee or tea or water in there, we as observers just don't know it.  That's the difference between classical and quantum - in quantum, an electron (for example) will exhibit multiple behaviours in a way that is actually much more like a wave. It's not ""here"" or ""there"" (although you can technically measure position, but you lose certainty in momentum then... thanks Heisenberg...) but it's a wave with probabilities. So two electrons interacting is a lot like two waves in a pond. That's what becomes so hard with quantum, is that it's so physically intangible with large scale objects.  I'm also only a 4th year physics student so I'm bound to get called up on something I said or something I explained poorly, but that's the way I understood it :) thanks again for the video!

Basically the ""simulated annealing"" algorithm's quantum version. Given a loss function (I think it has to be quadratic, not sure) and the configuration space, a DWave computer will try to find the optimal solution using quantum tunneling. It is useful in tasks like drug development, spacecraft design - especially the fact that it can kinda solve the local minimum problem by tunneling. But it can't solve RSA nor break crypto like Google and IBM's.  Think it like Boombe (the computer that cracks Enigma code) vs vacuum tube computers.  Source: My professor's rant years ago.",True
