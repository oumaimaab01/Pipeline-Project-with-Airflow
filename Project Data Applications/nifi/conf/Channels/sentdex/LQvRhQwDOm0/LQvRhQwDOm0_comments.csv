Now, is a RTX 3070 (mobile) with just 6 GByte of memory sufficient to render ML models or should I buy a standard office laptop without a dedicated accelerator GPU and rent cloud computing CPU / GPU time even for my experiments?",True

@Iyht,2022-04-11T08:09:46Z,1,"Hi, I really have to thank you, back in the day when your channel was just starting I was able to find you tutorials here and they really helped me to learn how to code in python. That was like  10 years ago and since then I was able to learn a lot of other programing languages from python to Assembly a C++ and all the in between. I really think that if I wasn't able to find you tutorials back then I would probably had quitted trying to learn to program by myself because back then the learning resources existed but they were very poorly explained and in my opinion they never got to the point to become useful to me. It is the clarity of your explanations and examples that really made programming clicked in my mind and since then whenever I found something new to learn about python or I need to remember how to do something I come back here to re-watch your tutorials. I'm really happy seen the success that your channel had in this years because you really deserve it.  Thanks for all the help during this years!!!.",True

@dolodestinations7628,2022-04-02T01:05:07Z,0,"hey there! love the videos. quick question. you have said that a saved model is essentially just weights and biases. and a training model is updating weights and biases by themselves to determine optimization. is there a way to see these weights and biases. so you have 3 columns, is there a way to see the weight of each column for the best performing model?",True
