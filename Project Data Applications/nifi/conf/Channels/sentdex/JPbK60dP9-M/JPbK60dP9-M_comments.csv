Essentially what I am saying, how were you able to learn and be able to reciprocate the knowledge of various computer languages? Did you read and merely conducted vast repetitions of coding? I find myself having difficulty following documentation of many languages, in order to write programs. I understand this is a personal problem of mine, but I am genuinely interested and desperate to become an exemplar in Computer Science.

@mikeroitman1830,2016-12-21T03:10:06Z,2,"Hi SentDex- New account but long-time subscriber. Thanks for getting content out on such a consistent basis! I imagine that's quite hard, but it's really appreciated by your audience!  What do you think of Rust? Given your basis of curiosity around C/C++, are there any newer languages that offer a 'systems programming' platform that interest you? I've taken to using Rust Lang, but I know that others like Google's Go Lang are catching on throughout the programming world.  Also, I'd guess you get a lot of questions on web programming, as that's in high demand. How much of 'Cloud Computing' do you think is an extension of the web? From the standpoint of someone who's interesting in programming lot's of low-level projects in a system's environment, do you think that cloud computing might offer more work along those lines (as opposed to the feel of a dynamic environment like JS)? What sort's of services do you think will be demanded in the form of small contract work for cloud computing? Maybe a starting point to answering that last question is to ask how broad the scope of cloud computing is? Does it create demand for 1-man-team consultants, all the way up to companies like Amazon and Google? Or is most of the demand localized around big companies (i.e. AWS).  Thanks for your time! I really enjoy your tutorials, as well as your Q&A.",True
