@rsuriyop,2023-04-15T04:23:02Z,0,All of this programming and re-engineering looks pretty complex. I was pretty intent on getting an XGO Mini Lite for simple fun. But I don't want to bother doing any of this complex stuff. I'm just interested in making it go wherever I want under my control or to set it free on some kind of autonomous self-exploration mode.,True
