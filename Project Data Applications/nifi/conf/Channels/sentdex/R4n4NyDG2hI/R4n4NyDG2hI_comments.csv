@Grinder-one,2014-11-03T23:54:48Z,0,Excellent. A bit advanced for me as I've only recently started to look into coding although I picked up quite a lot of basic programming knowledge some 20+ years ago and am currently bouncing between C++ and Python but finding GFX abit on the extreme side. But watching this leaves me hopeful of perhaps seeing the birth of a 3D game engine ? :) Thanks for uploading and keep up the good work.,True
