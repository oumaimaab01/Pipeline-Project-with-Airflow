@tuhinmukherjee8141,2021-02-09T17:11:35Z,0,"Also, shouldn’t we have normalized the grayscale data , ie. subtract it by it’s mean and divide it by it’s standard deviation such that it becomes much easier for the model to work with it.",True
@tuhinmukherjee8141,2021-02-09T16:17:09Z,0,"Hey, maybe we could take into account the machine learning model’s prediction you built before into account as well. Also, I feel that your forward, left and right functions are a little erroneous. I might be wrong.",True

@flynn3203,2019-05-28T18:18:10Z,0,"Ok, for me this tutorial has been fantastic, and I really appreciate all of the work you (Sentdex) have put in. But at this point, I'm now starting to get loads of errors when testing, something to do with access denied.   I've basically wiped all of my progress and in the end copied everything over from GitHub, since doing that, there are three problems: I don't understand it, it doesn't work, I'm now depressed because of it :(.  I would have loved to have got this to work on my pc!! - Maybe a revisit is due?",True
@lionkor98,2019-02-14T13:10:07Z,0,"I know this is wayyyyyy too late but still  1. It was trained with GREY data but is now fed BGR? 2. You messed up the right[:len(forward)] thing in your corrections there, still 3. You reshaped and resized, dont think that's needed.",True

@wolfgtweb,2018-11-27T00:28:31Z,0,"I know this is an old series and you may have done this already, but I see the Windows shake feature has screwed you a couple times during this series. You can disable that feature pretty easily if you don't legitimately use it. Just a thought. Also, you might want to check out a little program called UltraMon. You would really like the monitor management features. I enjoy your videos, keep up the great work.",True

@dniam9859,2018-06-15T19:11:53Z,3,"I don't think you trained the model correctly here... While recording the training data you should've driven slightly off road every now and then and then center the scooter back in the lane so that the CNN will learn that when it seems like we are going off road, we have to press A to go back in lane and stuff like that.",True

@akirarenbokoji4464,2017-04-21T23:23:56Z,7,Question: So if you were to tackle a taxi mission would it go something like -  1. Train data to pick up a mission 2. Train data to check the map once a mission is accepted. 3. Train data to do the mission. continue training data on specific tasks then combine it to be applied at a later time  or  Train data to pick up a mission and do all tasks required to complete it in one fell swoop. Then repeat until you have a large amount of training data.  This is great fun and I'm learning tons.,True
@akirarenbokoji4464,2017-04-21T20:24:17Z,0,"Question: When did WIDTH & HEIGHT change from 80, 60 to 160, 120. Is this a preference change or something super important that I should be aware of. At the moment I only understand that 80, 60 is quite large for CNN. I'm assuming results were better increasing it to 160, 120?",True
@akirarenbokoji4464,2017-04-21T15:39:31Z,0,"I'm having trouble understanding what WIDTH and HEIGHT is for. I'm assuming its the shape of the tensors? If I increased the inputs from 3 [W, A, D] to 5 what would I have to update to reflect the changes or can I keep it as is and have the model fit? Would I have to change the WIDTH and HEIGHT?",True
@jacobdavidcunningham1440,2017-04-19T16:24:54Z,4,"Wow it's really fascinating to think of the ""algorithm"" to drive. Things get larger as they approach you, left side (oncoming traffic) different speed, heading/waypoint, sky/ground, color difference/road boundary, awesome.  edit: I also wonder if it's based on the frame rate of the game, the progression from each frames for computation. Not only would your computer have to be able to play the game but do the processing in real time to control the game. Not sure man that's nuts the pixel pixel analysis for figuring out what things are/direction/approaching/leaving... ray tracing? I don't know  good luck and GOD SPEED!",True

@martinpalsson490,2017-04-19T09:41:17Z,0,"Hi sentdex! Did you consider putting some kind of (median-) filter on the input to the ai (or the neural network)? Say, you save the 4 latest screens + the current one, compare values and send the median (or the screen corresponding to current median) to the ai (network)?  I've done this on my own self driving RC-car, and it made it maneuver smoother. Less jitter in the input to the regulator. My setup was quite different though, only measuring distance to walls. What you could do is to calculate how far off the center of the lane you are.",True
