I had to call canvas.get_tk_widget().pack() after making the toolbar. When I do that everything works as expected. canvas._tkcanvas.pack() doesn't seem to work although maybe the toolbar is being put behind the figure. I am using matplotlib 1.5.0 and python 3.5.",True

@Mike-yf1lj,2015-08-17T23:36:01Z,0,"Thank you for the tutorials. I was wondering if you know of a way that you can select a region on the plot, and when you select that region, store the x and y boundaries of the selected region. For example, on your plot your x axis goes from 1 - 8 and your y axis goes from 1 - 9. If you selected the region x[4:7] and y[2:6], then the values x1=4, x2=7, y1=2, and y2=6 are stored, and can be used else where in the program.",True

But there is something that has always bothered me and didn't manage to find anything about it on the net mainly: Why is """"""self"""""" the second argument in some of your instances of module classes? Shouldn't it be the first argument as a convention?  In which situation does it appear as a second parameter?  I tried switching the positions but got errors so a little help would be really appreciated in understanding this :).",True
