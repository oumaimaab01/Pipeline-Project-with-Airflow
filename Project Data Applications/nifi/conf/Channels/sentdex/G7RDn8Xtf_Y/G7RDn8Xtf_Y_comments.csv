@ilmacs8827,2020-01-11T22:16:58Z,0,"I already tried this, and I've spent almost the past year writing my own version of keras (completely from scratch, without even numpy), but I recently realized that I need to quit this project, or at least I wouldn't be able to use it professionally as I hoped, and here's why: one reason is that it's completely written in python, instead of being let's say, a wrapper for a c++ library.  And compared to other languages, python is probably one of the slowest languages at runtime. And when I tried to train one of my NNs on the MNIST dataset, it took 8 hours to train 5 epochs, when with the same hardware, it took seconds to do the same in keras. It's probably because keras uses c++ and cuda to get the GPU to take part in the computer. But even with just the CPU it still took like 3 minutes in keras. The second flaw is completely my fault: when I started coding my version for numpy to build my NNs on, I were just getting started with the theory. At that time, I thought about  neural networks as just flat multi-layer perceptrons. So I never considered the fact that sooner or later, I would need to implement multi-dimensional tensors for more advanced layer types such as convolutions, so I coded my array type by just considering it as a 2D matrix, and not as a ndarray as it's called in numpy. Sure these are problems which can be fixed, especially the second one, but I need a break. I hope I will learn something from this course, and can't wait for it to start, and maybe it will help me continue with my own quest (I've called my library ""QuickBrain"" btw, lol)",True

@TheOriginalJohnDoe,2020-01-11T05:46:13Z,0,"One thing I hope is a bit more explanations of the things you're doing. For example: If this is from scratch I presume I am getting more explanation about what an ""activation function"" is and how this affects the outcome, along with the mathematical functions such as ReLU. You don't have to go into details, but it would've saved me some research on these terms in the previous Machine Learning course if you simply would've said: ""ReLU basically transforms negative values to 0. Positive values remain the same as they are"". That would've made me following along much easier, since I'm still new to Machine Learning and not everyone's mathematics is this great. Math can be hard along with all the functions, especially if you don't know most of the functions that you're doing.   Besides that; keep going and I look really forward to this course! ‚ù§Ô∏è",True
