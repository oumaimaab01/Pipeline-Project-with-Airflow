@AniruddhaMarathe,2014-08-07T15:59:22Z,1,"Hello, Thanks so much for all the videos, great help to anyone trying to experiment with Python.  Just wanted to point one thing (not Python) : The IF, ELIF and ELSE block for sell has a flaw (at 12:34) - if the signal is sell but there isn't enough stock in the portfolio we should sell whatever we have. You mentioned this, but the code is just changed the value of change, not adjusting funds, stockHoldings and current Valuations  One more : A similar logic can also be applied for buy, i.e if there is a buy signal (of more than 1 change) but enough funds are not available then buy whatever is available.  Lastly, irrespective whether we do any action / adjust on holding or not we can still always do a re calculation of currentValuation as the prices are going to change without or without us buying or selling. This will make the graphs for performance analysis more smoother.  Got introduced to your channel for learning sentiment analysis, but simply got hooked onto everything else too :)  Thanks again.",True
