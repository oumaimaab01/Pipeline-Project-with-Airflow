@rbaleksandar,2022-03-24T16:11:18Z,0,Just listing the contents of a directory and trying to load those - as seen in the video - cannot result in anything but some exceptions being thrown.  Each pet folder contains the images plus a database (I assume it's MSQL since we download it from Microsoft; much better would be to use a simple CSV file and this is something I recommend doing when processing the dataset). Loading blindly files using OpenCV is not good. In addition there are apparently plenty of corrupted images in that dataset so don't be surprised if you get messages such as       Corrupt JPEG data: 217 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd9  or    OpenCV(4.5.5) D:\bld\libopencv_1641992799878\work\modules\imgproc\src\resize.cpp:4052: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !ssize.empty() in function 'cv::resize'  The try...catch block is essential to prevent your loading procedure from failing. One of the most annoying things that can happen when working with large datasets is to load 99.9% of the samples and then due to some file being corrupt everything goes to waste. It gets even worse if the dataset is so large you need hours or even days to load it.,True
@rbaleksandar,2022-03-24T15:33:12Z,0,"If possible try to avoid mixing OpenCV with PyTroch. You will end up wasting a lot of time converting the NumPy arrays from OpenCV into PyTorch Tensor data structures. The way image data is stored in OpenCV is not the same as in PyTorch so you will have to do data type conversions, data transformations etc.  I wasted two weeks hunting down something as simple as changing the NumPy datatype of my OpenCV image before converting it into a Tensor. It was a nightmare!  Also, probably because this tutorial is now 1.5 year old and at that time it was not available in terms of documentation, checkout how to implement datasets as iterable PyTorch Dataset objects. This will allow you to load your data in a more PyTorch-way. You might also want to read something about creating your own dataloaders by inheriting the DataLoader class.",True

If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.""   This is because we are putting the image contents and the one-hot encoded label together in a list (they're obviously different dimensions so this creates a ragged list) and save the list of all of these to a .npy file.

@martinmartin6300,2020-04-04T14:20:01Z,1,"Yeah numpy load is complaining because by default it does not want to use pickle. The numpy format is really meant to be used for numeric data, only; data which is some numpy data object such as arrays. Generally, you can serialize your objects with numpy, too (it uses pickle to do so) but the latter is generally not recommended (as of pickle documentation) since the binary data format of pickle changes here and there over the course of time, so it's not reliable. The clean way is to introduce some converter functions/methods to convert everything to numpy arrays, first, before saving and loading it. However, you can get away with it when you argue that the saved "".npy"" file is not meant to be a long term storage format (e.g. for tracibility) but rather some intermediate step of the training pipe which you can easily rebuild as you have implemented here, too.",True

@martinmartin6300,2020-04-04T13:37:19Z,0,"Yeah the condensing due to the convolution/filter is more like a side effect. It is worth mentioning that there is another mode where you can assume that all pixels which are beyond the image are zero. This provides the possibility to keep the dimension of your image the same. However, this leads to the issue that the pixels at the edges get less filtered than the pixels in the inner part of your image. This might or might not be a problem. Therefore, most of the time the people stick to the type of convolution that you have shown here. However, if you have rather small images and you still want to have a larger number of convolutional layers, you might not be able to have that much because at some layer you already condensed all images to a single pixel. In order to overcome this, you could use the other mode of convolution (after decreasing pooling size to something like 2x2 already of course).",True

While the resize is throwing the exception it's actually because the imread is returning None. The first example is 10125.jpg in the cat directory. If you open that file in a text editor you'll see it begins with ""GIF"" so the problem is probably even though all files end with "".jpg"" some of them are different image format.   Fortunately imghdr is in the standard library, you can filter out the files which aren't easy to read by imread. You can easily work with  png, bmp, and jpeg,. As for gif you can keep but you have to do extra work on it by capturing the first frame of the gif and convert to gray-scale after reading.  Some files returned None for imghdr like 10404.jpg in cats, it appears to be a RAW file as near the beginning of the file it has ""KONICA.MINOLTA.DIGITAL.CAMERA.8BIM"", these I skipped.",True

@harkishansinghbaniya2784,2019-10-05T15:48:21Z,22,"I would like to request a video on practically handling imbalanced datasets. It is not always practical to throw away data with imbalanced class. For e.g. if we are to predict fraudulent transactions with credit card datasets, it's highly likely to have a huge imbalance in dataset like 5% fraudulent transaction and the rest 95% are not. In that case, if we remove 90% of the data to balance it out than first of all we will lose a huge amount of data and then it will also unbalance the distribution of the dataset because there is only a rare chance for fraudulent transactions so, we will get a lot of false positives with the data removal method. By the really love your tutorials. ‚ù§Ô∏è",True
