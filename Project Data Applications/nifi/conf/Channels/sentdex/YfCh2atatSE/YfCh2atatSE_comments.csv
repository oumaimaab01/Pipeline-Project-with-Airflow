@atrumluminarium,2020-05-11T02:51:46Z,0,Your ml models seem to be so consistently wrong in the back test. Almost there's a factor of -1 in your signal,True
@MrEstebanEscudero,2019-06-26T22:31:42Z,0,Good video.,True
@DAcasado,2017-06-04T09:47:08Z,0,My leverage goes mad and starts being 26 from the first day. What is going wrong in my code? Any ideas? I think it it opening and closin positions minutely when it should be doing it daily.,True
@joaogarciadossantosjoao4621,2017-02-12T21:45:03Z,0,"hello, when doing try and except how do you indent the whole code? ctrl+altgr+closing bracket thanks for your response",True
@sidaliu8989,2016-10-05T13:54:42Z,0,"DEAR Harrison, I must say that I love your tutorial VERY MUCH! They really showed me a lot!  After I watched your tutorial on Recurrent Neural Network, I realized that what you were doing here is using 4 algos regardless of sequence. Why not using RNN to predict the prices? Hope you can append another tutorial of how to use RNN in finance use. Thank you again for sharing your super power with us.",True
@BatMan-kb2lh,2016-02-22T06:07:40Z,0,"Hi,  Thanks for doing this! I really appreciate it! However, I do have a question.  When I was initially running the algorithm the first time. I accidentally put elif p == -2: instead of p == -1: However, that error made the backtest produce much better result. However, I don't understand why such phenomena occurs?  Thanks in Advance!",True
@luizbattistel7762,2015-12-01T02:15:10Z,3,"Hi,   if you have an algorithm that is great at being wrong, wont an algorith that does exactly the opposite be great at being right? thanks",True
@superblondmale,2015-09-04T14:35:06Z,0,"Hi,  I 'figured out' a simple strategy that beats the market. Calculate the prediction as   su = sum([p1, p2, p3, p4]) p= 1 if su == 4 else (-1 if s <=-2 else 0)  Everything else stays the same. If all classifiers predict 'buy' (su==4) then buy else if 3 or 4 classifiers predict ""sell"" then sell.",True
@redstoneisawesome9336,2015-08-07T14:15:35Z,0,"And, to go along with that, I am making a CPU module(you can get CPU specs). I am working on the processor's getting clock speed. When I am done, can you review the module?",True
@blesshispinklipstick,2015-08-05T19:01:52Z,0,Do you have any videos where you talk about sentiment vs trends in the stock market and a strategy to help find those?,True
@codegeek8256,2015-08-04T15:57:48Z,0,Hi  Are you a trader ?,True
@redstoneisawesome9336,2015-08-01T23:23:00Z,0,"Hey, +sentdex Â can you make a python module that converts python, to c, and then c to assembly. I understand assembly, but I want to make an OS, to make it easier to create OSes Just if your wondering, I know assembly, but not C. I have not found a way to directly convert python to assembly. Thanks, if you can!",True
@xxpreoxx,2015-07-28T21:50:52Z,0,"unrelated to this tutorial, but is there a way to a) create a moving average for a talib function or should i just rewrite the functions for my own needs? b) source price data or function outputs for previous days' closes?  any help is very much appreciated and these tutorials are a-mazing",True
@1tczx93,2015-07-19T13:21:31Z,0,"Hi Sentdex,  I have been trying to debug my error of Execution Timeout. Changed the time period to a shorter one and checked my codes. Still cant find any problem with it. Would you mind linking the sample code so I can debug it easier? i cant find it in the url you posted.  Thanks",True
