@ydb1976yt,2021-09-25T15:34:43Z,0,"OK, some insights: 1. the order of the bits in the x axis in the histogram, it makes some sense if you would think of it like we think of decimal numbers: if we have a column of numbers - we would align them so that the decimal points of all the numbers are aligned, if there is a number with more digits - those digits would stick out to the left (that would be the 3rd qubit) the digits we already use would be in the familiar (right side - close to the decimal point) places. 2. around the noise in the 38:00 - 3 qubits #2 rotated pi/4. found out that quickest way to cancel the noise (instead of 3qu/1c bits replay) is simply to remove the h(0) and h(1) - no noise... 3. so, the ratio for the #2 qubit was 0:~0.853 1:~0.147 surprised me, I was expecting 0:0.75 1:0.24 - then I checked something out - and it shows very good answer: if we look at the tip of the vector and project it (on the Z axis) it will be 1-cos(pi/4) under the top of the sphere if you take this and consider the ""Z"" as 2 (it is indeed 2 radii) - and we look at the proportion of what we got against 2 - it seems very similar to the result: (1-(cos(pi/4 rad)))/2=0.1464466094",True

This is still a pure state. Than the cnot entangles the two qubits BUT unknowing the result of a measurement on the first qubit. And here comes the so called ""statistically mixed"" state: now there is 50%50% chance for both qubits of being on ket[0] or ket[1].

@ColinBroderickMaths,2019-12-07T14:27:27Z,42,"The reason the two qubits don't have state at 22:35 ish is because they're entangled. Entanglement literally means that the constituent systems don't have independent states, they only have their shared state, which can't be represented on the Bloch sphere (since it's for 1-qubit systems). There are ways you can sort of consider them to have independent state, but it's much more complicated.  Hadamard is a rotation just like all other fundamental quantum logic gates, it's just not around one of the main axes so it's a bit hard to interpret on the Bloch sphere. All fundamental quantum logic gates are unitary which for these purposes is the same as being a rotation (but that rotation may be in a complex many-dimensional space). It's also not just for putting things into superposition, but taking them out as well. It you apply it twice you'll get out of superposition.  At 22:43 onwards I think some of the confusion comes from the fact that you've entangled qubit 2 with the combination of qubits 0 and 1, but qubits 0 and 1 are not actually entangled with each other. So e.g. measuring only qubit 0 does not impact qubit 1, and gives you partial information on qubit 2. I think you're right about the bit ordering though. Qubit states are normally written in a big-endian way, so qubit 0 would be in the last position. This is no different to regular binary numbers in computer science where bit 0 is the least significant bit. This is potentially confusing if you're not often operating at the level of bits.  Some of the confusing directionality on the Bloch sphere is due to the fact that state vector amplitudes are complex numbers. You square (more accurately, multiply the number by it's complex conjugate) these amplitudes to get probabilities and this squaring is why different-looking complex vectors give the same output. States are generally normalized since certain operations only make sense in that case, which is why your partially entangled vectors from the previous paragraph didn't have unit length: their state was only (fully) defined in the 3-qubit space and that is the space in which they must be normalized.  I wouldn't suggest you actually do anything like this by hand, but any missing 1- or 2-qubit gates/operations are just the matrix products of existing 1- and 2-qubit operations, and higher-dimensional gates are the Kronecker product of those operations to give higher-dimensional operators. So any combination does exist if you can write it in a mathematically consistent way. Building it into a real machine is another story of course!  My master's thesis is in quantum computation and I currently work as a machine learning software developer, so it looks like our interests overlap quite a bit.  My master's was in mathematical physics rather than computer science or engineering. I'd be happy to talk to you more about qc if you're interested.

@michael-nef,2019-12-07T01:29:08Z,0,"At 28:00 you say that you think the bit values are around the wrong way. I think you're correct because: You have 8 ""possible"" final measurements:  000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111  we know that if the final bit is flipped (the one you apply X to), then the conditional bits MUST both be measured as 1 (because it's if(qubit1 && qubit2): X(qubit3)) so our new ""logically possible"" measurements are: 000, ---, 010, ---, 100, ---, ---, 111  notice 001 is not a possible measurement, which is shown on the graph.  Also, I could absolutely be wrong, but I think the final distribution of probabilities would still be 1/4 each. because there's a 1/2 chance of qubit1 being a 1 or 0, and there's a 1/2 chance of qubit2 being 1 or 0. So,  00_ will happen 1/4 of the time, 01_ will happen 1/4 of the time, 10_ will happen 1/4 of the time and 11_ will happen 1/4 of the time. Given that, it's pretty straightforward to see that qubit3's measured value will be totally dependent on the values of qubit1 and qubit2 and you can fill in the ""_""'s by hand.",True

@theanalogueguy7528,2019-12-06T15:24:49Z,0,The value or qubuit value that is closest to the X axis on the histograms is the value of q0. To make this easier if you put the qubit values on the y-axis where the probabilities are  the number furthest to the right = q0. The way you said is correct they are reversed true!,True
@linsthankachan5506,2019-12-06T15:16:45Z,1,Can you make a tutorial series for robot operating system...there is no good guide anywhere and your tutorials are way better than others...,True
@ahmadayazamin3313,2019-12-06T15:11:25Z,0,What is the benefit of running simulators on classical machines? Can it actually perform computations similar to that of an actual quantum computer this way? I am quite interested why it is done.,True
@gm4984,2019-12-06T15:11:05Z,0,"I have a stupid question, since we don't know the value until we measure it, could a cosmic ray influence the qbit before the observation?",True
@shauryashrivastava8965,2019-12-06T15:04:02Z,0,Whoa !! Wicked cool series on Quantum computing !! Will you also bring a Python 3.8 and a Python for Blockchain and Cryptocurrency development tutorial series. It would really be a blast !! Keep up the good work.,True
@allegrostein,2019-12-06T14:58:51Z,0,"I had a doubt, how can an engineer pursue studies in quantum computing?",True
@abdulrashid1621,2019-12-06T14:56:50Z,0,Was waiting for this episode keep up the excellent work 💓,True
@talhatariqyuluqatdis,2019-12-06T14:54:33Z,4,Youre right when you say we cant afford to not get into this. You could make Billions out of this.,True
@KucharJosef,2019-12-06T14:51:58Z,4,Quick question: How can we know that these companies are not just simulating  quantum computers on classical computers with added noise?,True
@rohithvishaal,2019-12-06T14:50:12Z,0,just awesome,True
@logiclegend8219,2019-12-06T14:48:01Z,2,Last time I was this early skynet was taking over the world.,True
@sigma4805,2019-12-06T14:47:48Z,0,Porg mug!,True
@ahmadanis9930,2019-12-06T14:46:37Z,0,❤️,True
@talhatariqyuluqatdis,2019-12-06T14:44:10Z,23,Why the hell dont you have at least 10 Million subscribers? You are a must watch for most programmers.,True
@Stinosko,2019-12-03T20:51:47Z,1,👻,True
@its-tony,2019-12-03T20:46:17Z,30,Can’t wait to see how far you take this. Really enjoy your python series.,True
