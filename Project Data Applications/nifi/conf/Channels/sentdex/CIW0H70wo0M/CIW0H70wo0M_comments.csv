@Amipotsophspond,2019-12-21T23:30:12Z,1,"the hardest part of build a program should be building the program not be compiling it. it shocks me that is such a horrible aspect to most programing. I think this is being used as a sort of ""paywall"", because of how bad the documentation is or non existence at times. you would think people that must declare everything as part of their jobs would be able to write better documentation that declares concepts and assumes nothing. for ios and android you would think they would make libraries and modules for all popular programing languages just to increases the chance they might get app out of it, that makes them money. instead their programmers are wasting work on finding new ways identify and removing content creators who are also making them money, that have wrong think. that is their business model. this is not such a problem with python as it's pip system is super easy but I have had problems with getting some c++ libraries to even work even on Linux. I first noticed the insiders only paywall aspect to it in solidity that is extremely easy to learn and at least a year ago super hard to actually test on test net and deploy at least if your doing something unique.",True
