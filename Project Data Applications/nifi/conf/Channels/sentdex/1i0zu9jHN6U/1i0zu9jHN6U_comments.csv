@j.hanleysmith8333,2016-12-05T05:56:07Z,0,"@sentdex Hey man, thanks for the awesome tutorials! Was wondering if you could give me some guidance....  I plugged in my own data set, the classifier is 1 or -1. I have about 100 labels for my X data and about 200 data points. Basically I'm looking at the movement of a stock price based on the barometric pressure of 100 different cities.   I'm not getting any errors, the accuracy is showing about .85, which seems good?? My issue is when I plug in known X values that should produce a -1, it is giving 1. No matter what (logical) data I plug in for predictions, it always prints 1, never -1. Not sure where the problem lies or if I'm using the wrong algorithm completely. Thanks a bunch if you are able to help out! Cheers and looking forward to the deep neural nets!!!!",True
