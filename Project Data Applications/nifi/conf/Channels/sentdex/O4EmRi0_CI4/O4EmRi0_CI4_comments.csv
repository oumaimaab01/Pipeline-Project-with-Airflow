@ettmargarin,2023-06-21T22:11:59Z,0,"Hi! There is a model released called WizardLM/WizardCoder-15B-V1.0 that apparently now beat open source LLMs as well as bard and both versions of  Claude, in HumanEval and HumanEval+ benchmark, though it is still right behind ChatGPT 3.5. It is fine tuned for coding, self hostable with ggml versions out, and apparently fast to my knowledge. So, in a lot of ways it seems like a good open source candidate model I guess?",True

@tigoes,2023-06-09T09:48:24Z,0,"The issue with the ""reading from console"" is when your model decides to run a non ending process, like running a web server, it will not receive any output and endup waiting indefinitely. Another problem was that sometimes it chose to run ""cd path"" in one command and then ""npm install"" in another, that wont work well in one command per process scenario.  I tested an approach when a model can ""open_console, close_console, send_command, and read_logs"" which handles this scenario with an async approach.   The problem i faced was that offen the model chose to run the same command again and again even when he has all the logs present in his context and enters some kind of infinite loop of send_command, read logs... However, this might be better now with GPT4.",True
@tigoes,2023-06-09T09:35:01Z,0,"Already tested the concept with my autonomous-dev project that allows GPT to use console, a set of fs actions as well as google search, web scraping, ask human etc... with the goal to build a software based on a given objective. I did let him takes actions without any intervention, i dont know why is everybody tripping out. Ive noticed that he offten chose to search on google for something that is certainly in his training data (like sorting algorithms) just because a human would most likely do so. It is not taking advantage of his large knowledge.  GPT 3.5 was just not good enough to handle anything other than very simple project. It is good to provide example when provided with sufficient information. Not very good when its about taking decisions and tracking progress. One of the issues is most likely related to the fact the model is not fine tunes for this kind of use case.",True

I wrote a class for internet access for research, it can download pdf which it processes and stores in the database.. Semi working, and it has created a few classes to enhance itself.

@WistrelChianti,2023-06-05T02:14:35Z,1,"I never thought of setting the behaviour via pre-filling the conversation with fake/example conversation. That's genius! I've just been using a singular system prompt (although TBF that's all I've needed so far).  I've made something similar but not as extreme. Just an implementation of the chat client in the shell. I agree, its SO much faster to have everything in there rather than going off to the net/web client.  I've added a bunch of other stuff like commands for controlling conversation memory (turning it off or on, clearing, tracking token count etc) as well as code syntax highlight, logging and an option to create a sub shell to start testing stuff out so you can return and keep convo context if you run into issues. Similarly, I've a bunch of command ideas I've not implemented yet and have defo encountered bugs (mainly with the syntax highlighting) but it's working most of the time. Liking your idea about grabbing stuff from the net and feeding it to it for summary etc. I suppose you could have it do a web search, pass it the results and ask it which one it wants to look at, then fetch that back to it etc.  Seems like the possibilities are endless once you get going and it's always so much fun seeing what it does/how it responds.",True

Also tell GPT to tell me what pip packages are required, and it installs them. On any error in the multi step process, feed the errors back to GPT for resolution.  If all else failed, summarize results, with the original ask, and compose it as a new ask. Rinse repeat, works well.",True

@avi7278,2023-06-03T17:43:08Z,28,"Sentdex, good luck. You're about to fall into a deep rabbit hole with this stuff.  It's a fun rabbithole, though.  I ended up doing this really detailed structured setup with gpt4 building out step by step shell commands to handle a user's task input, giving it ""tools"" each having their purpose and structured documentation for commands and their usage (arguments, flags etc).  Then you inevitably try to get it self-reflect and confirm the approach is actually the best, fix its own errors, build its own reusable scripts and add them to a library, and then try to get it to choose the right existing script for the job rather than trying to write a new one for each user task. And then there are the rules, oh the rules.... do this, don't do that, ""you MUST ALWAYS do it like this"". Big, long lists of rules.... And then when you can't quite get it to do what you want, but it's oh so close, then you get to the human in the loop phase, where it does most of the work, but you try to work in some manual guidance into the system to get over that last hump. And finally, you come to realize while this is all very very cool, we're still at least one generation off from REALLY being able to do this thing. At least, that was my conclusion.  And also, python is kind of a sh** language. Oh and there's the cost optimization trying to get it to use 3.5 for tasks that you know it's capable of because boy do thost GPT-4 api costs really start to add up after a while.",True
