@rookiebounty4394,2015-05-03T05:58:12Z,0,"Hi, I have been following your tutorials for a while now and they make complex concepts easy to understand and doesn't drown you under a wave so theory before you can grasp anything, so thanks for making these tutorials.   I noticed that you mostly only cover topics you are using but i thought i'd still ask you if you could do a tutorial on distributed computing with multiple nodes and as a extra i would like to ask you if you could do a proper tutorial on multithreading. Most tutorials i have seen limit them self do 5 or something thread, instead of using the maximum amount. The functions the threads call have nothing to do with each other, meaning they don't attempt to reach a common goal and do not return any values. There doesn't seem to be any threading tutorials that show how to practically use threads for performance. It would be great if you could expand on multithreading where other tutorials don't..   Thank you",True
