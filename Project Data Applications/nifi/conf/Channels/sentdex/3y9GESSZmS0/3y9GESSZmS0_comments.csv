@emnalatrous2954,2019-06-13T21:15:19Z,0,"Hello  i'm trying to calculate the EMA for *a* *day* in c++ i have all all the courses OHLC stored in an array ( an iterator more precisly ) so i understood that i need to get an array of data of size window in which the last closing price is the one from today (and every time i calcuate the average and advance window times with a negative step )having only closing prices based on an formula found in the website investopedia i was able to understand that in order to get the value of EMA i need to maintain the same window( the same in SMA) and then do calculations based on the same window value but the first value in the array which is meant to be the begining date in the array of size window (aka periode ) so is this methode as accurate as the ones you did and is the fact of using all the data  and what does the line a[:window] = a[window] is doing based on the explanation in investopedia  ps : if you have an idea about STL is there an similar way to get the same outcome",True
@kantocoder5046,2019-03-12T23:21:53Z,2,"Your calculation of exponential moving average is incorrect, it should be done in a recursive way.  Here is explanation (from https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_averages):  ・Initial SMA: 10-period sum / 10  ・Multiplier: (2 / (Time periods + 1) ) = (2 / (10 + 1) ) = 0.1818 (18.18%) ・EMA: {Close - EMA(previous day)} x multiplier + EMA(previous day).  And because it is recursive, np.convolve() and all other machinery is futile in this case, unfortunately.",True

@umutalihandikel5490,2017-03-29T20:16:37Z,1,"hey, thanks for videos!! I try to use this func for my analysis. But I think my results weights the initial values more, rather then the latest ones... The reason for the might be the format of my data source. Since Google takes the latest data in last row of csv, Yahoo takes the lates data in the first row. I see that your function is suitable for Yahoo. I use Google Fin as my data source. Thus I need to turn your function revers.. How do I do that? Any ideas? Please help! :)",True
@ruchikayadav7208,2016-12-07T14:11:48Z,0,can you plz tell something about weighted moving average,True

@Pharellka,2015-11-24T22:16:29Z,0,ema results are wrong,True
@hamjii,2014-05-04T15:07:19Z,0,"Hi, Harrison. I think kwak's suggestion below deserves your attention. I also find that your EMA always returns 15 emas however I change the windows, which can't be right !? kwak's version seems to be working fine though.",True
@kwakakak,2014-04-24T17:37:20Z,6,"I suggest def ema(v, k):     weights = exp(linspace(-1,0,k))     weights /= weights.sum()     return convolve(v, weights)[k-1:len(v)]",True
@kwakakak,2014-04-24T17:17:43Z,0,but your ema and sma have different lengths for the same arguments..,True
