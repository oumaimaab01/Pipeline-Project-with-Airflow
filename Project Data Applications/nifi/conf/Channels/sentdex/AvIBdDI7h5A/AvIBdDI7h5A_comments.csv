@lukemoon4466,2021-08-08T12:27:05Z,0,Is anyone else getting issues with the elements of the navbar bunching up to the left and not positioning properly when using the tutorial code? I've tried using example navbar code direct from the Bootstrap website which works better............but then there is issues with the dropdown menu not working properly (even though I have included the updated 'script' tags from the Bootstrap website). My next attempted fix will probably be mixing things up and using the script tags Harrison uses? Along with the Bootstrap example code.........direct from the source. If anyone had similar issues.......I would appreciate a reply...............thanks,True
@SolidBuildersInc,2021-01-15T22:49:46Z,0,Thanks for the series.  I had a ah-ha moment.   Curious if things have changed on how you would build a website since this series?  I see you are using bootstrap and that there is HTML5 now.  Do you have any other recommended tutorials that cover this type of workflow for Development?  thanks for any feedback,True

@tah6126,2016-07-16T08:14:00Z,0,"First of all thanks for the tutorial!! I'am having trouble with my modal view, I'am using a form validation to check if the users input matching the requirements, the problem is that when the validation fails the modal view disapears, next time the user opens the modal view the view shows the user what went wrong with the previous input. I know why this is happening, because I render the template after the user hits submit within the modal view, but I dont know how to prevent that the modal view disappears when the validation fails. Would be great to have your thoughts on this! Thanks alot in advanced",True
