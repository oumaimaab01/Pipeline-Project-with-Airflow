I need to open an executable, let it run and close the program after it finishes. I managed to do that using pywinauto and setting a timer. So, after X seconds, the program executed would close. However, it is far from efficient because some times it would take 20 seconds, some times it would take 200. I would like to remove that dead time. So, how can I make python know when the executable is finished so that it can kill the application? Thanks in advance (y)",True
