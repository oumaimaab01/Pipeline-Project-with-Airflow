As I'm watching I'm thinking 1 minute updating is way overkill for things I'm thinking about (I'm actually wanting to mix in fundamentals).  I'm wondering if there's a way for simulation to simply trade at end of day or open prices, or make order for next day.    I've worked with end of day data with amibroker and place order the next day, so it'd be nice to understand how to simplify process in quantopian similarly as I have no interest in 1 minute bars at this point, but it sounds like it's inherent in the handle_data method.  I'm just learning, so I'll have to read, but the 1m bar seems a bit much for any imaginable trades I'm considering.",True
