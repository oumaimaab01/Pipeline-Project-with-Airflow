I tried to do a little magic with this form but I'm missing something:  folderpath = os.path.join(main_folderpath + ""\\"" + class_folder + ""\\"" + section_folder + ""\\"" + section_part_folder) os.mkdir(folderpath)  I expected this set of folders to be made: C:\\Users\Public\Main Folder\Class-Title\Section-Title\Section-Part\  I got an error, though...Python telling me there was no such location, although an earlier mistake of leaving out the escaped backslashes successfully made an errant folder at: C:\\Users\Public\Main FolderClass-TitleSection-TitleSection-Part\  - - -  Does Python not create the folders in order...meaning, first mkdir makes a folder called 'Class-Title,' and then makes the next folder...or is the problem that you have to make the folders, one at a time, each a separate command?  Hopefully, that's not as jumbled as it is in my head.",True
