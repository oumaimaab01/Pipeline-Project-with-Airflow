@EranM,2018-05-13T14:32:13Z,1,"This is how you quickly investigate your results:  1) I would suggest to train until a certain point in time and test after that point. After all, this is a sequential data and not random observations.  I've tested the score and its looks like this:  clf.score: 0.703125 (need to read implementation to understand this score) AUC: 0.758748674443 Precision: 0.55   2) I would use an AUC metric to evaluate how good this model learns. 3) After using a precision (tp / (tp + fp)) and got such a low score of 0.55 I decided to print a confusion_matrix. 4) confusion_matrix results:      0    1 0 | 23 18 1 |  1   22  Which means i can predict 0 with precision of 95% and predict 1 with precision of 55%. So this model is REALLY GOOD for predicting FALLS, and close to RANDOM in predicting RISES.   Conclusion: Model is good to predict falls of HPI.  All in all, GREAT SERIES sentdex !!!",True

@alv2648,2017-05-01T18:55:30Z,0,It's the SVM using skewed data? So it's predicting label correct 80% of the time because drops are relatively rare? Is there a way to measure score for when label = 0? vs combined label? Great series thanks!!,True
@EvilSpeculator,2017-04-16T12:57:52Z,2,It literally took me weeks to write a sparse list parser in C# that was feeding into libSVM. Python does it in 20 minutes - awesome.,True
@lecioufs,2017-04-04T16:28:27Z,1,"Hi Harisson! One quick question:   How did you score it without predicting first?  Aren¬¥t we supposed to:  pred = clf.predict(X_test)               ,       and then: print (clf.score(y_test, pred))  ??",True

@johnhanlon1531,2016-11-15T03:51:13Z,0,"Wanted to try and confirm a couple of things:  Is the clf.score actually how accurate the model is? That is, if the score output is 0.80 does that mean the model has predicted 80% of the Label values correctly?  Also, because we drop the Label and the Fut Value, does that mean we are trying to predict the (nat'l) Fut HPI value based on each state's housing index, unemployment, GDP, and the S&P 500?",True

@theword6424,2016-07-28T05:35:51Z,1,+sentdex Just finished the whole 16 part tutorial but could this final one is the most confusing. In layman;s terms what did I just do? Could you break it down. I mean the results what is it all about. I thought the whole idea was to show the states where  it would be good to invest but all I see is just numbers. How do we interpret the results? Thanks in advance!,True

@ConnerDKnox,2015-11-09T03:05:10Z,0,"Hi Harrison!  Big fan of your videos, I hadn't had time to work through all the code on my own yet but was wondering what sort of accuracy you get if you simply always predict increases as the HPI has somewhat steadily increased over time?  As best I can tell the scoring is the percentage of predictions that the model correctly predicted, so might it even make sense to look at the models score as (% correct model prediction - % correct always increase prediction)/(1-% correct always increase prediction)? Thanks a ton for the work you put into these videos!",True
