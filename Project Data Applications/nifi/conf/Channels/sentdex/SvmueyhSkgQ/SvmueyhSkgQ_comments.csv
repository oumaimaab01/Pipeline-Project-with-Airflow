@joshuaronisjr,2018-06-06T10:33:17Z,0,"Hey sentdex. So I tried deriving the equation for a slope of best fit, but I got the wrong answer because instead of squaring all the residuals, I would simply take their absolute value. Why is it that we square the residuals? Wouldn't that make the line of best fit more susceptible to outliers? Why would we want that?

@jarrodhamilton4404,2016-11-02T00:56:06Z,0,To find m or the slope it might be easier to just use numpy and find the co-variance of the x and y then divide it by the variance of x.

@mamazu1995,2016-04-17T21:00:44Z,0,"I have a few things to comment actually. I have to admit that implementing this is not easy but the way you did is indeed quite confusing because your code is just basically a one-line return value tried to write nicely. 1. Why don't you avoid the confusion with the division and split this up into numerator and denominator and then returned numerator/denominator to make it clearer? If you do it like that you wouldn't need a single bracket (except for function calls) 2. Why don't you save the mean of x in a variable? You use it three times in your code. I don't know how smart the mean function is but with a bigger dataset, it would be probably be better to calculate it once and reuse it. 3. I know that this is not a real issue, but why do you name the parameters of the function the same as the variables you have in the global scope. I know that the parameters take precedence over the global variables but this encourages shadowing. Just as a side note.  But otherwise I like your style of programming and programming python make it look elegant.",True
