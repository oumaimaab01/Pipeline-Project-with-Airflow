I started out with just some random brush strokes I made in gimp and after that it went crazy. Also did this on some fractal flames I rendered with Jwildfire to make a cool animation. I can recommend you to take a look at PyTorch if you have not done that yet, for me that's way easier and less hassle than using TensorFlow both in code and understanding (which I also used).",True
