YES error checking and code efficiency are VERY important. But not important at all if you cant get anything to run in the first place lol . Just give me the bare bones basic way to ""Just make it work"". once I have that understanding , its much easier to start incorporating some of the more important aspects of programming in that language as you move on to bigger and more complex programs. Wish you were around 20 years ago when  I was first trying to wrap my head around pointers and memory management in c++.    By the way the game gets to be a little more fun once you strap a missile launcher to the hood of the car. Then the blocks need to dodge you lol",True

@Myrslokstok,2018-09-02T07:33:55Z,1,Very good that you did the simple stuff that is normaly in a game. You could expand with: 1) music 2) sound effect 3) animated car or block 4) highscore list  You could do like gasoline tank in car and that the car have to run over and collect gasolintanks to keep going.,True

Been trying to look up tutorials for this for a while, but always just gave up  because of how shitty the documention or tutorial was. You'd think that PyGame making would be at least common enough to have more decent tutorials and documentation. Glad you were the exception. Nice tutorial, gonna continue with the rest!",True
