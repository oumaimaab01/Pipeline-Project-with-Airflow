@kyleconn4679,2016-11-01T23:42:43Z,3,"I wanted to expand on some of your stock data analysis programs. Instead of working with CSV files I made a program that will download the CSV, create a database table and insert the data. Works great. However,  it is slow. I takes about 60secs to enter in the data for a single year of a given stock. Estimated  time to enter in all data for all stocks, 5000+ hours. :(  Been looking into threading the program, but it still seems like I would run into the GIL. I might have to find a new project to play around with. This was all just so I could work with a database file instead of CSV files. Hopefully this new intermediate series will give me some ideas.   Love the videos dude, I've been learning a lot. Thanks.  Edit: Had to come back and explain how much of a noob I am. After so further tests, while I was monitoring my computers performance i notice that working off my storage HDD and not my SSD. Boy to I feel the shame.... LOL. well at least I caught it.
