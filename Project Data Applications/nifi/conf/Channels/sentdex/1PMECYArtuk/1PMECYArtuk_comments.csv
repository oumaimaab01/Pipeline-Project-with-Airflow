@Veptis,2021-09-06T13:50:23Z,0,"it does parse docstrings as well, right? Perhaps it can not only generate functions from docstrings (especially with examples?) Perhaps the opposite.  It's really exciting to shift the conversation for computational linguistics to programming language as formal languages, because getting syntax right is already a hurdle.",True
@Guytron95,2021-08-11T19:16:50Z,0,I put generate(inp) in a loop to produce a variety of output at once but all I get is exactly identical output in each iteration. How does one jiggle the random seed?  Something in resp model object I suppose.,True
@the_god_killah,2021-08-11T03:39:41Z,0,You sound like John Hammond(another youtuber),True
@josebordon2707,2021-08-02T17:01:08Z,0,I'm curious if you can use this to convert R code to python. I feel like R has better statistical analysis packages. You might be able to train it by seeing if the new python code outputs what R outputs.,True
@festro1000,2021-08-02T11:05:05Z,1,"I hate the idea that companies take our data, sell it, then have the audacity to charge us for a product formed from said data. I was stoked when OpenAI first came out claiming that this boon to technological advancement should be open to all, not hidden in some walled garden for only billionaires to play with; Imagine my disappointment when they touted everything that GPT-3 could do and branded the model closed source, with the only people having free reign being billionaires.",True
@dr.mikeybee,2021-08-02T03:47:21Z,2,"This is really great.  I'm in the copilot beta, and it's nice to know that when they want to start sending me a bill, I'll have an option.",True
@dr.mikeybee,2021-08-02T00:30:33Z,0,"As far as I know, Copilot does not work inside VSCode's notebooks; so your model is one up on them there.",True
@dr.mikeybee,2021-08-02T00:24:19Z,0,I wonder if you can get large GPT3 performance if you train a lambda net?,True
@easytutorial1869,2021-07-27T02:35:43Z,0,What should I choose between B.tech Cse with specialization in ai/ml engineering and B.tech Cse with specialization in data science?,True
@oddzc,2021-07-26T21:36:42Z,0,I think it would be cool to be able to measure and limit complexity of the generated code. That would make these tools a heaps more useful “copilot”.,True
@godfather7339,2021-07-26T06:42:26Z,0,"so when is the GNU ""CoPilot"" coming out?",True
@scatmambo6999,2021-07-26T02:28:28Z,0,الفيديو جميل جدا شاهدته مع صديقي واستفدنا كثير اتغيرت حياتنا تماما بعد مشاهدته ، كما ارسلته لجميع اصدقائي فاعجبهم وانبسطوا وتغيرت حياتهم,True

@ScriptureFirst,2021-07-24T05:45:19Z,2,Remember GPT gives dif ans EVERY time you roll the exact same values. Don’t forget to spin the wheel a handful of times w the same prompt ;),True
@abhishekprajapat415,2021-07-24T01:58:43Z,2,"Ok, dude here is the thing. Your work is great and a lot of people have already told you that but I would really like to mention your CUPS. Man I have watched so many of your videos and you have so many different cups and every single one of them is sooooo unique that I want to have one for myself.",True

@fiNitEarth,2021-07-23T20:23:01Z,0,"Is there any chance you could teach the algorithm the context of the code's aim it's learning from? So that in a far future it would be able to code by itself after you tell him what you need? That would be some fancy stuff, even if it'd only worked for very easy tasks",True
@stevenclive8910,2021-07-23T18:51:05Z,1,Ahhh... Finally... Thank you sooooo much,True
