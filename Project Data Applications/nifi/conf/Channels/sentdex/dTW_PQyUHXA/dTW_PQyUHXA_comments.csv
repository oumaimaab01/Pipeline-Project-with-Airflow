@Fazal828,2019-04-16T21:56:34Z,0,"I'll be honest, I started watching this video in incognito mode because I didn't know if I wanted these kinds of videos in my feed. Having watched it, I honestly loved this video and would love to see more. In fact, I'm watching this again with my account logged in.  I specifically loved the narration. It helped put logic to the chaos and I got to see the mindset that racing requires. Honestly, one of the best things I have ever watched.",True

@ancientapparition1638,2019-04-16T20:14:37Z,0,Sick porsche man. I've been trying to get into ECU ROM tuning but unfortunately I'm not sure if the ignition/spark and fuel tables in the EEPROM onboard the ECU is at a standardized offset. Probably not. Would you happen to know? I'm not sure if your car has a bought ECU or a piggy back. Thanks,True

@chris-graham,2019-04-16T19:46:44Z,0,"""at a typical DE you can trust like 10%""  welcome to champcar racing ;)  5:58 - when you go to pass someone, try to squeeze as close to the car as possible. it compromises their corner entry and prevents them from overtaking you via. over/under. essentially you make them go so deep into the corner that thay're forced to turn sharper than you. also when they hit you (and eventually they will), a small tap from a few inches is much less damage than a large impact from a few feet.",True
