@bb4II3r,2019-01-08T12:39:43Z,0,"Hi, I'm following along this tutorial and will appreciate a problem I'm facing. Since our dataset contains images of different sizes (e.g. 48 by 48, 64 by 64), how do we set the input_shape? I tried sentdex's method of test_x[1:] but this only gave me a scalar.",True
@kobaltauge,2018-12-23T16:39:25Z,0,"Great video. You should try Visual Studio Code. No Problems to convert the intenstion from tabs to spaces an back. And you can additionally use regex [\t] in search an replace with ""    "".",True
@vasisthasinghal8896,2018-12-12T09:23:45Z,0,"Can you suggest an algorithm for finding correlation between sensors and alarms that they trigger?  I have data for sensors over a period of 3 months and the times at which specific alarms were triggered. I need to find a way to figure out which sensors or combination of sensors trigger which alarm. Btw, love your channel :) Huge fan !",True
@henningsperr8063,2018-12-11T13:41:52Z,0,"Couple of things I noticed:   - I reimplemented what you did so far and played a bit with it on my machine.  It seems at least my bot mostly learns that going one step from the dropoff and back to the dropoff is one of the best strategies (collecting just whats around the dropoff) I assume that many random games we see have this kind of pattern.  Training data creation: - I assume the files that make it into the >4400 halite categorie are mostly halite dense maps and at least my bot just runs in circles or doesn't move at all on maps with little halite around the dropoff - Sampling like we do it currently creates a lot more 4 player games with high halite amounts (in four player games we have 4 random bots and four times the chance to score > 4400 halite)  Would be cool if you could address those things, or probably you will anyway :)  Edit: @sentdex I went back and watched the videos that you copied the model from and it seems there is an activation layer missing after the dense layer. You fixed it in the p4 video but seems you did not update the tutorial!",True

@daviderrington2241,2018-12-06T12:05:50Z,1,"Hi, at the end you mention the need to move the generator inside the epoch loop to avoid empty training data in later epochs despite the fact that we should only have to load training data once. However we never reset LOAD_TRAIN_FILES so won't this slow the problem by having to reload the data every epoch?  Secondly, even though we chunk the data inside each epoch and create training_file_chunks, we don't appear to ever use these? A few lines later we have ""for f in tqdm(training_file_names)"". Shouldn't this be looping through the elements of training_file_chunks?  Lastly, can you elaborate on why you are using a sigmoid rather than a softmax?   Thank you",True

@avankooy,2018-12-05T21:38:18Z,0,"How does the 'fit' parameter 'epochs' differ from the EPOCHS variable we set. I see you are using epochs=1 in the fit function, is that saying for each batch we are only performing one pass through of the data? Then the outer loop would be how many times we are pushing all the data through the model?",True
@jeyemGFX,2018-12-05T18:55:56Z,0,Seeing how you create the Balancing function: Have you ever used Ctrl+D in Sublime? It would have saved you THAT often in just this tiny bit of code.,True

@donadigotm,2018-12-05T16:47:43Z,3,"Your last output activation function is wrong - if you want to optimize for categorical crossentropy you should use ""softmax"" instead of ""sigmoid"" so that you get a probability distribution of your choices. I would also suggest taking a look at the data that is fed to the model to make sure that it is alright. Anyway, enjoying the series so far :)",True

@Cleanblue1990,2018-12-05T12:01:38Z,3,"At 20:00 you could make a list like  ""_choices = [_0, _1, _2, _3, _4]""  and then in the for loop only one line  ""_choices[y].append(x,y)"".  ""shortest = min([len(choice) for choice in _choices])""",True
