@FRIENDSofCAP,2020-03-07T21:32:01Z,0,"QUESTION:  I am writing a program for my local Volunteer Fire Department for which I also serve on, and I use Google Maps API in python to get toownship, county, zip code and LAT/LON data.  I also want to obtain the UTM Zone and Easting / Northing data.  THis is called UTM coordinates.  Do you know how I can obtain this data by feeding some sort of function the LAT, LON data and get in return the values for Zone, UTM-Easting and UTM-Northing???  Thanks... TIm Curtin",True
@weatherwiz555,2019-08-20T18:24:19Z,1,"Hello, I've been watching a few of your videos the last few days as I am learning Python (in the beginning stages) and I must say, you're videos are incredible! Following your videos, I was able to generate a U.S. map with coordinates on it!     There was one issue (for me though)...I was plotting over 120 different coordinates so I incorporated all those into the code one-by-one...obviously very time consuming.    I apologize if there is a video on this and I just haven't found it, but is there an easy way to import an excel file (which has the latitude/longitude coordinates in it) and plot the coordinates using only a few lines of code as opposed to like 120+?",True

@bokkenka,2017-01-08T00:04:11Z,4,"Geographic coordinates are written lat-lon in the old sailing days.  They could measure their latitude using the North Star, so knew that to a high degree of accuracy, but once they were out to sea, they would only be guessing at their longitude.  Sometimes, they only recorded latitude.  Once Harrison invented his Sea Watch in the mid-18th Century, they were able to measure their longitude accurately by comparing the difference in time between noon at Greenwich England (0Â° Longitude) which was kept on the chronometer and when the Sun reached its highest point in the sky at local noon.  Every hour different was fifteen degrees.",True
