@doug.maximo,2019-02-08T09:22:58Z,0,Wouldn't it be better to use glScalef instead of glTranslate to zoom in and zoom out?,True
@nictanghe98,2018-07-15T22:31:48Z,1,"Oh i ws dissapointed on the whole zoom thing. That wasent actualy a zoom that is moving the cube along the Y axis  I whould realy like to know how to actually zoom as normaly up and down moves you along that axis.  (zoom is a camera movement not an object movement)  After a quick google i found that you can do an actual zoom with glViewport (offset_X, offset_Y, screen_X, screen_Y)",True

Thats weired. Only some keys on my Keyboard work. I cannot bind events to the number keys. They will not work. I feel like i am doing something wrong, but why would it then work with all buttons that haveÂ characters on them?  (EDIT) Does not work with your sample code either. There is something wrong with my computer...",True
