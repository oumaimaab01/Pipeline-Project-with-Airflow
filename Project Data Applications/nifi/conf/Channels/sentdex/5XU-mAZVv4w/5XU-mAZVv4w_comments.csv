Simply decode output (as ascii, or utf-8 which ascii is a subset of). ex: output = b'Hello\r\n' print(output) # gives b'hello\r\n' in 3.x, the expected 'hello'+newline in 2.x print(output.decode('ascii')) # gives the desired 'hello'+newline in 3.x and 2.x print(output.decode('utf-8')) # also gives the desired 'hello'+newline in 3.x and 2.x  @11:30 you mention you think 'r is for return and n for newline'. Actually 'r' is for carriage return (so, close) and 'n' is for 'line feed', which are old terms carried over from typewriters, a 'carriage return' would return the carriage (the part that held and moved the paper as you typed) back to the beginning of the line and a 'line feed' would advance ('feed') the paper one 'line' down.
