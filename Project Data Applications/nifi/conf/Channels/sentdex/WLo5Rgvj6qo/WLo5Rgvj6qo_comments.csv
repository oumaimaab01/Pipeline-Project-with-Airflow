@lawsonvest3684,2021-10-04T06:03:59Z,0,"Excellent tutorial; I really appreciate the depth! I'm experiencing a small hiccup and wonder if anyone here could help. When I ran the program the first time (the light was initially on), it stayed on, then turned off 5 seconds later, as I expected. However, I can no longer get the light to come back on. Could anyone here help? I'm suspicious that the problem may be with my raspberry pi, but I hope there's a simpler solution. Here's what I've tried:  Running code with a delay before turning the light on, and not turning it off again Testing the LED in another circuit to see if it works (it does) Switching the GPIO slot (and the code to account for the change) Checking the wire connections  After the five seconds elapse, the LED will flash very dimly very briefly, and I'm confident that I put the ""HIGH"" line before the time.sleep(5)",True

@InobuZ,2020-02-17T09:57:16Z,4,Best way to differentiate GPIO.BCM from GPIO.BOARD is to use two different nomenclature.   GPIO.BCM uses GPIO Number.  GPIO.Board uses RPi Pin Number.   The example uses GPIO.BCM which is GPIO 18.  If the GPIO.setmode is GPIO.BOARD  then Pin 12 would represent GPIO18.  Setmode tells python which way to look at the GPIO's.,True

@halonothing1,2018-08-21T14:46:01Z,2,"1k is way too high for the 3.3v of the gpio pins. Would only provide 1.3ma for a red LED or 300ua for a white LED. Which would certainly still light it up. Just not very brightly. Normally LEDs use up to 20ma. But with a Pi I get that you don't want to use too much current and strain the power supply. Especially if you're not using a 5.1v 2.5a supply as is recommended or if you're driving multiple LEDs. But I normally use 1k current limiting resistors on LEDs on a 12v power source. You could probably get away with using a 220 or 100 ohm resistor for a max of 13ma from the 100 ohm on a red LED. But 330 or 470 would be fine too. Or if current draw is limited, you could always drive a MOSFET from the GPIO and drive the LED with that on a separate power source, like a 9v battery. As a buffer. Or an op amp voltage follower if you really want to get fancy, but that's probably not necessary. Cheers!",True
