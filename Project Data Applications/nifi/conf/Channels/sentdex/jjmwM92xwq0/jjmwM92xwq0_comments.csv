@coolervik1994,2018-09-22T08:56:29Z,2,"Hey Sentdex, I love your tutorials and the way you code but I think the way you are balancing the dataset is not the right way to do it. If there's 90% no buys and 10% buys then by your method, you are removing 80% data from the nobuy class. So you are basically losing significant data which can be used to train the model. So, balancing using SMOTE method is way better since it upsamples the class with less data and sklearn has SMOTE function :)",True

But I personally think games have been made to lose against humans at some level. But it doesn't necessarily apply to forex market. Forex has not been made this way.  I just don't wanna waste my time concentrating on this and then realizing it wasn't practical as I thought it was gonna be!

Do you think it might be possible for you to include a short discussion (maybe later on in the series) on how we might be able to modify the code to include, say, additional alternative features?

There seems to be an almost infinite number of possibilities one might try when trying to design a Neural Net.
