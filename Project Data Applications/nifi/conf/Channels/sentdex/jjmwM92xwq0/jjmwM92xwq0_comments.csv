@coolervik1994,2018-09-22T08:56:29Z,2,"Hey Sentdex, I love your tutorials and the way you code but I think the way you are balancing the dataset is not the right way to do it. If there's 90% no buys and 10% buys then by your method, you are removing 80% data from the nobuy class. So you are basically losing significant data which can be used to train the model. So, balancing using SMOTE method is way better since it upsamples the class with less data and sklearn has SMOTE function :)",True

(Or did ya ?! :D ) I see everywhere that DL or RL has beaten this game or that game and everybody is like wow! imagine using this method to beat forex! But I personally think games have been made to lose against humans at some level. But it doesn't necessarily apply to forex market. Forex has not been made this way.  I just don't wanna waste my time concentrating on this and then realizing it wasn't practical as I thought it was gonna be!

Do you think it might be possible for you to include a short discussion (maybe later on in the series) on how we might be able to modify the code to include, say, additional alternative features?  Also, is there any sort of ‘best path’ in terms of choosing model parameters such as number of layers, nodes per layer, activation function, etc?  There seems to be an almost infinite number of possibilities one might try when trying to design a Neural Net.  Finally, I’m curious why you chose to go with such a small amount of training data (relatively speaking) since you’ve always emphasized how important it is to have as much training data as possible and there certainly is no shortage of cyber$ tick data.
