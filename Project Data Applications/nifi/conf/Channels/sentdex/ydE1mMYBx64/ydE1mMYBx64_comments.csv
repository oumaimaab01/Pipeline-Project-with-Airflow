@wouterdroog4210,2014-12-25T13:23:36Z,4,"As can been seen in this video there is a small bug in the code. In the changeSampleSize function you need to assign the input variable size to resamplesize before the if statement. Otherwise the first time you change the time frame and then the resamplesize, the resamplesize won't update and hence the popupmsg won't display.  This is the correct implemantation of the changeSampleSize function: def changeSampleSize(size, width):     global resampleSize, datCounter, candleWidth     resampleSize = size         if dataPace ==""7d"" and resampleSize == ""1Min"":         popupmsg(""Too much data chosen, choose a smaller time frame or higher OHLC interval"")       elif dataPace == ""tick"":         popupmsg(""You are currently viewing tick data not OHLC."")     else:         datCounter = 9000         candleWidth = width",True
