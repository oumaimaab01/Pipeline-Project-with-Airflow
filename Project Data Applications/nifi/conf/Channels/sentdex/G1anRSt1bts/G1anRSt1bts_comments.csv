For example if you specify an enemy to attack it won't necessarily attack the closest one and might walk through a bunch of attacking fire.  If you do a location attack then it will attack what's closest.

I can say ""elif known_enemy_structures part looks unnecessery since it says in the comment lines that known_enemy_units also returns enemy structures if it exists.This also makes so your stalkers may chose to attack enemy structures while that one enemy unit(soldier, what ever it's called in this game) is rocking your workers in your base.

@ninjalacoon,2018-06-26T08:36:21Z,0,"One other suggestion I can make to further improve the power of the sentebot ai, especially where protoss units are considered, is the idea of recycling your units during a fight. You would need to add some logic to micromanage your combat units so that during an engagement weakened units move to the back of your army and recharge their shields while still shooting and allow for your other full health/shield units to take some of the heat. You can probably imagine that this allows you to give your fighting force a lot more longevity and eek out even more value from them without spending more resources or waiting for more units to be mustered.",True

@azthecx,2018-06-26T00:25:59Z,6,"In StarCraft macro is ridiculously overpowered, that's why you're having such an easy time vs AI because your macro can easily keep your resources very low. Even with your current logic if you just kept adding Gateways and massing stalkers you would likely have won versus hard.  Macro is macro-management, how well you spend your money, upgrade your units, build more buildings.  Also since you seem to have infinite APM (Actions per Minute) you likely can get the Blink upgrade for the stalkers and just faceroll most AI's by blinking your weak Stalkers to the back.

I just limited the workers in 60 and changed a few other things and was able to win like 70% on mode hard, because if you lose the first batch of Stalkers you send, then one at a time makes it impossible to win, so I`m holding the new ones after the first group dies and then send them again.. I would like to know if it would be possible to implement this technique on Age of Empires or is it just possible with ML?

@TheMcal9909,2018-06-25T20:41:02Z,2,Limiting the population of workers by using the ideal amount of harvesters for each of your harvesting buildings. Assimilators is 3 and Nexus is 16(when surrounded by minerals). You can get this using the API.  .ideal_harvesters can be used on each Nexus and Assimilator and just set your worker limit to the sum of this.  I have used .ideal_harvesters to stop building Assimilators near a Nexus that doesnt have its ideal amount harvesting minerals.. I found i had to much gas later game and compared to minerals. Speeds up the early game a little aswell.,True

Also (and here I'm not certain) I think that by passing '.position' to the attack method you are ordering an ""attack move"" of the location instead of direct attack of specific unit - so your unit will attack anything it encounters on the way instead of chasing that one specific unit.
