@ChupachuGames,2018-09-21T03:54:57Z,0,"Probes can 'touch and go' to build stuff (like Undead in WC3), so when they sit at the building assimilator and don't get redistributed, it means they're trying to build an assimilator every frame.

@Y-anon,2018-06-24T10:30:09Z,0,"For those of you wanting to learn a bit about the game,  yesterday the grand final of the GSL took place (Global Starcraft2 League, basically the biggest Korean Tournament for SC2), here's a link to the game https://youtu.be/a0IijqePUsA?t=1777 (timestamp = start of the first game)  Can you build an AI that would go toe to toe with those guys ? :p  Also try to take note of what triggers what reaction by each players, and what they're doing to gain an edge. Think of it in terms of trades, trading units for enemy workers to slow the opponent's economy, and army vs army so that in the next big engagement you've carved enough of an edge to get the win, it's a mix of ""death by a thousands cuts"" and ""shoving your feet through the opponent's throat"". It can get quite complex but it can be appreciated even if you know nothing about the game, a lot more could be said about the game, but just enjoy it really, curiosity will come naturally if you dig the game :p  It goes very well with beer and pizza btw :)  edit: I should have watched the games first... xD extra: https://youtu.be/76cmNNTZz1A?t=839",True
@EmberQuill,2018-06-24T01:27:13Z,0,"Pretty cool so far. Based on the first 2 tutorials I wrote a ""Zerg Rush"" bot that basically just spawns Zerglings (the lowest-tier combat unit for the Zerg race) and sends them at the enemy in waves. Works surprisingly well against Easy difficulty AI, but fails hard against any higher difficulties.  Now I just have to figure out how to pick locations for pylons instead of just building them all right next to each base...",True

@cruso2711,2018-06-23T23:41:43Z,1,Just a great video and idea for a series! I enjoyed your GTA 5 self driving car one and I am looking forward to this. I really hope you will be able to find some application for a neural network again. The provided large dataset of recorded games (https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#replay-packs) might make this task a lot less tedious than in the GTA 5 series. Also if you do it could be interesting to look closer into single decisions of the neural net.,True

@MetsuryuVids,2018-06-23T17:33:40Z,4,"Hey, about the bug where a probe is queued up in the nexus, when it shouldn't, could it be because of the build_workers method being async, so that it runs again before the probe starts building, so it queues another one?

@toastrecon,2018-06-23T13:37:52Z,2,"I wonder if it would be beneficial to add some ""dimensions"" to the AI that might not readily emerge from deep learning? Like having a strategy ""AI"" to explore and find weaknesses or opportunities, a tactics AI that would learn how to manage and move units, a supply AI to manage the resources, and respond to requests for units from the tactics AI? It might be ""cheating"" the process, but it seems like seeding it would be helpful, kind of like the brain isn't just a bunch of neurons without region or specialty.",True
