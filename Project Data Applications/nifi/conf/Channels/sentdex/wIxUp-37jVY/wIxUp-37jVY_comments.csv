@TheDeadking100,2021-03-15T09:19:00Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, I love this series. I have one question - How comes you did divide your image data values by 255, so that they fit between 0 and 1? I thought this was important for the model to work with the data better? Was this step left out intentionally?",True

@tuhinmukherjee8141,2021-02-09T10:01:49Z,0,"Maybe one shouldn't break the temporal/linear consistency of the data. Rather, pack the data into tuples of size 2 or 3 depending on your choice of threshold following the Markov property. Rather than shuffling the entire thing, one should shuffle those tuples rather. For eg:  1. Break the list into tuples of size, let's say 3 : new_data = zip(data[::3], data[1::3], data[2::3]) 2. Shuffle the new data instead shuffle(new_data) I might be wrong but maybe this could be a better input to feed to a neural network rather than a single frame at a time.",True

@dennischeung3745,2017-09-19T10:42:10Z,1,"Can anyone explain more about the purpose of balancing the data?

@theknight2510,2017-06-21T15:26:08Z,2,"I'm thinking that pre-allocating the memory for lefts, rights and forwards would be a lot faster. I was looking at this as inspiration for my own data (3-second audio files). I have about 700,000 of them, and pre-allocating memory helped make it blazingly fast. I was also using numpy arrays instead of lists though.  P.S. Still my favourite youtube channel. Sorry, Siraj.",True

@xR0G3R,2017-05-21T19:02:20Z,0,"You could mirror your 'right' and 'left' part of the dataset, right? That way you should be able to augment the number of the not-forward data.  Let me know if this does not work.  btw, great tutorials  :}",True
@uobscdarkside732,2017-05-05T01:18:09Z,2,"silly question, but wouldnt setting the lengths of lefts rights and forwards equal just make each one equal probability,  as if you'd pressed them an equal amount of times thus making it pointless having done the training??? what am i missing / not understanding?",True

@WoodyWilliams,2017-04-24T18:41:29Z,1,"Freeze-framing at 12:34 the math of your balance slices doesn't add up. Does it matter?

Taking the smallest (lefts) and trimming the others to its len() should create 3x6427 = 19281 < 22436. Also 22436 % 3 != 0. Our final_data isn't really balanced??  What's causing this?",True
