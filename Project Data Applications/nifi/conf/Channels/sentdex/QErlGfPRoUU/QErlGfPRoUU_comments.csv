@Indemere,2018-11-10T09:19:15Z,7,"Small mistake though, win doesn’t actually use the current_game that it’s being passed. Rather it uses the “global” game board. This could cause issues later down the road. Love the content! Cheers!",True

@ChettahZpeed,2018-11-09T04:43:45Z,1,"One way you could do the presentation is using the numbers 1-9     1  |  2  |  3 --------------------   4  |  5  |  6 --------------------   7  |  8  |  9   and to input you could use something like: def place_at(pos, to_place):     pos -= 1     positions[pos//3][pos%3] = to_place   where 'pos' is the number you want to place 'x' or 'o'. to_place is 'x' or 'o'   Only problem is that it isn't dynamic, but it can definitely won't be that hard, just change the number you divide.",True

@ShirshKhandeliaSKJ,2018-11-08T23:40:49Z,3,"EDIT 2: It's Done! Finally, I got off whatever I was stuck in and completed the code. Although, check this out: https://kainatic.github.io/Sentdex-Projects/ It also has the code.  EDIT: I'll upload corrected code soon.  @sentdex Ok, so some things I want to clear out. When I was modifying the code, I noticed many things. This code still has many hard-coded statements which prevent it from going full-out dynamic. Also, there's a print(row) statement in Horizontal win check which prints the game map again. And, the code doesn't have a tie check. Please re-check and IF you have the time to edit the next/last video, correct the code.",True
