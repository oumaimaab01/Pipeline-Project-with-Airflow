@mattizzle81,2019-12-13T05:50:37Z,0,"I bought two of these, a Google Edge TPU and a PI 4.   Honestly they are just collecting dust. I suppose it is my personal preferences but I find developing ML on smartphones much more interesting and useful.  Sure, my high end smartphone capable of 30fps object detection does not cost $99, but it has everything in it, screen, battery, more powerful, etc. It is what I have with me at all times, and I can build an app for the masses if I want to.  I found these a waste of money. Maybe if I was into robotics etc it would be different",True
