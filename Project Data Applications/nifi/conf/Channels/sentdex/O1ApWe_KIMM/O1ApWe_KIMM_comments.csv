@reinerheiner1148,2013-11-09T15:47:22Z,1,"Awesome video, as always. Now only two things are missing for charting in your series:  chart scrolling while the chart adjusts to the window height like in charting applications,  and interactivity (like adding a trend line to a chart). Which might actually come in handy if you want to train an AI spotting a chart pattern by first providing examples to it, later on only correct it until it performs well. This is kinda how they do it to train an car driving / assisting AI for example.  Would be mind blowing if you could post tutorials on those two too.",True
