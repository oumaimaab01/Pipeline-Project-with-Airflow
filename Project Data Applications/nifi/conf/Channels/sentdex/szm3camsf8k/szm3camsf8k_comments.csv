@omkardumbre3421,2022-02-02T11:58:15Z,0,Can anyone let me know that.. I have one problem...my boss told me to find the com ports which are accessible an inaccessible so can we use socket for serial com port scanning?,True
@rafy-ivanmorales3077,2021-12-04T01:51:04Z,0,"I want to ask for help....I need to make a program  with Python program that should test the given host and it should generate a list of  all the TCP Open ports within the range of 1 to 1025. You are required to accomplish this task by using  standard Python’s “socket” library. Following are the functional requirements:  1. On execution of program system should prompt “Enter a host to scan”. User will provide a host  name  2. System should look for all the ports between the range of 1 to 1025  3. If the Ports is open it should create a file and add an entry for port number  4. In case of any exception for instance “host is not available”, “host name could not be resolved” or  due to any other error you need to write that exception into same file  5. You also need to record starting and ending date and time at the beginning and ending of file  accordingly. It should also show the total time it took in port scanning process",True
