@NareshGanatra,2016-12-12T19:57:05Z,0,"As always, Excellent video ! A quick question on this please. I used kmeans to do flat clustering on text documents and then using the kmeans  predicting which cluster newly arrived documents are falling in. It is working great, here is something I am trying to figure out though...after prediction how can I find out the confidence level ? Or in other words how far a new sample of text data is from its nearest centroid. Do I find out Silhouette Coefficient for a particular sample or is it something else and how does one do so please ? Thanks Again !",True

@uniqueraj518,2015-09-14T09:05:06Z,0,"Nice video, if you want to use your own dataset, X being feature matrix,(imported as csv file) why we can not cluster without using PCA? i would be really happy for your response.  in scikit learn , is PCA is compulsary before KMeans clustering",True

@Moment_Captured,2015-06-11T16:33:12Z,0,"Interesting video.  So I wanted to know if you could substitute HOG features for X and create a KMeans Plot for a collection of Images.  I have successfully run the SVM for these data but wanted to see how the data was distributed.  I tried a simple case of two sets of images.  The code ran but there is something I don't understand about the feature array from HOG images.  The KMeans fit seems to have labeled the data as 0,1 but instead of getting an x,y like you have the feature array has coordinate: [  0.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00 ...,   3.42854831e-16    1.10856395e-15   5.82853213e-16] label: 1 for example.  Perhaps if I take the log??? Do you know anything about how the HOG feature array is set up so I can get a meaningful KMeans plot?",True
