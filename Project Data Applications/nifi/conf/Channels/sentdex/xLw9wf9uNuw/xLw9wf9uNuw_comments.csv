@LrdKGB,2020-01-22T17:33:30Z,0,"Hi, I am pulling data from an API and trying to animate a live graph like in video 16 of your tutorial. So I am getting the data within the animate function then save the results in a dictionary that I then plot just like in the tutorial. However it only generate a graph once without animating it, thus refreshing it with the data from the API. I'm trying to make a depth chart by using a stack plot chart and rounding up the book to make it look good. Any ideas on how I can make this work? Thanks a lot for your work, it is really appreciated.",True

@kamilziemian995,2018-02-15T13:01:10Z,0,"This is bad way of using arrowprops arrowprops=dict(facecolor='red', color='grey') because facecolor is first set to read and after that color of all parts of arrow, facecolor included, is set to 'grey'.
