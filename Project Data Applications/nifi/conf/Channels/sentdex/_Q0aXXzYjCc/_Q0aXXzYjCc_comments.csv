@jd5787,2015-09-02T21:15:33Z,0,"Hi, awesome tutorial as usual :) quick question : how would you implement a live streaming system ""a-la"" twitter where once a user has submitted something and it is written in the DB, other users' browsers would be updated automatically? A server side system seems to be better as a client side would induce a lot of polling. Thanks!",True

@desoltvids,2015-04-02T21:17:32Z,0,"Awesome video sentdex, I've watched everyone so far but there's something I don't understand.  When you log in users via cookies, you never actually store a password, all you do is store their username and if they're logged in.  In theory, couldn't one just use the javascript console, change the cookies ""logged_in"" and ""username"" to the user they wish to pretend to be, and go about there way?  I'm sure you're going to talk about this later on, I was just curious. I'm still trying to learn more on back-end web development, and your tutorials have been awesome, you explain it in a way that makes sense.  Thanks.",True
