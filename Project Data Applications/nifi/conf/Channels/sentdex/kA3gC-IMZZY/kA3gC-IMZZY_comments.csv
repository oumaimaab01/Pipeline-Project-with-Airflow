@HardBroiled,2018-01-21T22:57:17Z,0,"Anyone else having issues with the following call?  history = model.fit(x_train, y_train,                     batch_size=batch_size,                     epochs=epochs,                     verbose=1,                     validation_split=0.1)  I'm getting an error from the validation_split line.  The error stack is going through different functions in the keras library that eventually terminates with:  File ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python36_64\lib\site-packages\keras\engine\training.py"", line 70, in <listcomp>     data = [np.expand_dims(x, 1) if x is not None and x.ndim == 1 else x for x in data] AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'ndim'  I've tried looking it up and it seems that errors like this aren't uncommon and they usually have something to do with preprocessing. Thus far I'm pretty much word for word following the tutorial so I doubt this is the case. I've tried adding some lines right before the model.fit call to make the x_train and y_train arrays into np.arrays based off googling the issue but I'm still getting the same error.  Anyone have any luck with something like this?",True

@zakcodes3507,2018-01-11T15:27:33Z,0,The reason why tensorflow can't just load a model is because it only saves the weights and doesn't save the structure. Essentially in your weight file you only got one big list of doubles. I do agree that it is cool to be able to load the model without defining it but in most applications you're either creating a new model or loading it so you have to know the structure of your model so you shouldn't have to save the structure.,True
