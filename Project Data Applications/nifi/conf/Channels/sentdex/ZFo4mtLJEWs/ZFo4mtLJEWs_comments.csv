@zperk13,2019-02-04T03:15:51Z,0,"black is still the absence of color, even with paint. Color is light hitting an object, absorbing some of that light, and reflecting some of it. The Sun emits light, it comes down to earth, hits a stop sign, and the red paint absorbs alot of the color, but reflects alot of red. If the light hits something black, the black thing absorbs alot of the color. It doesn't absorb all of it, otherwise you would have no depth perception on it, but still a lot. So 0,  0, 0 is saying we're reflecting 0% of the blue red and green light. Although monitors are emitting light, so instead of saying ""it's adsorbing all the light"" it would be like saying ""it's reflecting no light"" or in this case ""it's emitting no light"". The pixel just turns off. Whereas with white, it turns on the red, green, and blue subpixels to max, which when out eyes sees red, green and blue so close together in one spot, out brain says ""that's white"".",True
@cliffmathew,2019-02-03T20:55:30Z,0,"About RGB values: Imagine each tiny dot on the screen to be a set of 3 small light bulbs: one Red, one Green and the other Blue. When all 3 are OFF, all light is absent, and the point is Black. The 0,0,0 is telling the computer to turn off  all 3 lights, one zero per light, 0 indicating the off position of an imaginary dial. If you tell the computer to light all lights at full intensity, then it will show White light, combining Red, Green and Blue (assuming you look from a certain distance where you can't see each bulb separately, and they all blur into a single point).  When you dial down all 3 switches to  0,0,0, all are off, and you see Black. When you dial each switch up to its full value,  255,255,255, all 3 are at its full intensity, and hence you see  White. If you adjust those numbers individually, you control the intensity of each bulb,  giving you different colors. Hope it helps some readers.",True

@100sourav100,2018-03-25T02:24:27Z,0,"I love your tutorials.   Just a little physics behind colors:  * Black is the absence of all light - like in empty space.  * White is the presence of all light - like in a supernova explosion or something.  * Black paint/surface is made up of material that absorbs ALL light falling on it.  * White paint/surface is made up of material that reflects ALL light that falls on it.  * Red paint/surface is made up of material that reflects most light that falls on it except the light with red wavelength. It reflects back red ""light"" and hence appears red. Similarly for Blue, Green and the whole VIBGYOR spectrum.   * So, when you mix all colors of paint - the mixture tends to absorb all spectrum and reflect none, thereby appearing black.  * But, when you mix all colors of light - the mixture combines to give white which, by definition, contains the whole spectrum.   Difference here is between light that is ""reflected"" from a surface and as opposed to light rays ""emitted"" from a super hot body like the sun.   Except for grey ... I have no idea what happens there!!",True

@mage1over137,2017-03-07T18:31:49Z,1,"You shouldn't use white for transparent, because there is a very good chance you'll use white in  your sprites. Usually an ugly pink is used (rgb(244, 66, 235) works well). For simple sprite it's not a big deal, because you only need to use a color not used in the sprite, but if you doing a very complicated sprite sheet, there is a good chance white is used, but choosing a weird color probably not. It should also be noted if you using rgb color mode and not argb color mode, then for transparency  works by ignoring a single color is rgb value isfor every sprite, so choosing an ugly color, and not using that color for any part of your game you can maintain compatibility between the two modes, which is something you might want to do.   The reason that rgb mode has to ignore a color in order to have a transparent layer comes down to the fact that there just isn't room on a 24bit value(8 bits per color) for transparent to be encoded without sacrificing another color. You might wonder why pink is used and not say almost black(1,0,0) or black (0,0,0). These colors are basically the same, and you can choose to use only of the, but the ugly pink is probably going to be father removed from any color you decide to use and therefor offer nice contrast background. Or another way to think about it, why throw away a black I can use for a gradient effect, when I can throw away a pink in the middle of some other ugly pinks that probably won't every be used.",True

@MrSquishedsquashed,2015-01-04T16:42:25Z,8,I believe the reason the flip function exists is because the update function will check for parameters to establish whether it has to update specific elements before updating the whole surface. Meanwhile flip will just update everything with no checks involved which is probably handy when bit saving.  It's just a guess!,True
