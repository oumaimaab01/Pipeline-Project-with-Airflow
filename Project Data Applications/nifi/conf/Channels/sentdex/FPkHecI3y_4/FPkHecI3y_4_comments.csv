@nickt423,2019-01-22T17:07:36Z,0,I've been following this whole tutorial.  Along the way I have done some things slightly different (like using Panda to retrieve yahoo API).  Now when I try to annotate it is giving me this error: ValueError: Cannot add integral value to Timestamp without freq.  Why is it doing this? What needs to be done? I would appreciate it if someone could help me with this. Here is the code: https://www.codepile.net/pile/elJRralV,True
