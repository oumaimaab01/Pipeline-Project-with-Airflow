@gstexpla63,2017-10-21T19:20:16Z,0,"Hi! So the funda is that the window you want to send the keys to ('w' in this case) should be in 'focus' at the time the keys are being 'sent' to it. Windows will just send the keys to whatever window happens to be in focus at the time of code execution. Since the window in your code that is in focus is the IDLE window, the keys are not being sent to the GTA window. A shabby workaround I found in my intern was this: 1. Using pyAutoGUI use the mouse to 'click' the window you want to send the keys to 2. now send the actual keys I suppose you can figure out the mouse click part. This worked for me, I suppose the 'Alt+Tab' combo could also be sent through the code for such a task.",True
