@Moorooten,2021-04-20T06:54:18Z,1,"I really like your stuf but this time I just want to scream at you ""of course your input_generator does not yield anything if no key is being pressed"", no frames are getting added becauese the generator is waiting for input. Keep spamming a key and you will get a recording but I guess you realized that by now.  You are trying to do parallell work here so your solution could be to use threads (maybe a bit ugly) otherwise i would look into if curtsies, curses (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) or possibly termios has a non-blocking input call",True

@AminA-2051,2021-04-19T16:37:29Z,0,"I did something similar to you, but I believe the problem that arises when using Input from curtsies is that it requires a for loop that keeps querying for text input in real time. Since you also need the recording to be saved to frames in real time, you are going to have a bit of trouble using both pyaudio and curtsies. I don't know if that makes total sense, but that's my take on it. I slightly altered your code to just use a keypress notification (keyboard.is_pressed) that, on keypress, lets you run whatever code you want when you want to start and stop the recording. I'm attaching my code below if you wanted to take a look at it:  https://gist.github.com/Aminsteir/a69b06ea297400ef1341247e9c79b490",True

@NetflixWithQuickies,2021-04-19T16:00:40Z,1,"@sentdex You are trying to run two loops in parallel i.e. trying to get keyboard input and record audio, so you can probably use threading to do things in parallel.. Hope this helps.",True

@Indemere,2021-04-19T14:57:58Z,10,"Hi Sentdex, so the key detection “for e in...” doesn’t iterate until you press a key. It is stuck on a yield that awaits a key press. Basically, it wont enter the for loop until some key is pressed and then loops once before waiting again for the next key. That’s why it’s not writing chunks. You might have to use a separate thread that constantly reads the keyboard and updates some variable that you read every time in your while loop that writes the audio to disk.  While true: if done_record_pressed: break Else: Data=... Frames.append(data)  I recommend Pynput for easy keyboard monitoring using threads. They have great documentation and examples. Feel free to ask me any question if you run into problems.",True
