StackOverflow suggested install from the anaconda branch (v0.9), because the conda-forge branch was still v.81. I instead installed via github v0.10.0 ( https://github.com/pydata/pandas-datareader ).  Doing so produced a new (solved) error ""NotImplementedError: data_source='google' is not implemented""  In the `pandas-datareader`, they instead suggest to use the Stooq api.  Thus change the web.DataReader call to   df = web.DataReader('TSLA', 'stooq', start, end)  Made the process complete and work smoothly.",True
