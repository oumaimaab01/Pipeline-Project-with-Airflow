@LabGecko,2018-11-26T11:53:55Z,0,"Great video series! I think this could help get a more intuitive feel for how machine learning works. The only problem I'm having is that you seem to tell us what you're going to do a lot. Brief overviews are fine now and then, but I'd rather just see you do it, and explain it as you do it. Also, I'm taking back my previous vote on a different video when you asked if we'd like copy-paste + explain, or to see you debug. If it's basic syntax, then of course I'd rather copy+paste, but if it's an error that is logic or missing a header, etc., I think it's helpful to see you go through the process of fixing that. I watch videos to learn from other people's mistakes too. Thanks again for doing all these series! You got me going on Python in 2 days. That's impressive!",True

@ProjectSuperSport,2018-07-17T16:56:02Z,0,"Hey sentdex, love this series! A quick question - don't you think that giving the ""do nothing"" choice of action a consistent time period, would benefit the algrothim? Both in training and prefromance, I think that a more predictable action lets the bot a much better chance of learning to use it right. Ideally I would set it to be just a second or two, not to get stuck at it for too long.",True

@sibyjoseplathottam4828,2018-07-16T05:11:16Z,0,Glad to know that the model works. I finally managed to read (which you provided) and feed the data  into the Keras model using the tf dataset API and started training on my laptop. I will share my code if anybody is interested. Also another thing I noticed was that you don't seem to normalizing the xdata (image) by dividing it by 255 before feeding it to the CNN (unless I missed this part). Wouldn't this negatively affect the training?  A few things which I noticed could be improved: 1) The x data (image) is being stored as an uint8 datatype. But the y data  (one hot array) is being stored as float64 datatype. I think changing it to Bool datatype could reduce size of the .npy files. 2) The logic for issuing order to create buildings and units could me made into a general method. It could take as argument the type of building/unit to be created and it's per-requisites.,True
@bobsmithy3103,2018-07-16T03:46:27Z,0,"Is it possible to give the neural network full control of everything - like the what and when to load troops, how to command troops, when and which buildings to make and other similar commands? I'm kinda new to neural networks so I don't know if this is a weird question or not, but I thought it to be the best course of action as it would result in the NN having more control and therefore allowing it perform better right?",True

@roar779,2018-07-15T19:06:25Z,0,Thanks for the awesome tuts. I'd love to see your AI do these: 1) Find the best position for idle units to stand on (like choke points on the map and places that the enemy units attack more)  2) Find the best location for each of the structures (specially pylons and cannons) 3) Spawning different units according to known enemy units. 4) Perform some upgrades for some units. 5) An AI that only defends (and scores according to its survival time). Maybe it can be merged with an attacking AI later.,True
@parseeval,2018-07-15T18:42:31Z,0,"I wonder two things: first thing is this ai is unable to see ""stacked"" units clearly. It is unable to determine if there is a worker close to a military unit for example. Would it be useful to draw the units with a certain alpha so there is a learnable color for that and many other cases by simply mixing the original colors? And the seccond thing is if it would be useful to have a generic color code instead of hardcoding the color for every type of unit. I guess there is some enum value for each type of entity and if one calculates a kind of ""color hash"" on two channels and add the team on the third, this would be a neat, non-spaghetti code to have a unique, learnable color for every type of unit and every mutation of a unit (like the three different kinds terran of command centers I read about in another comment). What do you think?",True

Inputs are (Economy, Military Strength, Research). Tracking these three inputs allows the A.I. to decide what to build and when based on what's needed. I have also included (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Letting the A.I decide what units to build based on which units counter which other units. However, i'm having a hard time getting the A.I. to weight correctly each unit since when it does go into combat the enemy typically has multiple types of units. I'm trying to avoid writing the actual counter units to each other unit.",True
