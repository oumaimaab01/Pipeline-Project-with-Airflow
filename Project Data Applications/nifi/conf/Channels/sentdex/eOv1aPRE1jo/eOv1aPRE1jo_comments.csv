@maxitube30,2019-02-07T02:19:18Z,0,"hi bud. i have read on python programming.net, that you have played C&C like me. on your idea,what can be a good sistem to indentify tank or soldier in C&C. for starcraft,blizzard have relased API but there is nothing for C&C. We have to use memory scanning,or computer vision?",True
@npuldon,2018-10-22T19:27:12Z,0,"+sentdex Ever consider training an AI to play Factorio?  It's a super awesome sandbox game and the 2nd highest rated game of all time on Steam.  Check it out sometime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zqCPFOXTI   Most of the redditors I've spoken to on the subject say it would be nearly impossible to specify a reward system for the AI well enough to make it work since the sandbox is so much more open than eSports games in general.  They say that even after you programming the AI to understand the mechanics of what is possible specifying a goal like ""build a rocket in the shortest time possible"" would never work.  Even with training for many millions of game hours.  What do you think?",True
@bobbyv3,2018-08-03T20:49:25Z,0,What are you using as your development machine?  I presumed you would use MacOS over Windows for Python development.,True
@adityachawla2163,2018-08-01T18:25:45Z,0,"You could incorporate AI for specific choices and meanwhile you write logic for other choices and then slowly let loose on the AI by letting it make other choices too. A great way of doing that is having a logic for every choice but having a percentage say X. Then you let AI make the choice X percent of the time and if the choice is hard to make, you keep X very low. But later, you start increasing X as your AI grows smart enough to compensate for some losses in favor of training and eventually it will be the AI making all the choices. This way, a lot of what your AI learns might depend on your own logic that you begin with but if you train for long enough after increasing X for all choices to 100, AI will definitely develop a  unique style.   Good work! Appreciate it a lot :)",True
@trevorseitz502,2018-08-01T13:27:17Z,0,Is there a way to map the decisions made with the initialÂ hardcoded AI to the Machine learning algorithm to get the ML AI a head start on the learning process?,True
@dxamphetamin,2018-08-01T08:36:59Z,0,will you give us training data or do we have to get it on our own?,True
@tstRdaBrute,2018-08-01T08:35:16Z,0,"i think it would be more efficient if you so called try to make a group of units before sending them to battle. Also i dont know if the ai is able to use chat but if it can scout should see building and type on chat if there is an existing one or not (you can do that for location on gas atleast). The reason for this for you bot to improve later on by if you see either the enemy collecting crystals only or is it already out on gas. The reason behind it if you ever want to try your bot out against players or against stronger bots(would be rly fun later on) should predict a tactic which should be built upon the enemy is out on gas or not (early gas means sooner ""techning"" means more advenced units and if you see that either you can mass zealot and rush them before they finish or just expand as well to tech too) And in starcraft everything is about time frame so if you see the enemy on gas before xy time with scout you could built in a true/false statment then you dont need to build cybernetic core or other base make gateway and overwhelm them with zealots. That could have been an option to choose. I think the ai should have choose between strategies then you indentify those strategies instead of choosing between units. As a protos with 3 different strategies you should can beat up hard bots as well. Msg me if you are interested i can explain them in more detail if you want to beat harder bots. Love your vid keep going!",True

@Trpodification1,2018-07-31T21:09:35Z,0,"After your last post on this series I've started working on a Brawlhalla AI. Thanks a lot for your series with SC and GTA V, they are really useful. Currently, there is no api for that game, tho, and I am trying to combine my working CNN( which is performing .. eh.. it's moving ) with an lstm, since it's really useful in that type of situation ( even more than in GTA V case ). Do You have any tips or incoming tutorials on that?",True
@orperry8064,2018-07-31T20:36:18Z,0,i think u should use attack move. its looks like the units just walk to their way point and do not notice the enemy units. attack move should fix it,True
@benjaminjaton3597,2018-07-31T20:16:23Z,0,The runtime was the random choice or you trained the model already? Also how long did it take you to train this model?,True
@jakubklecki2963,2018-07-31T18:23:01Z,0,"I just wonder if this random choices AI will be good enough to win any matches against medium bot, I guess you have to play a looooooooot of games to get some data from winning matches to be able to analyze them...",True
@AlexanderKazakovIE,2018-07-31T18:20:01Z,1,Hi @sentdex. Really love your tutorials. Now with a scripted bot I can consistently win with Very Hard AI when playing real-time with bot's support :)  A question about the tutorial. It seems there is no choice to attack the enemy base anymore. Does this make all possible learnable strategies to be fully defensive ones?,True
@tormentedbacon4573,2018-07-31T18:06:28Z,5,"Love the series, haven't got to watch this complete episode yet, but I've done a lot of work on my own bot based on your previous tutorials and just wanted to say that you can reduce the amount of lag a ton by reducing the overall APM's.     For example, there is no need to call distrubute_workers on every single step.    Nor is there a reason to update and check to build a building on every single step iteration that game has.        So, I just implemented a strategy with the iterations and creating a gap, where you only do the actions every X amount of iterations.     I was able to do this and reduce the amount of lag I had a TON.  I no longer have times where game speed is slower than realtime, despite realtime being false.    And this was just with a gap of 20 iterations on military and 40 iterations on economics.   I'm pretty sure that can be extended out much further, those were just numbers I plugged in to start with.  I'm going to transfer that over to being time based, rather than iterations based to do that, but same concept etc.     Free's up a ton of resources.",True
@followMLS,2018-07-31T17:47:43Z,0,"i dont want to be mean, but if you keep making the AI without getting more knowledge about the game, you wont get far. Please contact someone with knowledge about the game and get some insight.  I was a master player when i was active, currently i dont play active but watch other streamers or some tournaments. If you want some insight, feel free to contact me",True
