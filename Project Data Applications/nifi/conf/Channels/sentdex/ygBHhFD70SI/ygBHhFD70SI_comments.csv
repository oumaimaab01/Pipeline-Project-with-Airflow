@JimmyWestra,2015-03-14T01:59:21Z,0,Just stuck at install python amd64. I'm not necessarily stuck but the computer stopped at 57%load python-openss1 on clean boot for virtual server ubuntu 14.10. I'm basically installing this to have fun with ubuntu and for now the only fun part is to have this OS actually give me a working splash screen to let me know I finally achieved goal let alone an Ubuntu interface..Do you have any suggestions?,True
@sentdex,2013-09-30T16:19:38Z,0,"Yep. Once you hit the 2GB mark, your program will grind to a halt and die.  As for installing: If the module was simple enough, it wouldn't matter...ie: if it was just a group of .py files. If it is a python wrapper around a C app, then yeah, you must reinstall for sure. Definitely worth having the 2GB limit lifted though!",True
