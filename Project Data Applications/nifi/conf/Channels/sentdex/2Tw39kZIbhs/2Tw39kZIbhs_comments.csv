@andrewpeters8357,2016-12-14T10:28:02Z,26,"Good video, thanks Jesse.  I just have two points to add for beginners.  1. 'with' is recommended by Python 2.7 docs to use for handling files. The first block of code in the video can be re-written as:  with open(""dict.pickle"", ""wb"") as file:      pickle.dump(example_dict, file)  And just that. No need to close the file, it will close automatically as soon as that 'with' section is done. There's also some functionality related benefits to using 'with' over manually stating to close the file. E.g. if you have a return in that 'with' block then the file will close as soon as it returns. The second block can be re-written in the same way.  2. Look into cPickle. Runs much faster and is the exact same as pickle bar some areas.",True
