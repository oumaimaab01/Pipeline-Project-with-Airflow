@carlosquinones7560,2021-08-23T01:19:19Z,0,"I typed in this prompt:  During the U.S. withdrawal and evacuation from Afghanistan, the Taliban mobilized rapidly across the country, taking province after province. After the Afghan military forces surrendered to the Taliban with very little resistance, the Taliban proceeded to swiftly crack down on any pockets of resistance in Kabul, eliminate any opposition and rival groups, such as IS in Afghanistan, and return Afghanistan to pre-U.S. invasion rule, where women's education is outlawed and female institutions were segregated.   Joe Biden, current president of the United States, is under fire from all sides for his decision to withdraw the Armed Forces of the United States from a 20-year war with the Taliban after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001 right after the September 11 attacks. There has been a rare bipartisan opposition to Biden's decision and his nemesis, Donald J. Trump, seized the opportunity to attack Biden in order to hurt his reputation. There has also been negative media coverage regarding the poorly-handled, rushed evacuation of personnel, civilians and refugees on the Kabul international airport, where the remaining U.S. forces are stationed and where the last glimmer of hope for Afghan refugees is located.   Biden's approval ratings have dipped following the withdrawal and negative media coverage of the evacuation but Biden's approval ratings have been consistently positive during the first 7 months of his presidency due to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the expanded vaccine distribution, which will receive FDA approval shortly.   After the withdrawal and evacuation are finished, Biden will focus his efforts on countering China's efforts at a steady expansion, repositioning naval and aerial forces to the disputed South China Sea and allies in the region, such as Japan, South Korea and Guam. Whatever impact this may have at Biden's re-election chances and his relationship with America's enemies is unknown.  Got this result:  Donald J. Trump, now president of the United States, seized the opportunity to attack Biden during a rally in Ohio, where Biden is expected to announce his campaign in a few weeks. Trump said that he had known that Biden was considering withdrawing from Afghanistan, but he said he was happy with his decision and Biden made the right decision. Trump said that Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan is ""ridiculous,"" claiming that Biden will be remembered as ""Biden the Lame"" and ""Biden, the Leaker."" Trump also accused Biden of ""throwing in the towel,"" ""losing"" the war in Afghanistan, and ""giving up."" The negative coverage of Biden's withdrawal decision received a rare bipartisan criticism in American media. Trump also mentioned Biden's decision to withdraw from Vietnam and his criticism of the Obama administration in order to deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic. Biden's announcement was delayed until May 15 due to the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. government's response to the spread of the virus and Trump's approval ratings have risen since then.  Citation  References  Category:2020 in politics Category:History of the United States (1991–present) Category:2020 in the United States Category:Afghanistan–United States relations Category:2020-related timelines  Well boys, pack it in now: We're leaving Nam.",True

Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English. *continuation:* The herd of creatures had been isolated from the outside world for millions of years and as a result, they’d developed their own language. They called it Unicor.  The discovery has been dubbed a “unicorn of the Andes”. However, it isn’t just a single creature; the herd has now been officially named “the valley of the unicorns”.  The unicorns are actually not a real species; they’re just a combination of various animals living together.

@IceMetalPunk,2021-08-10T21:14:07Z,71,"For the past three or four weeks, I've been playing with both GPT-J and GPT-3, mostly for generating prose. (I originally tried to get GPT-3 to generate unit tests for code, but it didn't do very well on that for anything more complex than simple arithmetic functions. And then, of course, OpenAI x Github came out with fine-tuned Copilot, so I'm already obsolete on that :P ) I've been comparing GPT-3's DaVinci model, which is 175 billion parameters, to GPT-J's 6 billion parameter model. There is *definitely* a noticeable difference in quality. J gets stuck in loops more often, mixes peoples' names up more often, and fails to understand the implications of what it's said (i.e. ""he took off his coat"" in one sentence, then ""his coat was uncomfortable on his shoulders"" a few sentences later). GPT-3 does that sometimes as well, but not nearly as often. (Though a few times it's decided that a character's pet dog could talk, so... you know.)  If I remember right, the initial paper announcing GPT-3 showed a monotonically increasing trend for performance with respect to network size, so I'm sure GPT-J would be as good as GPT-3 if it reached the 175 billion parameters (though much, much slower, without the massive and expensive hardware Musk & Microsoft money affords OpenAI). I'm just excited for the future. This may not be General AI yet, but large transformers trained on tons of varied data seem to be closing that gap into GAI remarkably quickly, and I expect GPT-6 or GPT-7 to cross that threshold if such a thing is ever practical enough to build.

@anonymousanon4822,2021-08-06T21:54:57Z,146,"14:24 As a german this is very interesting to me. Because the sentence contains a grammatical error: Instead of ""der KI"" it should be ""die KI"" because for some reason intelligence is female in german. I suspect that it's inherited the mistake from its training data since english only has one article versus german's three articles, which many translation programs (including google translate) struggle with. Very interesting to see it ""fail"" at this relatively easy task while succeding in writing functioning code that even fulfills multiple requirements.",True
