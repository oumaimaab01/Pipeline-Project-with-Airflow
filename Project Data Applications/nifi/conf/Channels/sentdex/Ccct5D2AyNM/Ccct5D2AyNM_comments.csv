I'm not entirely sure why, but a lot of people don't like Tkinter. They would prefer use something like wxPython. Now, I'm wondering what the big deal is between them? I've read Stackoverflow people suggesting that you go you out of your way _not_ to use Tkinter. I think Tkinter is pretty amazing and an awesome choice for GUI.
