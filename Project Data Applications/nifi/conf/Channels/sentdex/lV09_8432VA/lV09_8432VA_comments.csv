Nice lucky cup [as always] , but i still have some questions/non questions: 1. i try to make a classifier with 3 classes , allies , enemies and pure nothing . When i train model with allies and enemies it has really good accuracy compared to when I add the class 'nothing' [ I have equal amounts of images of allies and enemies and 'nothing' (images of nothing are random buildings or paths in the game)] , so my question is : can I add option 'Do nothing' without adding an entire class of 'nothing' photos?  2. when I save and load my model and then predict first element of it , no I don't get an error , but I get a result like 0,89 or something like that and I don't get what it is (and google didn't help me)  3. in video you 'tried' a lot of options that consists of different numbers of conv_layers , dense_layers and nodes , but is it a good idea to try also a new optimizer/loss function  with this same method?   4.
