@sharedknowledge6640,2018-03-14T23:28:26Z,0,"Welcome to Google. Your choice of ""black box"" was perhaps even more appropriate than you know. Google has created a work environment where the emphasis is on New New New and few employees are given any incentive to support and refine existing Google products. Google is also internally obsessed with security. And while that's a good thing in some ways one of the painful side effects is the left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing. So it's often a black box to even other Google employees. Google is all about creating firewalls and other partitions that internally divide the company into countless pieces that are intentionally inhibited from communicating with each other.   The end result are things like the YouTube demonetization debacle and a huge lack of anything resembling genuine transparency. The only thing that's transparent is Google makes 95+% of their profit leveraging what amounts to spyware to essentially sell the personal data of nearly all their users. Google is also famous for ignoring customer feedback much as Apple does. They know they have a near monopoly in some of their markets and, unless you're Proctor and Gamble threatening to pull ads, they don't seem to care what most anyone else thinks including failing to listen to some of their best YouTube content providers. They seem to do only the bare minimum to avoid an outright revolt.   Google has been VERY evil in leveraging their way into dominance with little regard for all those they've unfairly trampled along the way. Don't even get me started, for example, on their unethical intellectual property practices. It's a bunch of smart people duped into working for the Evil Empire wrapped in a colorful seemingly friendly wrapper. Don't be fooled. The top brass at Google mainly only cares about their share price.",True

@GameKiller48,2017-12-17T20:49:52Z,0,"@sentdex A few questions and suggestions:  First, regarding the adpocalypse: I suggest that you take a look at this rather indepth video about what could be potential causes for your videos to be demonitized: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4NgO69RprE - a 'too long: didn't watch' for it could be the following: a group of people noticed short number codes in the youtube source code on video-pages, which have an impact on whether a video gets monitized for not - they then used machine learning to classify youtube videos to make an educated guess what these codes could mean, coming to the conclusion that they encode the categories in which way a video could be 'problematic' for advertisers. Maybe it would be interesting to see which your demonitized videos fall into?  Second, also regarding the adpocalypse: seeing as you are already in the field of machine learning, wouldn't it be possible for you to make a few experiments on this matter? You mentioned that you guess that automatically created captions are also used to classify the content of a video. One thing one could try would be the following: Is it possible to train a GAN on youtube videos, so that the automated caption system either A) produces captions so inaccurate that they no longer have an impact on the advertisement status, while the audio stays indistinguishable to a human audience, or B) changes the audio in a way that the automated captions end up as a predetermined text? If B is implemented, one could try to automatically generate variations of the text you said, where as few words as possible are changed, which in turn could be (after uploading and verifying a large amount of videos generated this way) used as a dataset to determine which words/phrases/concepts in the captions are able to trigger the not-advertiser-friendly flag.  Thirdly, also in regards to the adpocalypse, but also as a seque to one of your projects: I personally believe that not only the contents of the video, but also the comments below are video are used to classify the content of a video. A video disproportionally attracts people known for commenting under videos which are already classified as 'problematic'? Classify it as 'potentially problematic'. It uses similar language as found under 'problematic' videos? Flag it as 'potentially problematic', etc. So, as another machine learning question or project: is it possible to predict the tags, title, video description or descriptors of the video content using nothing but the comments posted beneath it? Now as a seque to your automated driving in GTA: Is it possible/practical (or maybe even already implemented) to incorporate the twitch chat into training your driving model? Like using the frequency of emotes to signal interesting/review-worthy sections to the model, or using the !reset (or was it !stuck?) command to signal to the model that whatever it did leading up to that moment was most likely not what it was supposed to be doing?  Last but not least a question regarding crypto and blockchain: I'm of similar opinion that many current crypto-currencies are often of little practical use, have significant technical problems or seem to be only about earning the devs and early adopters a quick buck using the ICO. But that leaves the question: which (if any) of the crypto currencies (or maybe other technologies utilizing blockchain) do you find interesting, not from a financial, but purely from a technological point of view?   Always great to see your videos, keep on doing what you are doing, 48 out.",True

@convexprime6506,2017-12-17T19:47:06Z,2,"Youtube's new ""demonetize all the things"" policy seems completely insane to me.  The more that Youtube content creators are paid, the better the incentive to create more and better content.  It drives competition, and basically creates a Youtube content market.  When video's are demonetized, this market is destroyed.  I'm subscribed to a lot of channels on Youtube.  I've seen a number of channels completely collapse over the last 6 months.  When all your videos are suddenly not making any money, creating content on Youtube very quickly becomes not worth the effort.  This is eventually going to cost Youtube, and that's the part I really don't understand.  If they stop paying their content creators, they will have less content to run ads on, and eventually less advertisers will want to advertise on their low brow content.

@sentdex,2017-12-17T15:07:31Z,159,"This video was uploaded Dec 14th at 10:40 am as ""unlisted"" as suggested by YouTube. It was marked as ""suitable for advertisers"" for over 24 hours, giving me the impression that surely that was enough time and it was safe to publish. After 30 hours, still unlisted, THEN, it was suddenly marked as not-suitable. No email, no notification. I requested a review and ~35 hrs later it was approved.   There's such little communication (actually, NO communication), and how are we supposed to know when we upload a video to unlisted that it's been enough time that the demonetization boogieman wont strike? Even just a tiny bit more information would greatly benefit creators.",True
