@GarethDavidson,2022-09-17T11:08:06Z,0,"I like the cut of your jib sir! Great videos, it's nice to see someone confident, knows what they're doing and is a natural teacher. It feels like you're primarily did it to share your knowledge and made videos because that supported the main goal. Sounds silly but there's a lot of guff on YouTube that is first and foremost a video to watch  Some feedback though, code review style:  You should have explained what that 1 was all about. Everything else made perfect sense, but hand-waving over that sorta left me with a gap where I was getting distracted thinking about wtf it meant and had to rewind. In fact it's still bugging me. Gonna have to look it up.  The powers of two thing is 'cause everything is transistors and 0 or 1. So they're even numbers, they align nicely with memory, are faster with less waste etc.  Grumbling about magic numbers in other people's code, then putting them in yours.. tsk tsk. Would have been better to make width and height variables to encourage this new generation of ML barbarians to give things decent names.  Could have explained that ""rectified linear"" is just ""floor(0)"", had to look it up and frowned at the whole of mathematics for their hyperpathalogical superfluoustic jargonization. The stuff about scaling the outputs kinda lost both of us too.  Finally, religious issue: embrace functional! You get the view vs reshape thing, but overwrite variables and prefer classes with mutable state. Functions are much cleaner other than passing parameters, better to test, easier to reuse. Might cut down on the copypasta in the AI world if people are reusing functions.  Great vids though like I said, pace is great, feels natural and the plot thing and your efficiency almost made me *want* to use a jupyter notebook as my interpreter. I probably would if I wasn't a snob about unit tests 😂",True

@RedShipsofSpainAgain,2019-09-25T02:00:59Z,0,"Great vid Harrison thanks.  Regarding choosing batch size,  yes typically the larger the batch size, the faster your model converges.   But setting your batch size too large will result in an out_of_memory error.  So it's important to calculate the largest batch size possible without exceeding your CUDA memory limit.   But one thing I've never gotten a straight answer is this:     ""What's the largest batch size you can choose, as a function of  1)  your particular GPU memory size,  2)  the size (MB, KB, etc) of your training examples (maybe GBs if training very large images), and 3)  the size of your model parameters   all three of these must fit inside your GPU memory.  So in theory there should be a formula to calculate the largest possible batch size.  Something like GPU_mem_size - model_weights_params_size = remaining memory for training samples.    Then take that value and divide it by the typical size of a single training sample (image file or whatever).  The result of this division, call it n, is theoretically the largest batch size you can fit in your GPU.  Then you would probably round down to the nearest multiple of 8.   I'm probably leaving something out of this equation, but that's the general idea.   Any thoughts on a straightforward approach to calculating this theoretical max batch size?  Thanks Harrison (or anyone else who happens to know the answer)",True
@abdulsalamaboubakar4059,2019-09-25T00:38:41Z,0,I think for the batch_size they use base 8 because 1 byte is 8 bits.   thanks for the  vid  as well,True

@gutzbenj,2019-09-24T15:40:03Z,0,"Hi I have two concerns: 1) I wonder why you would do a tutorial on a) tensorflow and b) pytorch as I would expect someone who has to apply deeplearning in some way to understand and find at least the differences of tensorflow and pytorch (I mean, you always say it: it's all written down somewhere). Furthermore I'd be surprised if there's someone out there who gets the concept and idea behind deeplearning and has the mathematical knowledge (not that one would know everything) but doesn't know how to google things instead.   2) I think that this whole thing is not really user friendly as often you end up crunching so much data that a personal computer (at least with some weaker hardware) is not capable of processing it in the same speed. This way it's less of a tutorial but more of a spectatorship (at least for me).   Looking at your videos, I'd like to see some more summarizing at the end (like haveing some slides like the ones in the beginning where you'd draw the tensors). It feels like it's just too quick to end the series sometimes, where it's just like ""yep that's the result, cya"".
