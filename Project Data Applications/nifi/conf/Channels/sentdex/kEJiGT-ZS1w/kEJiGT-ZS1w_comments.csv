@konstantinospapadopoulos1529,2018-10-28T22:54:02Z,0,"Thank you so much for all the work you have done! Amazing videos! I have one question tho. I tried to backtest the exact same code however the backtest was so much slower, even though the time period was around half the one that you had chosen and my data was also daily. I used the newer version of Quantopian (The ""Daily option"" at the top right is not there anymore, and they have added some code along with initialize and handle_data, but I'm pretty sure I am calculating data on a daily basis as well.) Do you have any idea why that happens?",True
@fanel1900toamna,2018-08-20T15:00:33Z,0,Here's a link to an updated version that works on Quantopian 2: https://www.quantopian.com/posts/sentdexs-quantopian-tutorial-updated-by-me-for-quantopian-2-algorithm-1-videos-1-3,True
@Grepoan,2018-04-13T07:42:47Z,0,"Great video as always.  I am a python programmer learning finance.   At the end,  you said ""Our total returns were only 60.9%, but that is compared to 80% from the benchmark"".  Just to make sure that I understand 'the goal', we want to 'beat' the benchmark, correct?    Therefore -- as you implied by saying ""SMA Crossover is not that powerful"" -- cam we say that this algorithm did not 'win' today?",True
