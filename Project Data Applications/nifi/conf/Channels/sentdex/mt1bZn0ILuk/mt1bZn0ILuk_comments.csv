@krukhlis,2020-05-17T01:08:44Z,1,"Well, yes and no. If you check price for Jeston X NX kit -- it's $400 USD w/o taxes. Really, with a performance of barely ~2 times better than regular Nano the price is 3 times more??? As owner of 3 Jetson Nano boards I feel fooled. Potentially, this new board fixes majority of hardware issues of Nano, especially from the performance/power consumption point of view( my JN used in self-driving model car project consumes 3 times more power than 3 cameras, Lidar, 2 brushless motors and independent video  TX module). With all the optimization, stripped down version of OS with all usability and services crap stripped off. I thought new version will be fixing issues. Sort of evolution. Maximum that I feel one should pay for J X NX is $250 USD. But ... 400 -- no way. Especially when I convert it to CAD and add %13 taxes.",True
@morthim,2020-05-16T23:30:47Z,1,"so i know you said you would allow people to borrow some compute time to run on your super mega device. but before i get anything like that i'm trying to figure out a number of interim projects just to build up my base skills. one of the ones that i have in mind is to make a voice analysis bot, and the best source for samples and method i can come up with is to download ""live"" television with subtitles, to scrub out the video channel so it just is audio and subtitles and to train a recurrent neural net one a variety of english language channels.   is there a better option than that? i'm concerned about not having enough accent diversity and having ""irish man stuck in voice activated elevator"" syndrome.  ""what floor would you like to go to?"" ""fah"" ""i'm sorry i don't understand that"" ""opin da bloomin door, ya english fink"" ""i'm sorry i don't understand that"" ""aut!"" ""i'm-"" ""led mi aut!"" ""i'm sorry i don't understand that? would you like me to open the doors?"" ""aye!"" ""you what?"" ""plus led me aut. i'll take the stairs""   also if you don't mind giving a little bit of free help. do you have any advice for multiplexing? in this video i noticed that they seem to be doing per frame calculations, but they could condense the compute cost of real time systems by having delta frames. they do the operation for 2 frame, and then they switch the source, allowing one device to work for all the cameras. my educational project is something similar. downloading 30 secconds of audio with text from a number of different sources, and then swaping through different sources seems like it would better fit the underlying source better. wait. maybe instead of using live television, internet videos might work better. there would be more data, but the subtitles probably better fit the sounds. longer videos could be chunked down into 30 seccond clips.   that may have fixed the problem. but i'll post to leave my embarrassing ignorance in public for posterity. if you have any advice, or if this kind of thing is part of the book, let me know.",True

The tinyML book has a similar format with some chapters free, and supporting video series by the author, Pete Warden. Shows how to run ML models on an Arduino 33 BLE sense, as well as other low cost embedded chips, using Tensorflow lite. They are reducing the date size, and model size by using 8 bit signed integers. It's called quantization. Fascinating, not to mention about to flip IOT on its head. On device machine learning.",True
@morthim,2020-05-16T19:53:16Z,0,"so it costs 5.7x what i have, and performs at 5x what i have, in terms of terra operations. it might be good or better, but it doesn't seem quite enough to discard what i have. $400 is a lot of electricity.   if training scales only linearly, and is based in tops, reducing training time by a factor of 5 might be better, but it kinda depends on how long training takes. you would only see a major difference if models on average take less than 30 minutes but more than 1, or more than 2 hours but less than 5, or more than 9.  in those sweet spots you would be able to find something to distract you while it -compiles- trains. letting something train over night as you sleep should be fine, it only creates a real difference when talking about major disharmonies of time, do you want it on doing nothing while you sleep? maybe/maybenot something taking 10 hours or 2 are kinda in the same position where both require a distraction. and the times are long enough that both will cause you to forget any ideas you have in mind.   it is weird but unix-like task schedualing made even easier seems like it would create a bigger sell. it would allow bulk training of multiple models.   how does it compare to using gpus? you mentioned before that you have a pretty great system, how does the training time relate between the two?   an interesting option to say the least.",True
