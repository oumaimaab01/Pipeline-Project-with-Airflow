@zipper0712,2018-09-06T03:51:07Z,15,4 years after that google link isnt working anymore. but changing it to images.google instead of the normal google query works.  images.google.com/searchbyimage?image_url= + imagepath will work   :D,True
@realyogi007,2018-08-06T09:01:05Z,1,"in the google path we need to use googlepath varialbe as  googlepath = 'https://images.google.com/searchbyimage?image_url=' + imagepath  to work.  Notice that ""images.google.com"" instead of ""google.com"" which was mentioned at the time, when  @sentdex produced this video.  Regex needs some correction.

@mulchi01,2014-12-19T23:45:36Z,0,"I noticed something about python and regexes. If the document you search get's too long (and i haven't determined the size yet but i had it happen on documents with merely a few kilobytes) a simple  re.findall(regex, string)  just stops to find matches. It does a bunch, but then stops in the middle of the document. That holds especially true the more complex the regex is, though easy regexes are still prone to it.  The only reliable option i found was to actually compile the regex into a regex object before you use it (if the same regex is used often, just put it into a global scope).  So i had to do  regex = re.compile(regex)  and later in the code i used it with  regex.findall(string)  That method has yet to fail me. I just mention it, since some google responses can be massive, and if you really want to catch all matches it's better to be sure.",True
