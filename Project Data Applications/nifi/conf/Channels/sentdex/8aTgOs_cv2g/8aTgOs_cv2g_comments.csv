@jcf3300,2017-08-01T19:55:44Z,0,"I'm not sure what the issue is here, but even though I associated *.py files with IDLE within WinSCP's preferences, everytime I double click a python file (e.g. the init file for our app), it spits out an empty file. However, WinSCP itself indicates the file is of the same size as that on the server and, indeed, the file exists with content (checked via 'head __init__.py') on the server, too. I've been able to avoid this problem by working with FileZilla instead, but I'd rather follow along with the tutorials as closely as possible. Any ideas how to get WinSCP to work properly anyone?",True
