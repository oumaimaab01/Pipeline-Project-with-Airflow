@fanel1900toamna,2018-08-30T01:21:09Z,0,"I'm running  this demo on a GeForce GTX 770 OC (Compute capability 3.0, 1536 CUDA cores) with 4GB of video memory. The tensorflow model (ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28) takes as much video memory as it possibly can (3.5GB) and the framerate is a joke :) . I get a somewhat constant 0.15 FPS (GTA runs at 800x600). Oddly enough, even without running GTA I still get the same FPS.  @Harrison maybe you should do a demo using YOLO (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). I think it is much faster than these models and there's plenty of python binding libraries for it. (https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py , https://github.com/gliese581gg/YOLO_tensorflow)",True

@junweima,2017-12-08T07:36:39Z,2,"actually reinforcement learning could still be used even if you don't have explicit reward. you can have -1 reward every frame or so for not reaching a certain speed. and you can have a really low reward for decellerating. at least I think it's good for racing. for safe driviing tho, I think you probably need something more complex.",True

IDK if you have heard of AMD's RX Vega, but if you have, would that be a good choice? I would like to have FreeSync for games. Are there APIs that support OpenCL? ex. Theano.
