But this time it won't launch even after reboot. I tried to follow the instructions given here: https://serverfault.com/questions/288457/python-idle-just-doesnt-start-up which basically deletes the file inside the .idlerc folder. I did and it too didn't work. The console however still works perfectly fine.  I thought (since I am a noob) that perhaps I need to install the correct python which is 64-bit (I actually installed 32 though my machine is 64-bit). I installed the new 64-bit and it all got worse. All my .py files are now gone. Any suggestions how I can fix this, especially reviving my .py files?  The python 35 Win32 has a different folder from Win64. Thanks!",True

Yeah, stupid mistake, I'm an idiot.  If it's not clear, I named the code file ""urllib.py"" when I saved it without thinking at all and then was puzzled why the code appeared not to work until I did some googling.  Also, I had a question about SendKeys, you've got a tutorial on here for that too but I was wondering if there isn't a version for Python 3?  It looks like it only exists up to Python 2.7.  Is there an alternative you'd recommend for Python 3?

There's another one which I believe is more modern and more well maintained (but I don't think it works with 3.X, whereas I'm almost sure Mechanize does) and more Pythonic, called Scrapy, so you could check that out :D  Scrapy: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy Mechanize: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/",True

Because if you use sleep() to pause between steps for a stepper motor or for a ultrasound sensor, you are forced to do things after another... not parallel...  Would you divide the routines in different programs and run them parallel?  I hope you understand my question and I would really appreciate a video about that! :-)  Thanks so much!!",True
