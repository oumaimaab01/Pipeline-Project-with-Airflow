@aperyon1990,2016-01-27T18:29:29Z,0,"Amaziiing! i was really waiting for a django tutorial from you! My project is on flask and its just too massive to move to django, and pretty close to finish it up and turn it into a business, but as soon as its launched im planning to learn django more profound than just following these vids and finally move to django!! as you said, the freedom of flask... i find it more of a hinderance than help, hours of googling for solutions while there not even one (but too many ways to solve (somehow)). Very excited and thank your for existing at all! :DDD",True

@JordanKidd14,2016-01-20T04:17:32Z,345,"I have to give you a ""thank you!"" for these awesome videos. I was a CS student in Michigan over the past few years and sadly Python was not used in any classes, but I really enjoyed using it in my own small projects. I learned Flask, DigitalOcean, and setup Apache with your help. I then created a new website and used it in my senior design project that interfaced with a mobile application. You saved me so much time by helping me understand what was happening, instead of scouring documentation for days on end. I recently interviewed and got a new job as a Python developer right out of college too! I can honestly say you've changed my life by creating these tutorials. I appreciate each one you make. Please keep up the great work.",True
