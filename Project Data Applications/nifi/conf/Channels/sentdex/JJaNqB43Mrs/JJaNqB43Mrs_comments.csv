@sakkzz,2018-09-19T16:55:55Z,0,I'm planning on learning Python pretty soon but I have a question. I play a game that updates once a week and the game has a specific feature that is pretty annoying but is easily fixed by going into the games files and deleting it but the problem is that every time it updates the name of folder which the file I want to delete changes. Any way around that? Maybe make it search for the specific file name that I want to delete,True
