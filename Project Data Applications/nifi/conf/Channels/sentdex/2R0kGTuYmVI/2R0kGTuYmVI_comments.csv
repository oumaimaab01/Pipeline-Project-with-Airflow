@johnsmith-000,2022-09-21T15:57:44Z,15,"I've been playing with Midjourney and Stable Diffusion for a couple of days now, and it's amazing, but also disturbing and scary. I have no doubt AI will in no time approach near perfect quality, but what's more alarming, also the originality, so human authors will not have that advantage either. This may well render future generations of artists redundant and feeling inferior. Instead, we may end up with a class of ""prompt whisperers"" where the tallent will not realy be a requirement. Don't get me wrong, I'm super excited with endless possibilities AI offers, but I really don't see why young, tallented people would choose this highly demanding path, only to end up as a performer who can't compare with AI in terms of quality, innovation, let alone speed and as a consequence also the price. True, AI isn't there quite yet, but it is improving at tremendous speed. And it is improving using kind of ""brute force"" approach, i.e. being just fed ever larger quantities of data even without any changes to the core model, not to mention that new models are being launched with comparable speed, too. It will affect most aspect of our lives in pretty much the same way. Many people have been warning about this for years, but nobody paid much attention, as is customary for human race, and we can't blame no one but ourselves. It seems we humans are used to tack a problem only when it is fully developed and running at full speed, something like ""problem rodeo"".

@caileanparis9998,2022-09-21T08:55:14Z,3,"As a digital artist, I’ll say that stable diffusion doesn’t really excite me like mid journey does.  Stable diffusion does what any amateur photoshop user can create, albeit infinitely faster which makes it incredibly useful and powerful.   However MidJourney is and will be the ultimate game changer for digital art and entertainment.  It will be incredibly valuable for quick conceptual ideation and will tremendously reduce rendering times for digital illustrators.  However the need for human artists will still be necessary because you will need the creative/artistic ‘eye’ and knowledge to know what looks good and what doesn’t.  you’ll still need to adjust, edit, compose, and paint over the created images, and that’s why professional artists with training and experience will still be in demand.  Most importantly, you’ll need a creative individual to know exactly what to search for in the prompt,  because the more imaginative you are, the more detailed prompt you can input.  Just remember, people were tripping out when photoshop and digital art became a thing.  Artists were worried that they would all get replaced and that the quality of art will suffer.

@Lawrence741,2022-09-20T14:16:46Z,1,"Here my experiences as an artist who drew from cartoon to semi-realism and realism. (Long text)  I have tried SD, MJ and Dall-E 2, with the intention of making passable digital art images. Composition-wise they are all lacking, perspectives were really hard to do and most of it looked flat and not dynamic at all, but if I would choose a winner in that regard it would be Dall-E 2.  SD is really bad at doing that. As someone who is quite good at imagining compositions and styles, this was a trainwreck, especially when you try to achieve very specific fantasy motives. I don't even want to talk about it, it was that bad. It seemed to be quite good in realistic images of real people, but couldn't nearly achieve the flair a digitally drawn image has.  MJ on the other hand was style-wise a master generator and the faces were amazingly crisp. Atleast for the trial time I used it. It had the look of a great digital painting you could expect from artstation and I was very stunned about the quality. Still one thing bothered me, which was that you couldn't put as fantastic word combination into the AI and make a picture out of it and it resulted in very cartoony images which I didn't want to see.  Dall-E 2 on the other hand could do exactly that. The AI did me sometimes dirty with their filter system to not generate inappropiate images (what that even means, considering my prompts). Still it was by far the best in portraying what I wanted to see. We talk about ""ducks with fedora in leatherboots, swinging it's sword"" or ""colossal turtle carrying a ballista on it's back"" (not the exact prompts, just to give you an idea what I wanted to see). This was something all of the others did extremely poorly or didn't do at all. Style-wise it was very inconsistend and sometimes I need to retry to get a style suited for my taste. The faces were sadly most of the time just pieces of flesh mixed together, but as an artist, I could fix these myself. So stay away from Dall-E when it comes to faces. Still overall it achieved what I was looking for.  If it would be possible I would love to see the MJ style and face generation together with the Dall-E prompt generation. This would be an amazing duo. As someone who has less demands when it comes to image generators you might be fine with SD, but from a standpoint of an artist there is a long way to go for most of the AI's imagination, however MJ and Dall-E 2 are going in a good direction. Means you artists out there are still needed. Not a single image generation did what I imagined and if I would have intended to invest all the time, I would have done far better compositions than what I generated here.",True

@Veptis,2022-09-16T22:51:10Z,0,"I did skip this video in my 3 month long watch later because it's so interesting and relevant. For a university project I decided to build a dataset to try and have a text to video model. But not by going to frames... Instead by doing text to code where the code is a fragment shader that renders an interactive and dynamic image at any resolution you want. If you ever found Shadertoy online, that's basically what my dataset currently is. I used their API to grab all the public+API which is maybe less than half of all shaders which I could crawl instead.   The first version of the dataset is already on Huggingface but I am writing about the motivation and others works. So that now has to include all the text to image models directly.  Now I even consider rendering out a small frame sequence of the shader to make it a bigger parallel dataset. Perhaps a model could learn to write shadercode for a texture/transition it sees. Or it could learn how to compile shadercode. Perhaps you just look at the names of functions or something. Too many ideas, and not enough computational power.    Since you are starting from an contextualized Text embedding (some transformer), and then run it through a generating model, in this case some low res diffusion and then some added upscaling diffusion models. What the Dall-E 2 blog post made clear is that they also allow you to feed an image embedding into the prompt as well as a mask to make specific edits. Doesn't look like such a combination has been done for the Stable Diffusion model, but that shouldn't take long. Also sampling paths through the latent space to make videos could be great. And it looks like you did publish an exploration on the idea.   My university doesn't have a course on generative image models yet, so do I even go for a masters in Artificial Intelligence if they don't?",True

@joshuascholar3220,2022-09-09T07:05:33Z,3,"A few points, 1) you can get bigger images out of stable diffusion, depending on how much memory your card and cpu have. 2) if you're willing to put up with slow generation, you can use somewhat smaller card.  My laptop has a 1660 ti with 6gb of ram and my cpu has 32 gb ram.  It can generate up to 640 x 640 images with a script that trades memory for time, ie uses less gpu ram but takes much longer.   You probably need at least 16 gig of cpu ram.  Note that since it's not an RTX card, you have to disable half-precision optimizations that would also save memory at the cost of slightly cruder images. 3) you can get artwork instead of realistic renders out of stable diffusion.  Play with it.  For instance at the moment I'm just throwing unrelated objects at it, and it tends to pick a painted style in the case of things that don't go together in any reasonable way.  4) if you specify the name of a photographer or illustrator or artist, it's very good at copying style",True

Emad and the Stable Diffusion team just opened up a huuuuge Pandora's box, and accelerated image synthesis like mad... A few days ago I generated a Dwayne Johnson in a T pose, used it on PIFuHD to generate a 3D model of it, used Actorcore's Auto-Rig to rig it, then I could import it into Blender, Unreal Engine etc. Without having any talent in design, modeling, animating etc., in just a couple hours... This is completely insane how fast things have gone in the past few months or even weeks !

@bhaveshladdagiri2675,2022-09-03T17:30:51Z,0,"A quick question, how much VRAM does stable-diffusion actually need coz you say it needs 10 GB but i was able to run it locally with my 6GB GPU (RTX 2060). Does the stable diffusion pipeline use hugging face accelerate to make some optimizations to the model to be able to run it on how much ever VRAM is available?",True
@Kram1032,2022-09-03T17:22:29Z,0,"I find that Stable Diffusion is much less able to incorporate multiple parts of a prompt into an image than MidJourney. You get great results, and you can get quite specific, but if you go too wild (Porsche Truck clearly is fine still), you eventually end up with it ignoring a bunch of stuff. Midjourney can really pull together completely bonkers unrelated concepts.  I really would love to know how Imagen or Parti handle this stuff. They promise to be broader and deeper with their language understanding. But how good are they really? Since they (or an Open Source version of them) aren't available to the world, it's not exactly testable if you aren't a Google Engineer who just so happens to have access.",True

@TheFloatingSheep,2022-09-03T14:54:08Z,0,"You can make it 1024x1024 if you've got the juice for it in your gpu. I was only able to go up to 576x576 with 6 gigs of vram. You can also get a more rectangular picture using 640x448, basically you can sacrifice x-axis resolution for the y-axis resolution or vice versa.   I love that MidJourney's able to produce wallpaper-grade art in 1920x1080 with no problems, I checked and if you try to get Stable Diffusion to produce a 1920x1088 (which is the closest multiple of 64 resolution), it tries to allocate 31.75 gb of vram. That's an absurd amount of vram and I can't help but think there must be some very obvious optimizations that we're not yet making use of. I was thinking of trying to get it to make use of shared memory but Python's not my cup of tea, I'm more of a c-c#-js kinda guy.",True

I know that some artists really dislike this as it takes away the human element, but I do hope this can open up for new kind of material.   As someone who dabbles in writing as a hobbyist, I'd love to get to a point where a model like this could help someone create a visual novel without having to have the necessary artistic skills and time or pay a lot of money to illustrate everything for a project that might not net yourself any money.   And even many visual novels with commercial success needs to be economical with what they want illustrated and not. So I hope this opens up more opportunities for people and that in a few years you're making a simular video about a free model that can create videos from prompts and not just images.   Though I think for these models to take the next step, there needs to be much better ways of guiding the models.",True
