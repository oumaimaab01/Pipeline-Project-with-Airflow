@tlmoller,2020-07-16T09:15:02Z,0,Good to hear your background. It is essential in your life to get involved in something you like. Forget about making big $$$. This is the wrong focus. Focus on doing what makes you feel good. Yes you need the $ to pay the bills.. But if you do something you really like you tend to get really good at it and there is a good change that someone will pay you for this since you are good at it. It is super hard to make money doing what you do not like to do. But sometimes what you think is really fun can not make any $. Then do it as a hobby and get a job that are still at least half fun. Doing it as a hobby also have the advantage that you can do all the fun part of it as you do not have to care about someone paying for it.,True

I aspire to be an amazing programmer and I've made great strides in learning python, I have taken 2 courses at my university that use python and I have been top of the class in both of them, but watching this video made me realize the only thing I'm actually good at is the basics.   I am very familiar with the structure of code and how python works with itself but I have yet to make the leap and actually apply it towards a project. I am a double major in accounting and comp sci, so finance is obviously a big thing with me, and it looks like you are very familiar with both of those segments as well.   I hope to watch all of your videos, absorb as much information I can, and actually do something great.   You are like a professor that I get to know... but has no idea who I am!

I have total 8 commands which is ""Forward"", ""Backward"",""Left"" and etc, whichwhen  i say the command, the robot will move accordingly.

@m41kdevelops41,2016-11-06T12:50:29Z,0,"Thanks for that awesome video  I got a few questions :  1 -  I'm a good back - end developer - If I may say so myself - . I do websites functions very well ( and now got into games with pygame thanks to you !). But the problem is i'm a HORRIBLE front-end developer! I write HTML and CSS at a medium level. but regarding my design sense and skills, they are just ... horrible. I'd like some advice to work around that.  2 - I'm from Egypt, but my English is very good that I could teach myself programming from free online tuts like yours ( a huge thank you !). I have been working with PHP for 3 years and got into Python as soon as I watched your tuts. But in that period of time, I never made any money from programming. Zero Bucks ( or pounds in my case ). Moreover,  In Egypt tech jobs ( programming specifically ) are almost impossible to get ( because they are few and not really worth it regarding money ). the questions now : - How to market myself well in order to get personal jobs for side-cash - Also how to create a portfolio that could get me hired in companies ( even foreign companies which would be best for me ) - Any extra tips for me ?  3 - I don't have any degrees regarding computers at all. will that affect my career if i'm planning to work as a python programmer at a company ?  I know that was so much to read but the answers to these questions are very important to me. again thanks a lot for your awesome channel.",True

@davidnelson4563,2016-11-06T01:18:29Z,0,"I'm curious what your thoughts are about ""formal"" CS education, particularly since you said you don't have any.  I'm currently a student at Georgia Tech's relatively new completely online MS in CS. My undergraduate background was not in this field and so I've been playing a lot of catch up. Your videos have helped a lot with that and I'm very grateful (thanks!). It seems CS is ideally suited for this type of online education, and I imagine eventually there will be undergraduate programs available online as well. Along the way, the whole college model may be altered. I guess I mention this because a lot of what you do seems to supplement the more formal online education now available. In terms of business ideas, I think it would be worth exploring.",True
