@mByyurt,2020-12-13T21:34:15Z,1,My first encounter with your videos was at around 2016. I did not like you back then because I thought you were explaining in such complicated manner for absolute beginners such as me. Now I watch your video and enjoy and understand it thoroughly.,True

@GodsLittlegizmoguy96,2020-06-18T18:53:50Z,0,"I'm sorry, I'm not understanding your choice for output. It looks like if the action = 1, you set the output = [0,1], and if action = 0, you set output = [1,0]. Why is that? Also, can you give more explanation for what y actually is? e.g. what is the y labeled data that we are suppsed to be using as feedback to the current state/action pairs trajectory.",True

@Celiojsf,2019-02-15T10:41:12Z,1,"im not understanding how you can train your model to ""learn"" with this training data you built, because all that you are storing is just a relation of a previous obs and the random action taken, i observed that all actions in the data will be just actions that resulted in a game score of 50 or more but..., isnt better to use the reward of the action on the prev obs, and do some reinforcement learning with that?",True
@aquater1120,2019-01-13T18:17:13Z,0,"I know this video i kinda old, but could somebody please explain to my why exactly we are setting output to be a vector and not a scalar in initial_population function? I dont get it, why does that mean exactly? If there were multiple possible outputs and not just two would we set output to be a vector where on the 0th possition is out desirable action and rest of the vector is just other possible actions in random order?",True

@tobias-stein,2018-05-12T16:23:54Z,1,"Nice tutorial sentdex, thanks.  And by the way, it seems you have to train the model with data samples consisting of (Obs_n, Action_n+1) [where n is the frame]. In my case if if samples data in form of (Obs_n, Action_n) I would not be able to get a final score above 10.0. Once I fixed that, I easily got higher scores.",True
@MauricioMartinez0707,2018-04-26T22:09:43Z,0,"env.reset() returns the initial observation, so you can:  obs = env.reset() for step in range(game_steps):     action = env.action_space.sample()     data.append([obs, action]) # since that's the action taken based on the observation     obs, rew, done, _ = env.step(action)  something like that",True

I have installed cmake via pip3 and follow along this guide here: https://github.com/j8lp/atari-py but nothing worked.

@dLoLe,2017-07-09T14:27:41Z,6,"Awesome.   A few notes:  goal_steps is actually the upper threshold of steps you're willing to do for a game, is that correct? If that's so, the chance of getting 500 steps on random is really small. Either way, I'm not sure goal_steps is really explained too well also, I'm sure there's a method already written for one_hot conversion, but surely you could at least convert it on the fly in the original loop with ""[0,1] if action else [1,0]"" instead of writing a separate for loop for that and iterating   Thank you very much for your help, really helping me there :)",True
