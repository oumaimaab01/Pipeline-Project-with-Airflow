@MrLorgy,2017-07-18T23:12:21Z,7,"FYI (and for others that where equally as confused as I was)   with the vertices you have defined node 7 and 8 on the figure you displayed are actually swapped. I know this because I mapped the cube in paint, and the fact that the two squares had a different pattern greatly confused me until I realized it was because of the vertices definition. *This happened because you broke the rule of only changing 1 of the 3 values at the same time in the previous video* :P   The pattern after the definition is actually  1-2    4-3 and second square is  5-6 7-8  Simply changing node 7 and 8 values should make the same pattern, but that also means changing all the edges. Or you could alternatively just not give a crap that they are listed in the wrong order.",True

@laughy38247357075834,2015-07-12T00:41:06Z,1,I haven't watched the OpenGL series yet but would it be useful in game engines? I'm particularly interested in Panda3D because it's not commonly used but it's not very resource intensive and perfect for MMOs. None of my friends want to teach me how to use it and so I'm wondering if OpenGL will open the door to Panda3D?,True
