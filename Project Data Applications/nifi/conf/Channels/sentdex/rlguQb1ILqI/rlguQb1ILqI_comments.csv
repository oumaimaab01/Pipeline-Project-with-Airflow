@Shell1850gb,2018-02-25T15:00:48Z,0,the arrows have referred as greater or less than depending on the direction.,True
@eliecerecology,2017-01-05T08:46:50Z,0,"It gets somehow very slow the node002 after being renamed or keys copied, is it possible that the cause of this is that for every MPI execution, the master node has to login in node002 making the process extremely slow?",True
@eliecerecology,2017-01-03T21:43:09Z,0,"HI, Do we need to make our IP static?",True
@wesleyhur3880,2016-05-02T04:17:19Z,0,I might have missed it but do you use two HDMI cables for both pi's? Like one HDMI for Pi1 and another for Pi2?,True
@TsubasaKato,2015-09-28T03:07:43Z,0,Thank you for making an awesome step-by-step video for setting up master login! It worked flawlessly on my Raspberry Pi 2 Model B x 2.,True
@Ciddyism,2015-05-14T08:42:53Z,1,"I know the | (vertical bar) as ""pipe (symbol)"". >> appends the output of the other cat to the file you wrote at the end name? I don't know a name for that.  To ""not login to every node"": sudo apt-get install pssh controlling all nodes at once by the use of parallel-ssh should be possible now test it with ""parallel-ssh -h machinefile -l pi mkdir new_dir"" from your mpi_test folder (every PI in your machinefile (=all nodes) should have a folder called new_dir in the home folder of user pi) makes maintenance a little easier?!?  I was lazy: I authorized my key on localhost and did scp ~/.ssh/* Pi01:.ssh/. scp ~/.ssh/* Pi02:.ssh/. (Pi01 and Pi02 are my nodes and all nodes have static IPs. Repeat this with all your nodes until all of them have a copy of the key and the authorized_keys! Since you have to update when you get new PIs: write a script and use that. Later you can ssh into new PIs from your master node, add the new Pis to the script and copy all information to all nodes) --> every node can now ssh into the other nodes without a password   I'm installing a cache server for update/install/upgrade with apt-get I have a master with 2 nodes right now and they need some time/block the internet connection/the server are not that fast. --> download once, install n times --> no problems even if I upgrade the net to 5 nodes... (some guys have a cluster with even more nodes. But this is the max number I would by for now. It's just for fun.)  (maybe I missed some things listed above or they are in videos I did not watch)",True
