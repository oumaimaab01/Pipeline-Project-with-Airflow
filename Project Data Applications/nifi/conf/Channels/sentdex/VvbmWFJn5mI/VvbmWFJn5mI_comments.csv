@matthewosborn3093,2018-10-05T15:09:18Z,0,"Hey @sentdex have you thought about using AI to learn PID controllers for quad copters? There's a massive community of fpv racing and Freestyle pilots that spend hours tuning their quads PIDs, imagine the degree of accuracy one could achieve and the time one could save if we replaced a PID controller with some kind of AI? I guess you'd generate training data by analyzing raw input from gyro and accelerometer and seeing how a nicely tuned quad handles it then train the AI on that.. Curious to hear your thoughts if you will or won't do it?",True
