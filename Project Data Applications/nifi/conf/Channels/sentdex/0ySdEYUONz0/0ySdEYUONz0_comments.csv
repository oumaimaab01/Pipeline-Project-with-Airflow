@srivathshanks2793,2016-12-09T06:52:04Z,0,"Hi Sentdex, I have a question instead of installing the packages separately would that be possible for me to work all these things in ipython notebook. Your videos are very helpful. Thanks !!",True
@ronniecheng8892,2016-09-03T01:59:25Z,0,"Hi I use mac, and would like to use IDLE environment for class. I have a problem to use terminal to install packages such as numpy, matplotlib... Are you able to make a video to show how to install it? or can you guide me to solve this problem? (actually terminal states those packages has already in anaconda)",True

@alexcoventry7580,2015-04-01T20:33:09Z,0,"Spoiler alert: This series of talks only glancingly touches on sentiment analysis.  In the end it covers some very crude statistical clean up (truncating price moves over 20 standard deviations seems a bit silly... wouldn't the best opportunities be right there??) and a crude moving-average crossover trading strategy which badly underperforms the market, even when backtested without accounting for trading costs or slippage.  If this was meant as an ad for sentdex, it's a bit strange.  Why provide that fancy data set and then never use it?  Maybe halfway through the author found a trading strategy so profitable that he decided to keep it under his hat? :-)",True
@clockwerkz,2015-03-20T07:23:26Z,1,"Awesome video series.  I'm very interested in learning Pandas for finance purposes.  I'm still a beginner to Python tho, just wrapping up the python lessons in codeacademy.  I'm not a stranger to programming tho.  I've just watched your intro and a bit of the second video.  Do you think your series would be a bit over my head, and if so, what would you recommend in terms of learning python past codeacademy.  Also, I've noticed two books from O'Reilly.. Python for Data Analysis and Python for Finance.. would you recommend either of these books as some additional reading along with your video series?  Thanks!",True
@EricZimerman,2015-03-07T03:09:16Z,0,Thanks man. Is v3.4 still not fully supported by all the dependencies?,True
@sentdex,2015-02-18T15:19:47Z,0,Updated the data set for this series.,True
@trench6118,2014-09-28T00:57:53Z,0,I am just getting into Python - should I just download and use Anaconda instead? Then just check for updates from that one location moving forward?,True

@IsmaelDJIBRIL,2014-06-25T03:47:18Z,0,Nice series! Maybe use Ipython notebook to spare yourself the pain/time of switching windows :-),True

@gcm4312,2014-05-19T03:02:30Z,1,"great vid. I would recommend Python Anaconda, which has all dependencies you mentioned (along with iPython and other great modules). It was the easiest way I found to get Pandas,Matplotlib, etc without headache both in Windows and MacOS.",True
@dfrusdn,2014-05-18T07:46:48Z,0,Nice to know you use pandas :),True
