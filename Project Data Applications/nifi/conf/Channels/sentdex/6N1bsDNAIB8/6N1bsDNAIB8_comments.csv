@BalimaarTheBassFish,2019-09-20T23:05:42Z,0,"One thing I just don't understand about this tutorial series. We started out with:   ""Let's teach our AI about Voidrays! It's important to master one thing at a time so that we know things work before we introduce more complexity!""   Next minute....   From 4 decisions on one unit, we are suddenly expecting our AI to randomly do well with FOURTEEN choices?",True
@tobagheorgheirinel703,2019-01-16T18:58:50Z,0,Nice video mate stil what you think using 2060 that already use tensorflow i think you wil get beter fps whit that i wait your opinion,True
@nezu30,2018-08-06T22:49:41Z,0,Can you use python coding for The Elder Scroll: Skyrim? :D,True
@theoutstander,2018-08-02T22:46:03Z,0,You have to apply alpha manually in opencv. Essentially taking a weighted average of the existing image and the object that you are drawing on it.,True
@ChaOsLeon1,2018-08-02T06:21:13Z,0,You should add to your build_pylon function an exception that you dont build so many pylon at 20 supply. async def build_pyloon(self): ... if self.can_afford(PYLON) and (max_supply - current_supply < 5): ...  [I dont know the real code] but thats how you prevent your bot from spending so much money into unnessesary pylons,True
@turulix7540,2018-08-02T01:05:47Z,1,How many tries did it Take you to get wins against the easy bot about 300 Games still no wins :/  Edit 500games and 1 win *_*,True
@BluEagl,2018-08-01T19:55:52Z,0,"A method of 'brightening' at overlaps I once used: 1. Opencv uses numpy arrays 2. Numpy arrays can be directly added to each other, or values in the array can be incremented 3. For each unit covering a pixel, increment the pixel value or add a prebuilt numpy array there 4. Each unit added to the pixel will increase the byte value (1..2..255, etc) making it 'brighter'.  If you want to use the alpha concept, check out opencv's addWeighted() here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_core/py_image_arithmetics/py_image_arithmetics.html  and here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36921496/how-to-join-png-with-alpha-transparency-in-a-frame-in-realtime#37198079",True
@tormentedbacon4573,2018-08-01T19:35:41Z,0,"ahh, now you break out the towards method after I spent many hours finding an actual position to do the same thing.      lol",True
@architectmind3662,2018-08-01T18:58:01Z,0,"Could you have the scout rove around the known enemy radius, hopefully to prevent it from being a waste?",True
@user-hh4uu9jd9f,2018-08-01T18:19:25Z,0,nice solution!,True
@glorytoarstotzka330,2018-08-01T18:17:42Z,0,yes u  changed intel method but when u will change AMD method,True
@Alex-bj8gu,2018-08-01T16:58:52Z,0,Im sure you have already answered this question. But what plugins do you use in sublime?,True
@ArunKUMAR-wp4sb,2018-08-01T16:51:18Z,0,I use Ubuntu as my operating system. is there any way I can follow using this tutorial and make an AI in Ubuntu. Can anyone tell me how can i do that please?,True
@Xohoo370,2018-08-01T15:49:36Z,1,"Regarding the positioning of buildings I don't think it would be wise to point them allways towards the center.  First you limit the possible places and potentially block your paths.  Second some expansions are orientated differently, so you could end up building all buildings in the mineral line. There are also exceptions, sometimes you want to build shieldbatteries and cannons inside the mineral line. Anyways, really enjoing this series :)",True
@archiatrus1093,2018-08-01T15:35:45Z,2,"Just a thought: all the units types already have IDs. Why not use them as ""grey value""? Of course you need to scale it to 0..255 for human visualization but the network shouldn't care too much? Furthermore, I would then use a two channel image. First channel for your units, second channel for enemy units. That helps with mirror matchups if my idea above us used. And even if not I assume that it maybe helps with learning?!  And questions: why do you use 8 times the radius? I guess you don't use filled circles because of the alpha problem?  Anyway great tutorials. It's time I let go of my c++ bot and finally try Python-sc2 :D",True
@dxamphetamin,2018-08-01T15:34:00Z,3,"could you do a tutorial (maybe the next one; especially if you will do more of these python playing xzy) on how to play a lot of games rather quickly? Like, how to set up a Linux machine (online or local?) without rendering for quick sample gathering?",True
@yarrthepirateify,2018-08-01T15:22:56Z,0,If possible I enjoyed this one more than the last,True
