@CaleMcCollough,2023-09-22T14:39:08Z,1,"I ended up with one 3090 24gb and two 3060 12gb cards. I'm going to upgrade to a dual 3090 with water cooling. If I had the money I would be an H100 or A6000 and I would upgrade my 3060 to a 4060 TI 16GB. You're way better off making a monolith webserver with a 128-core Threadripper or Sapphire Rapids dual CPU with 2TB RAM and six A6000 or H100 with water-cooling than paying for cloud resources. You can spend $millions on something like that. Do you really want to fund the free tier? No. You want to save $millions on your server bill and pocket the money. For most people, this scale doesn't make sense. They would never be able to use that much computer power, but I can chew through it.",True

@varunjain8981,2021-09-20T16:10:30Z,1,"With AWS the moment I start the notebook, it start to charge on hourly basis. Even though we are only writing the code and not using GPU to its capacity. In my case, I take probably 50% to 60% of time to write code. If I am on could I will paying for this time as well. Whereas if I do most of the work on local then I don't pay for it.

@cyan_aura,2020-08-21T06:59:13Z,0,"Nice informative video. I'd like to mention one point in favor of cloud, aws to be specific. If you choose a spot block instance, you can define the duration for which you're going to reserve the machine. The duration can be 1 to 6 hrs. These are quite a bit cheaper than on-demand instances. E.g. a g4dn.2xlarge instance when reserved for 6 hrs. costs you about $0.58 per Hour, while the on-demand instance cost is $0.828 per Hour. If you choose to reserve for a lesser duration, costs are even lower. Google colab is another good alternative where you get access to gpu instances for free. I think the notebook can run uninterrupted for 12 hours max, but that's still a great option.",True

@stetsonb7915,2020-06-09T21:28:13Z,0,"Excuse me if this has already been asked but, I am curious if you have ever talked with other YouTubers (Linus Tech Tips comes to mind specifically) about creating a collaboration video or testing benchmark system for GPU testing with Neural Networks?   I feel like there could be tremendous value for individuals or organizations to be able to compare their compute needs with many possible computer specs. Clearly, the more VRAM and Higher clock speeds will perform better. But finding the marginal cost to marginal output could be helpful and very interesting. While your video makes it clear cloud computing is super great and likely to be the best option for most individuals, for people like me who are really excited about Neural Networks & also enjoy playing games on PC/streaming/video editing, it could prove to be quite valuable in terms of choosing our own upgrade path.",True

I barely use it enough to justify the cost of the GPU at all. Should have stuck with Paperspace. ;) Just the psychological factor of 'paying $2 per hour' on the cloud for something I don't own makes me nervous every time though, and is less convenient than having your own physical machine.  Just the cost of a gaming GPU these days is a little painful for me. Like you say though, it's useful to have something local just to work on and go to cloud when you need. I just won't upgrade my local GPU in the future, if I need an upgrade, cloud it is.",True
