@alextheheck,2020-02-24T13:48:32Z,0,"Little late to the party here and I absolutely love your tutorials. Thank you for putting so much effort into them.  However, I just wanted to point out that, at least in Django >= 3.0 setting default=datetime.now() on your DateTimeField doesn't have the intended effect. That method will get invoked exactly once during migrations and then that default value will get used for all subsequent instances of the model.  They even have a handy warning message the test server prints to console:  (fields.W161) Fixed default value provided.         HINT: It seems you set a fixed date / time / datetime value as default for this field. This may not be what you want. If you want to have the current date as default, use `django.utils.timezone.now`  I don't know whether this is actually new behavior in 3.0 or has always been the case, but basically for anybody trying to follow this tutorial in 2020: Just use django.utils.timezone.now as a callback and you will wind up with a timestamp of the time the Tutorial instance was actually created instead of an invariant default value.",True

@Zackyzic,2019-01-23T17:57:49Z,18,"Can you show us something slightly more advanced such as having persistent database storage or being able to spin up an independent postgres db instance to connect to our django app? Since I started learning about django deployment from these tutorials, I never considered the implications of having an embedded database like sqlite3 which gets loaded into docker containers by default as a part of my project folder. I didn't realise how this was causing a ""data persistence"" issue, where my data kept getting wiped from my app's VM as it shut down and started up again on my hosting platform. I wish I knew more about the pitfalls and precautions we need to know about while deploying an app when we actually try and do a production level deployment for django. Thanks for the tutorial series, btw! Your series covers the basics of django pretty well, but I basically haven't encountered any series yet which can take us through the ""production-ising"" process for a django app, if we want to do it for a legit application.",True
