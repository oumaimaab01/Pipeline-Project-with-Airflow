@VOGTLANDOUTDOORS,2021-08-12T01:29:05Z,0,"LIKED YOUR VIDEO...   FYI:  AF_INET == ""Address Family_ Internet"" == ""Address Family_ipv4""   So AF == ""Address Family""   Indeed sockets (including ""web"" sockets) are challenging as a concept mostly because even the guys who thought up the protocol back in the mid/late 2000's knew what they NEEDED, but could only describe what they needed as ""something BETTER than HTTP"" :-|   THAT begs the question ""WHAT was 'HTTP'"" to them, and WHAT were its WEAKNESSES that even NEEDED to be BETTER?""  :-|   IF ""HTTP"" is a ""PROTOCOL for FORMING and USING a CONNECTION between CODE playing the ROLE of SERVER and code playing the ROLE of CLIENT"", THEN:  - HTTP was BI-DIRECTIONAL, in that information was flowing BOTH directions (FROM Client TO Server as a REQUEST, then FROM Server to CLIENT as a RESPONSE);  - HTTP was SYNCHRONOUS (I'll use this term carefully here); The SERVER COULDN'T send a RESPONSE until it had completely received (and processed) a REQUEST;  - HTTP was HALF-DUPLEX (If the CLIENT was SENDING its request, then the SERVER COULDN'T be sending its response until the connection was ""clear"");   These limitations were QUICKLY recognized in the mid/late 2000's because BANDWIDTH was still LOW throughout much of the world.   SO FAR SO GOOD...   SINCE Humans being have an (amazing) build-in capability to NEGATE things (you could argue this is how we dreamed up the concept of ""God""), then all the top Internet propeller-heads started thinking of a NEW, BETTER protocol that was still bi-directional, but WASN'T synchronous and WASN'T half-duplex.  :-O  ** VOILA ** - they now KNEW what this brave, new protocol needed to be (basically ""NOT HTTP""), but it needed a cool name...  Well, they must've been friends with the guys who dreamed up ""Hadoop"" and every OTHER stupid, NON-self-describing technology name, because ""WEBSOCKET"" didn't make sense to ME back THEN... and it still DOESN'T now either :-|   But we're stuck with it ;-)   WHY they couldn't have simply called it ""HTTP2"" or ""HTTP.next"" or ""HTTPgen2"" or ""HTTPg2""... but that would have made sense, and that's simply goes against the very nature of the entire Internet ;-)   SO a ""WEBSOCKET"" is the name given to both the PROTOCOL and even the actual CONNECTIONS between clients and servers...  ""Let's OPEN a SOCKET"" (equivalent to saying ""Let's open a CONNECTION"") ""Let's SEND a MESSAGE using WEBSOCKET"" (equivalent to saying ""Let's send a message using a PROTOCOL"")   You'd think it's been nearly 30 YEARS since Al Gore ""created the Internet"" ;-)...  ... and we STILL SUCK at both NAMING and EXPLAINING some pretty important concepts.   IMAGINE if MEDICINE was as bad a INTERNET ENGINEERING :-O  IMAGINE if DOCTORS were as bad as INTERNET ENGINEERS :-O  We'd all be dead.

@lindsay5985,2019-02-05T06:20:07Z,0,"@sentdex, how do you find and remember the names of methods and attribute constants like AF_INET when IDLE doesn't prompt you with code hints? Even in Anaconda Spyder,  only a limited and often useless list of methods appears when I define s as a socket and then type ""s. "". Furthermore, connect, which seems pretty basic, is not listed. If I type  ""s.conn"" it tells me that it has nothing - yet when I just ignore the insistance that it doesn't exist and type in ""s.connect(server, port)"" regardless, it works. So how is anyone supposed to know these methods and names? Thanks for another great tutorial :)",True

Because I'm stupid (and stubborn) enough to run P3 on Windows and P2 on my Linux VM and Raspberry Pi, as a beginner, this was a very big help.  About your channel: About a year ago I started to learn some 'easier to grasp' languages/libs. (HTML, CSS, some frameworks, Ruby (RoR) and Python (Django)) (My curiosity also let me stumble upon some C/C++/C#/Java and x_86 assembly as well, just to introduce myself to the differences in syntax. Not to actually start coding in obviously.) Wanted to tell you that your video's are a really nice 'bridge' from the absolute basics to starting to use libraries on your own and starting to tackle small problems on your own. For all the content and information I leeched off your channel you should definately be rewarded. In a couple years I will hopefully graduate and have the financial breathing room to donate to basicly everyone that taught me as much as you did as a token of appreciation. Untill then I hope this message will fulfill that role.  THANKS A LOT BRO",True
