That, or there are the other people that don't even realize things like Numpy aren't written in Python...  Personally I find it... almost a bit insulting the way Python ends up getting treated as if it's the tier one language while the language the code is mostly written is sometimes treated as an afterthought.  E.g. it took a long time for PyTorch to support their C++ interface.  I haven't checked lately, but I'm not sure if Tensorflow ever did add a stable C++ interface... but they had some weird implementation where part of it actually was Python for tracking gradients or something.  And they write all the tutorials for Python users, etc...  I don't know, just rubs me the wrong way.  I think it comes from their corporate design origins in part, where the people writing the library are often separate from the people using it, as opposed to code written to ""scratch an itch"" per se, where it was written by someone that wanted to use it themselves.",True

I assume when NN is learning you just input cat picture and tell it that its cat.  do the different nuerons represent how likely it sees whisker, how likely it sees dog nose, how likely it sees cat nose, how likely it sees cat eyes, how likely it sees dog eyes?  at that point, i imagine we have to code up functions for detecting whiskers, cat & dog noses & eyes. this will involve many if statements. at that point isn't the concept of NN broken? ex: we can't code up every possible if statement to a self driving car; my assumption is that the driving force of NN is that we don't have to code up all these logical ifs - it learns by itself.  i quickly looked thru the code in the videos (maybe a couple minutes thru all 5 currently available videos), its just a bunch of numpy math, that is not too hard to understand. what i fail to understand is the why & what of those nueron values&weights and how in the end it actually teaches & classifes.   i hope my question is clear & you or someone can help clear up my confusion.",True

(I am not japanese.)  https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch  Saito also does all from scratch and uses only numpy and matplotlib, and deals with a broad range of topics such as perceptron, loss functions, mini batches, local minima,  backprop, sgd, adagrad, adam, weight init, ReLU, regularization, dropout, hyperparams, cnn, pooling, optimization in book 1. In his sequel (book 2),he covers nlp,  word2vec, rnn, gated rnn, chatbot, attention, and much more.

@davidanalyst671,2020-04-11T20:28:55Z,0,"If you got this running, it wouldn't be that difficult to do some more advanced stuff like train on MNIST, 0-8, train on MNIST 0-9, and then transfer that learning into the 0-8.  Training is a different job than programming, so there is a LOT of room for ""if you see this"" then ""do this"" information in NN's.  Show how to represent ideas in certain layers, and then manipulate those layers to control accuracy.  GANs are fun, but Im curious what would happen if you trained on MNIST0-8, and MNIST0-9, how the GANs would produce different results.  I did this myself with straight python arrays, and for loops, but my crazy family scrambled my brain and now I can't get backprop to work.  I would like to see how to pull individual values from a tensorflow model so I can experiment and screw around with the NN's but I couldn't find how to do that.  You don't seem like a math-heavy guy, but I would like to see someone try to make a backprop algorithm that trains on two different end results at the same time, so you can control the A convergence of neurons, and B, what layer the concepts separate.  When the concepts separate, somewhere near in or after a convolutional layer, you can make the NN learn faster by making sure one concept receives input, and the other does not.  That would GREATLY increase training speed.",True

It's especially important because I'm wanting to use machine learning methods for the lab I'm working in, but I keep hitting road blocks where I feel like I really don't know what I'm doing (which is probably spurred on by the fact that I have no formal education programming or computer science) or how to troubleshoot certain things when problems arise.
