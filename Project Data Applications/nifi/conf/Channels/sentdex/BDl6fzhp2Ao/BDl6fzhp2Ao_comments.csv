@ramtinnazeryan,2021-04-24T01:27:52Z,0,I think in the previous video some one pointed out the Crtl +C problem. this has to do with the fact that you are in the loop and if you want the algorithm to listen for a specific key try threading. it won't read the command unless it is out of loop.,True

@morthim,2021-04-23T23:42:54Z,0,"in order to get speech to text in a lossy manner, you might want to use the vollume of the voice (aka signal) to break up the signal into sections. then you parse progressions of files as stacks until you get lex matches. so for multi sylable words, you get a miss from the first sylable, and a match during teh seccond. it might be irritating but you also could use dead air of a certain length as punctuation. by punctuation i mean delimiters which force the software to restart. so if you are talking and it hangs, stopping talking will cause it to top trying to fix it, and then also restart. if you do this, then you only need to delete the files as they have been affirmatively lexxed. the multi-sylable thing of importance is to have corections going back in the text to change it. the word ""backward"" could be glossed as 'back word' if it is hasty to finalize, but if you accumulate words into the largest sequence of characters, display the partially analyzed word preemptively, and overwrite the bad word for the 'fuller' version, then you have something more generally correct.  another option would be to use a clap to get attention. keywords cause devices like alexa to send audio clips inappropriately to servers, but if you use excessive vollume which squares the mic's signal, then you allow for a bit more intentionality.  it will be less irritating to have to change pacing a bit, than to have to press the spacebar or control-c   i personally would use one of the locks for the microphone if i was to use a keyboard button for ""record this"". scroll lock, capslock, and num lock all make a light on the keyboard light up and make it so you know when you are recording and when you are not.  depending on how you want to use your audio files, you could potentially take the real text of the transcription as the first part of the file name, and then loop until you have not saved a file under that name before.  ""train a model"" it really depends on if you are going to use a bag of words or not. having the long form files would allow for better semantic scraping for translation and the like, but if you don't need the higher amount of complexity, you might want to transcribe only isolated words. there is more data density if you disambiguate the signal to a standard lexicography, like converting to text. so are you trying to get how intonations change over the course of a sentence? if you aren't trying to get that part of speech converted as another layer of meaning, individual words might be the best.  but if you are trying to get a model you can invert so you have a text to speech bot, or if you want to find encodings for other layers like speaker emotion, or speaker' sense of relationship to audience, then the signal needs to be kept intact.  a project you might want to take on related to this is to shift from ascii and unicode 8 to a unicode with emoji, and to introject emoji into the sentences. you take the wav, get the text, but before saving and spliting, continue working on the text for speaking rate, or checking for interogative tone, or bringing interobang/sarcasm marks into the transcription, or train on tone-based body language. also since human relationships are fairly constant, or seem to be, being able to extract emoji could work like a checksum. perhaps even the emoji could be written without greater language model knowledge.  if you can transcribe performances, instead of just semantic expressions it will become more useful and general. but it really depends on what you want to do with it.",True
