@jennycotan7080,2023-12-04T12:42:37Z,0,Interesting!,True
@haianhtran5798,2023-11-08T10:04:20Z,0,"What is the value of bias_output of 3rd pair? rounding error -_- . For example: x = 0.5, y = {0, -0.01, ... , -0.04 }",True
@marvinlanger1155,2023-08-22T14:31:50Z,1,This is a great visualization! I can see the universal approximation theorem here and the activation function (ReLu?) that contributes to the fit of Ã½ to y. I am having trouble with the values in the visualization as they are not labeled. Are the values on the lines the parameters and the values below the nodes the calculated activation values/gradients(?) used to backpropate? Can someone confirm this or correct me?,True
@varunlw,2023-08-22T04:50:27Z,1,"great work, nice way to explain !",True
@sekhardhana3453,2023-05-06T16:59:32Z,1,Awesome ðŸŽ‰,True
@sampathkovvali6255,2023-01-11T07:03:30Z,1,This show's the capablity of neural networks which can fit almost any complex data without much human hand crafting like other algorithms. The best invention of Human Kind.,True
@nuckm,2022-10-21T16:48:37Z,9,"Dude if we could have an animation like this for every mathematical, statistical, or deep learning related construct, things like einsum too, I believe we could have even script kiddies contributing to the field. It's all about building the right mental model, the visualization of these procedures, the same way we learned to add numbers on paper in elementary school not by thinking but visually, and this video does just that for a basic part of DL. Need more of it, a lot more.",True
@nikilragav,2022-08-13T23:10:23Z,2,"I was kind of confused what was happening at first, but towards the middle of fitting the sine function I had an ah hah moment. Still didn't fully understand how bias on the neuron affected the position but never the less very very cool. NN as a function approximator makes visual sense now to me vs generic amorphous sense",True
@yungwarlock,2022-07-15T17:14:44Z,1,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat,True
@Jalalx,2022-04-10T16:44:41Z,2,For the first time in my life I watched a video without sound and got a goosebumps!,True
@erdemkkoc9678,2022-04-02T16:04:22Z,1,Am i the only one who doesnâ€˜t hear anything,True
@rustyanvil51,2022-03-30T06:51:43Z,1,A picture really is worth a thousand words...,True
@jasonhinson951,2022-03-28T15:36:24Z,12,Amazing! simply the best animation for understanding weights and biases! Can you make this animation available with some knobs to play with? Not sure if manim can be embedded in a flask web app but tweaking knobs can really help build intuitive understanding.,True
@CharlesVanNoland,2022-03-25T02:40:26Z,2,Just like how they were talking about how (ReLU) networks are doing piecewise linear interpolation on Machine Learning Street Talk #69 with Thomas Lux last week!,True
@rgel3762,2022-03-23T23:08:07Z,2,What about all the inner connections that you display at the end of the video? Are the weights of them 0?,True
@JamesTJoseph,2022-03-22T13:27:53Z,3,Can you make a series on manim?,True
@user-xs9ey2rd5h,2022-03-22T10:34:55Z,2,"Is this gradient descent, does gradient descent not work on all weights at the same time?",True
@mj-lc9db,2022-03-21T21:07:52Z,1,Amazing!!!!,True
@_RMSG_,2022-03-21T20:54:23Z,8,May want to add a note about there being no sound,True
@user-ph8fd4do1b,2022-03-21T20:28:56Z,1,what is the activation function used? and this example shows the initialization or derivative or what exactly?? not clear,True
@thedoctor5036,2022-03-21T19:13:41Z,3,No Sound ?,True
@meguellatiyounes8659,2022-03-21T16:35:54Z,1,beautifull aproach  for weight intialization to similar problems.,True

@_jelle,2022-03-21T14:42:48Z,2,Very nice & illustrative animation,True
@lakeguy65616,2022-03-21T14:37:24Z,4,does this video have sound?,True
@_xentropy,2022-03-21T14:19:30Z,1,I have a similar animation:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E__DGwyjDqk,True
@yangmin1036,2021-04-30T20:25:11Z,2,Amazing! thanks for clarifying everything!,True
@DJ95,2021-01-29T17:14:13Z,25,"I was reading this chapter in the book and I was like ""whaaaaaat is happening here maaan, am I really this dumb? "" and then after seeing this animation I had the ""ahaaaaa"" moment, amazing!",True
@splch,2020-09-03T15:56:13Z,49,this is the most impressive video on youtube,True
