@Champo0,2018-01-18T22:05:23Z,0,"Thank you for all thees tutorials sentdex! These help soooo much! :)  I got a question though, I saw the following code: self.mycheckbox.toggled[bool].connect(self.mytextbox.setDisabled)  It does what you might expect: disabling the text-input-box.  Now I wanted to try to do something if the checkbox is unchecked and checked again by doing the following: self.mycheckbox.toggled[1].connect(self.do_something) But it lead to invalid syntax.   I thought it was a short form to call functions for the on/off state but I guess I still don't quite understand how the type within the squarebrackets works and how to use it.  Can anybody please shine some light on that problem of mine?",True
