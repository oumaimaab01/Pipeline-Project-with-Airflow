For starters, my computer runs on Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1. I've downloaded the latest version of Python that included pip (3.6.1) and the Pygame module (the latest version: pygame-1.9.3) and moved it to the site-packages folder. I tried installing the module but I ran into numerous difficulties. In one of my attempts, I downloaded what I'm pretty sure was the right install wheel (pygame-1.9.3-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl). When I attempted the method described in this video, I get the following message upon entering the command prompts:   ""The system cannot find the path specified.""   The installation method you described sounds so simple, but I just can't get it to work no matter how many times I tried with the command prompt or the Python interpreter.

I'm using Win10, Python3.5.1 (64-bit) and I wanted to install scipy which failed when trying to install it ""the normal way"" i.e. in cmd 'pip install scipy'. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know of the solution in my case if anyone's having the same issue.  Here's what I did: 1) I followed the instructions:       a) Downloaded the wheel      b) Opened the download directory,      c) Opened cmd with that directory and tried installing as instructed  This resulted in an error ""C:/*bliiblaabluu* is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable progrem or batch file""   2) I put the target directory in quotation marks      - got an error ""ERROR: unknown command 'pip' ""  3) I opened a new cmd as administrator and navigated to the downloads file. I removed the target directory from the line, so basically while in the download directory I just wrote:      ' pip3.5 install ""scipy-0.17.0-cp35-none-win.amd64.whl"" '  This worked...
