I have a few vids of Roebling, Sebring, and the FIRM on my channel. Was on s2ki as nissanfanatic for a few years until I sold mine.  Also, I found quite a bit of differential pressure approximately 16.5"" back from the front of the hood using a manometer (Thats how I decided where to place my hood vent). It measured right around 0.06lb/in^2 at 60mph, which is the maximum dynamic pressure of air.

But my new year's resolution is to start web-design and web-development business and change that fact about myself. My goal is to get paid for using all the information I have amassed over these last two years and this does not even begin to mention my college experience. But hopefully this will be a productive year for me and hopefully, I can learn a lot from your channel. The right way this time.  Happy Holidays to you man.",True

@tsukikage,2017-05-23T03:27:16Z,1,"Just watched all your Q&A videos to make sure this question wasn't already answered. Long story short, I've explored many different fields (math, linguistics, computer science, accounting, etc.) to try to find something that I actually felt confident enough in to pursue as a career, and in all of these fields I did very well at the *very* beginning, but once I moved on to meatier material I felt that I either didn't have the problem solving skills or the efficiency compared to my peers to actually succeed in that field. An assignment that was supposed to take me 5-10 hours would take me 20.  My question is this: do you have any recommendations for finding out in the earlier stages of learning to program if you actually have the proper intellect it takes to make a career out of it?  One other question: I'm somewhat of a beginner to both Python and programming, and one of my goals is to start developing useful apps (not games) for Android (and perhaps also iOS). I know it's possible to develop Android apps using Python, but do you happen to know of any good resources for people who are completely new to developing apps (or really anything with a GUI)?",True

In the end, when it comes to the more practical part, you refer mostly to some services you use (domain hoster, Amazon web services for heavy calculations, etc.). I think during the time some new services come and maybe you switch. Could you list some (or all) of them you find useful for your business and also explain why?  Thanks Sniger   PS: In case my question is unclear, because of poor writing: In your raspi supercomputer tutorial you told us that it's more a fun project to learn how MPI works but you would not recommend to build a supercomputer of raspis for heavy calculations. Instead you would prefer to buy a some GPU's because of more FLOPS. In one of your Q&A's you told us that you use Amazon web services for calculations.
