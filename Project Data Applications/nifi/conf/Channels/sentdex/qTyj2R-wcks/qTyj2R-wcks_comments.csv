@JuggernautProducts,2019-07-10T19:01:30Z,0,"Hey, so you definitely have a lot more experience with this than I do. When using your methods to make Vader Sentiment more accurate along with Text Blob while using the sample texts provided, I keep running into major accuracy issues. For example,  on the negative text file, both Vader and Text Blob end up classifying the text as roughly 50/50 positive and negative, which is no better than flipping a coin. Do you know why this might be?",True
@TheBluCypher,2019-02-12T21:51:53Z,0,"using your final example with textblob, the number of negative samples textblob identifies is only 2072 out of a total of 5332. If we use the negative.txt file to actually test for positive sentiment instead, we get 2345 which is higher than negative. So, textblob is actually saying that our negative sentiment file contains MORE positive sentiment than negative sentiment lol, which is entirely wrong for our case. Is there a better way of representing negative sentiment? Because if we were to go in blind not knowing our dataset contains negative sentiment, we would actually end up with polarity leaning towards the positive end. (first time doing sentiment analysis so trying to wrap my head around this aha)",True

@CristiNeagu,2018-02-27T18:31:18Z,7,"Also, it's obvious TextBlob is ""slightly better"", since your condition for counting a sentence as valid is that it should have (for positive accuracy) a polarity greater or equal to 0.0001. It's then obvious that any sentence that passes that test will have a polarity greater than 0. You are counting them twice. You will always get 100% accuracy.",True
