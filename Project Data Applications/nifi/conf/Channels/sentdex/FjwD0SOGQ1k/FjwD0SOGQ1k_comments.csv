@finfan7,2019-04-24T02:23:11Z,2,"I hope you don't mind if I criticize but after learning a bit of tkinter using various sources, including your videos and some others, I'd really like to suggest some more explanation rather than a design goal.  (i.e. look at the library first, then look at using it.)  This wasn't so much an intro to the library as a read-aloud as you code through your version of hello_world with kivy.  You don't have to do a deep dive in video one but starting with a look at what some of the most common and useful parts of the library are would be very helpful.  (e.g. If this were tkinter since I don't know Kivy, a look at the common widgets, like Button, Label, Entry, etc. and the bare-bones basics of the grid layout manager) I'd also have liked to hear a moment or two, just a few asides, saying things like 'I just wrote self.add_widget.  We'll look more in depth later at GridLayout and go into more detail about how it handles that call, but the gist of it is that it segments the screen into a grid, like a spreadsheet, and then tries to add the item to the containing class by pushing it toward the upper left but with each item in its own cell.'  Even little clues can go a long way toward making the video more of a teaching video than a say-what-you-type code-along.",True
