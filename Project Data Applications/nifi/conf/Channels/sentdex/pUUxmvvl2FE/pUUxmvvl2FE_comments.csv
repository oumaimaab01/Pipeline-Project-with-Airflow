@rachelooh5750,2014-09-19T06:35:47Z,0,"Hi, I think your videos are great. So far, they are the best I've found on getting/analyzing twitter with Python.  Question: Is it possible to use the Sentdex API to get the sentiment of a specific twitter id's network? Say you have a twitter ID, and you want to look at the followers, however many nodes out, for specific keywords and look at sentiment/frequency of mentions. I've been looking for a way to do this in real-time, but every example I've found is for analyzing general tweets, not tweets from a twitter id's graph. I am pretty new to python, so any help would be much appreciated. If you explain this in another tutorial, I'd appreciate a link. I built a little python script that will store the list of a twitter user however many nodes out, but what I'd really like to do is access that list from a JSON object and run it through real-time sentiment analysis. I am not so much interested in storing exactly what people are saying (and storing tweets is against the rules anyway), but I'd like to store the output of the analysis, including the twitter ids of the graph that were most positive/most frequent for specific keywords.
