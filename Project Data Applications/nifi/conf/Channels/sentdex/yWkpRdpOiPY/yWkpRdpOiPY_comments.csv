@jeremiahjohnson6052,2021-08-19T03:52:18Z,1,"Nicely done, Sentdex. One of the issues with using price data that generally increases is that the model can learn to always guess ""buy"" and be around 55-56% correct due to the innate bias of the data. I.e. 55-56% of the time the price is increasing. So for the sake of evaluating an investment model, you need to first establish the percent of days where the price is increasing, and set that as your base. Any improvement above that is better than just buying and ""hodling"". OR you can prune your data by training it on an equal amount of buy/sell periods. With an LSTM, though, this would be a bit more tricky. This can work for a Transformer or Conv-based model.",True

You should normalize the train and validation with the same exact parameters and not individually. Suppose for one of the columns the numbers are in the range of 0 to 100 while the same column in validation has numbers in the range 0 to 10, this creates a mismatch of what the model thinks of the normalized values  between train and validation. I know all the columns are percent changes and hence in theory between -100 to 100, but the validation data might happen to be in a tighter range (possible slightly) than the training data.",True
