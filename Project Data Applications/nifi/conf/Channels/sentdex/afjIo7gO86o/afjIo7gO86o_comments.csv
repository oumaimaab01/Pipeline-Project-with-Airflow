@nadyamoscow2461,2021-10-06T01:37:58Z,1,"Many thanks for the fantastic course. I`m not sure but it feels like instead of catching the keys in dict by hand you could do:  labels = [abbv_dict[c] if c in abbv_dict else c for c in min_wage_corr.columns] bad = [s for s in labels if len(s) > 2] print(labels, bad, sep = '\n')   At least it worked for me (the basic data file has changed by now so there`s no FLSA ) #['AK', 'AR', 'CA', 'CO', 'CT', 'DE', 'DC', 'Guam', 'HI', 'ID', 'IN', 'KY', 'ME', 'MD', 'MA', 'MI', 'MN', 'NE', 'NV', 'NH', 'NJ', 'NM', 'NY', 'NC', 'ND', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'PA', 'RI', 'SD', 'UT', 'VT', 'WA', 'WV', 'WI', 'WY'] #['Guam']   bad = {'Guam':'GU', 'AK': 'blue'} #  for instance there are more values  labels = [ labels[i] if labels[i] not in bad else bad[labels[i]]  for i in range(len(labels)) ] print(labels)  #['blue', 'AR', 'CA', 'CO', 'CT', 'DE', 'DC', 'GU', 'HI', 'ID', 'IN', 'KY', 'ME', 'MD', 'MA', 'MI', 'MN', 'NE', 'NV', 'NH', 'NJ', 'NM', 'NY', 'NC', 'ND', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'PA', 'RI', 'SD', 'UT', 'VT', 'WA', 'WV', 'WI', 'WY']",True
