@sbcinema2363,2020-04-11T21:06:28Z,0,"India is waking up technologically!? LOL, bad analysis there. Indians already have a big prevalence in the sciences, engineering, and medical fields. The cliche of the Indian engineer can be seen in the 80's with movies like Short Circuit, with Fischer Stevens playing an Indian inventor of the Johnny 5 robot!  The main reason is twofold:     1) India had a huge population growth rate of ~2% in the 1980-2000 period, that resulted in about 500 million children that will reach adulthood around now, a portion of which are interested in python stuff. That's 1.5x the ENTIRE population of the US! That's the number young adults in India. 1% of that is 500k viewers.    2) English is a big part India languages. Not so in China. If you make a Chinese translated version of your videos, you should see a huge rise in viewrship from there. There is a reason why you see some YouTube reaction channels by non-Indian people cater entirely to watching and reacting to India-centric news and entertainment. The sheer number of views they get are huge!",True

However, to me, it occurs that since pythonprogramming.net is just a site that directs to YouTube anyway, it make more sense to directly subscribe to YouTube channel.   one way that could improve the viewership and reduce bounce rates from pythonprogramming.net is that you have better video recommendations.   For instance, if a user searches ""how to open and read file?""; that should display all the relevant content you have over the site across all the playlists/ courses.

I have huge respect for you and I am taking this opportunity to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your python plays GTA V series served as a huge inspiration for me. I used your concept to make a mini self driving car prototype using jetson nano. It is a car that can drive on its own in a track using conv nets. This project wouldn't have been possible without you and I owe you a lot. I have even made sure to mention your name in my project report. I thank you once again. Your content is a treasure trove for anyone who is hoping to enter into AI and ML. Everyone deserves to receive your knowledge and I will make sure to become a channel member once I start earning.....  I would be very happy if you took a moment to check out the video of my project.
