Essentially the shape errors are caused because matrix multiplication is NON commutative. whereas with normal scalar values x*y = y*x, with matrices M0*M1 != M1*M0. the columns in the first matrix need to be the same number of rums in the second matrix to be able to multiply them together.

@azazel-776,2023-11-01T04:18:27Z,0,"Bias is an additional parameter associated with each neuron in the neural network. It serves as an offset or baseline value that helps neurons activate (produce output) even when the input values are all zero. In simple terms, think of bias as a measure of how easy it is for a neuron to activate or fire. It allows a neuron to be responsive to inputs even if they are not very large. Without bias, the neuron might not activate unless the inputs are significantly large. The bias term adds flexibility to the model. It helps the neural network account for situations where certain inputs might not be as informative but still play a role in making a prediction.",True
@azazel-776,2023-11-01T04:17:39Z,0,"Larger Weights: A larger weight means that the associated input feature has a stronger influence on the neuron's output.

@sadrabakhshandeh1835,2021-06-09T14:20:21Z,1,"hello I just wanted to point out, you obviously don't know yourself what weights and biases are. You are saying that they are things that let us adjust our program which is true but it's not the logical reason behind them. imagine a program for recognizing cats and dogs. imagine there is a neuron in one of the hidden layers which detects snouts. the more this neuron gets active the more picture is likely to be a dog and the less the picture is likely to be a cat. how the computer understands this is by weights. In our example the weight of our snout neuron should be positive toward dog (make it more likely) and it should be negative toward cat (make it less likely) and the number is just how important it is. like snout is a big clue in recognizing the picture as a dog so its weight should be pretty high. biases are just checking if its number is worthy to be called a clue. Like when you set a -1 bias it means that if it's not at least one just ignore it (it doesn't matter that much) or the other way when you set a +2 bias it means that if it's not less than -2 it's something worth taking note of(even if it is a blur image). anyway thanks for the tutorial really helpful in code . long time fan",True

@christophebeaulieu4916,2020-07-26T16:14:51Z,0,"I think a good way to see why we need a biais instead of just always modifying the weight, is when we need a certain value but either the input or the weight is 00.  If either is null, there would be no output. Therefore, the biais comes in and saves the day.  What made me understand this is when I was watching an AI train to ""guess"" whether the value would be above or below a function (ax + b). If b was not null, the NN wouldn't ever be able to guess what any null value would actually be, as it would always guess the same thing, regardless of the ""input""",True

Imagine a robot with a camera stuck on its head was taking pictures in a completely white room and it processes what it sees as follows,  white pixels = 0 coloured pixels = 1  This gives us our input values.  Now we want to weight or ""tune""  this neural network, (basically we want the computer to get excited when it sees anything other than white and give us a strong signal) so we add a weight value of 10.   So this would mean if it sees,    white our input signal will be 0    And any other color will give us: 100  Per pixel.  And we can add a bias of 2 just for good measure lol   Now imagine the robot and camera are bolted to the floor and across the room animals appear exactly 6 feet away and they sit facing the camera and dont move...  Using this neural network, the robot would see a big animal as a huge number and a small animal as a tiny number.

However it is only correct for matrix * vector. It does not work otherwise.  Had he done (input, weight). The input wouldn't be a vector anymore. it would be a: 1x4 matrix multiply with 3*4 matrix, so he would need to transpose the weight. it would be (input, weight.T).

Because of that program is seeing that as tuple that represents dimensions of matrix/vector. Vector size is (4,1) and matrix size is (4,3). That means that every row has 4 columns in both vector and every row (vector) in matrix. In math if you want to multiply them, they must have same number of vector dimension, in this example, they both have 4. If you would change dimension than it would be like you have (4,1) and (3,4), because they don't have both first number 4, it would mean that rows in matrix have only 3 columns (numbers), so one is missing, because of that program couldn't calculate that because it doesn't have all variables.",True

@leonshamsschaal,2020-04-24T18:35:54Z,0,"@sentdex The np.dot function takes about 50 microseconds to complete on my machine but a slightly modified version of your for loop method is 2x as fast and can complete the same operation in only 25 microseconds. It turns out that adding biases to the np.array of layer outputs takes longer than just adding each bias to the neuron output before you append because you end up running two for loops so this dot function would be a lot more efficient. Here is the function:  def dot(iterator, multiplier, biases, layer_outputs=[]):     for neuron_bias, neuron_weights in zip(biases, weights):         neuron_output = 0         for neuron_inputs, input_weights in zip(inputs, neuron_weights):             neuron_output += neuron_inputs*input_weights         layer_outputs.append(neuron_output+neuron_bias)     return np.array(layer_outputs)     layer_outputs = dot(weights, inputs, biases)",True
@fiNitEarth,2020-04-24T18:33:27Z,0,"Hey, I've got a question, I hope you guys can help me understand this a little bit better.  So the neural networks we've seen in this series to this point always have a neuron, which takes an input, to determine which number they will pass to the neuron. It''s always directly proportional to the number of the previous neuron. So as I understand it, if there's a huge number as an input, they will either output a very huge number to the next neuron or a very small one. So if the input is, say 0, they will always pass zero (plus the bias obviously).  And here comes my question: BUT what if 0 was the ""sweet spot""? For example if you have temperature as an input and you want to output, say rather the temperature is comfortable, you would want to have a maximum in your function around 0, and not at infinity. Is there a method to fix this problem? or am i missing something?   An answer would  be much appreciated, i hope you get what i wanted to say.!",True

@tanmaygoel9435,2020-04-24T15:51:51Z,0,This is the way to teach. I'm sure this series will take my scattered knowledge about neural networks and make it into an actually useful skill.

@classicrockman90,2020-04-24T15:40:56Z,0,The weights and biases correspond to the slope (m) and offset (b) in the equation of a line. This simple equation allows faster computation and differentiation (in the training step) than if you had more complex quadratic or higher order polynomial equations for each neuron. The goal is to build up a network of many simple functions and not a few very complex functions.,True

@onrizz,2020-04-24T15:35:26Z,0,"what I understood about dotproducts and matrix is,  dot product of inputs (which is of size ->  [4,1]) and weights (which is of size -> [3,4]) is just like ""matrix multiplication"" but instead the goal is to get scalar output.   In matrix multiplication, when we multiply two matrices m1[4rows, 4colomns] and m2[4rows, 3colomns]. we have to have same no. of colomns from m1 and same no. of rows from m2. and the output we get is => m3[4,3] which is 4rows from m1 and 3colomns from m2. If you get what im trying to say.  so, when doing dotproduct (weights, inputs ) if we take that in terms of size we have weights(3,4).inputs (4,1) =>output (3,1) which is quite scalars in a vectors.  but when doing the reverse i.e dotproduct(inputs,weights) => inputs(4,1).weights(3,4) =>output (4,3) which is not sclars but vectors instead.   *Question* Is this correct? and Am I on the right track?   and sorry for my bad english explaination. Thanks for the series!",True

For Example, y = x1 * w1 + x2 * w2 + b   x1, x2 => Inputs w1, w2 => Weights b => Biases   w1 => Denotes the contribution of x1 to the output w2 => Denotes the contribution of x2 to the output b => Acts as an offset...   This is just a Linear Equation, when activation functions are applied  => Non Linearity is introduced   Why we apply activation functions,  Every data can't be just explained by a Linear equation, so we apply activation functions to make them non linear.",True

Strictly speaking, wouldn't the dot product only work if inputs is an n-by-m matrix (4x1 in this case), where m is the number of samples, as opposed to what's shown here? Looks like NumPy is smart enough to perform the dot product to a rank 1 vector even when the shape mismatches.",True
