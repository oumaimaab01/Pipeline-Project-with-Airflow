@standinginthelimelight,2021-09-03T00:55:40Z,1,"Hi, if you somehow didn't understand the tutorial, read this instead of sending toxic comments. A NamError is something that occurs if python doesn't see where you defined your variable. For example, say your mom said to add a mango to a fruits list. What will you say? Logically, we'd make a new list but python isn't like this. You NEED to tell python what the value of x even is. Example:  X = 1 Y = 2  print(X + Y)  Since you told python the values of x and y, it won't return an error! It's that simple!",True
