@tayfun11100,2018-12-23T08:26:07Z,0,"Thank you for all this great tutorials. I want to developt a code and visiulation for atomic structure. For example a H2O structure, two H and one O. I watched this tutorial and create some spherical models for H and O but its aspect ratio is not 1/1. For example when matplotlib draw a spherical H atom actually H is not spherical because of aspect ratio is not 1. How can i solve this problem? Or my general question is : Matplotlib is good for my job or i should try another modules? Actually i want to create a new modules for atomic structure. Thanks again...",True
