I wanted to ask whether You have the dataset available with You right now? If so, I would be very grateful if You could share it with me via a Link from which I may download it.  The reason I am asking you is because I have downloaded the dataset online but It is in .MHD and .RAW format while the dataset You are using in your video is in .DCM format and I haven't found anyway regarding how to convert it from MHD to DCM. Therefore I am requesting your help, hoping to hear from you soon. thank in advance....................",True

@mkoller,2017-08-04T06:54:27Z,0,"Harrison, I'm totally lost in this tutorial. You said we could use the virtual environment on Kaggle. I found the Data Science Bowl comp and created a new Python notebook but I don't see where to enter code. My options are Notebook, Code, Data, Comments, Log, Versions, Options and off to the right, Fork Notebook and Edit Notebook.   When I press Edit Notebook, I see the input files but the space around notebook is blank and just has this spinning wheel forever like something is trying to load. Maybe something wrong with the website? I did try pressing fork notebook and got a 502 error, so maybe the site is just acting up. Not very familiar with Jupyter Notebook. Man, times like these, you really appreciate how simplistic IDLE is.",True
