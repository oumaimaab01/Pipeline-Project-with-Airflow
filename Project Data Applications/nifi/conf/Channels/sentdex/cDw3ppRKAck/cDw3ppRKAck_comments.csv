@kudoamv,2017-08-05T16:48:23Z,0,"Sorry master but I don't understand this- When I tried this  -  anotherstring = ""google"" counts2 = Counter(anotherstring) z = str(counts2.elements()) print(z)  I get the output - <itertools.chain object at 0x00000268AEAACDA0>  Instead of a sorted string , but if I use list instead I get unsorted list - ['g', 'g', 'o', 'o', 'l', 'e'] which is unsorted. So I don't understand why it is sorting numbers but not alphabets ?  Thanks In Advance !",True
