@erenparladi5950,2021-09-23T19:59:52Z,0,"Thanks so much for the video bro! It saves my bunch of time. The hardest part for me was reloading the apache. I get something like syntax error on mysite.conf file. I handled it by deleting red blank lines in that config file and after that using sudo a2enmod wsgi command. Then, the website was worked on server but this time, there was some other problem about static files. Respectively, 'chgrp -R www-data /blog/media/' and 'chmod -R g+w  /blog/media/' commands worked for my own project. By the way ,these previous commands are about writing and some other permissions. After that, the only problem was image loading. I mean , images was display on dev. tool but on the page that field was blank.  I solved it by editing some lines in settings.py and urls.py files. It was tough struggle but it is worth all for it :)",True
