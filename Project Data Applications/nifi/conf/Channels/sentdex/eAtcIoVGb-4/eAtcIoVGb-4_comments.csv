@strezz123,2014-08-06T18:43:13Z,0,"Thank you for excellent tutorial videos! I really enjoy watching these.  I have an issue with pyplot and would appreciate any feedback on what I might be doing wrong.  In my graphs there is a straight line from the start point to the end point for each data set (i.e. open, high, low, close). There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with my data, and I used exactly the same calls to pyplot as in the video. What am I doing wrong?",True
