@fredyharter6293,2015-04-06T11:01:16Z,0,Hello Harrison! I am looking at the code of this series at the page http://pythonprogramming.net/advanced-matplotlib-graphing-charting-tutorial/ and more specifically to this line  print str(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(int(time.time())).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))  Which I am trying to decompose. Playing on the shell I have understood that we take the integer part (so until the Second precision) of the current time and transform it to a string formatted YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.  But why do we use str() function if we can invoke strftime() directly to the datetime.datetime class?,True

@lespaulandtheboys,2014-01-10T14:51:25Z,0,"Hi, I have a question related to plotting. Often in Matplotlib, plotted data appears to be normalised. As in, the y axis is set to zero at your first datapoint and the data proceeds from the origin. I can't find anywhere to force the 'de-normalisation' on the y axis in this way. Do you know how to do this? I noticed that you were frustrated about something similar in a later video and thought you could help. These series have been immensely helpful, thank you very much.",True
