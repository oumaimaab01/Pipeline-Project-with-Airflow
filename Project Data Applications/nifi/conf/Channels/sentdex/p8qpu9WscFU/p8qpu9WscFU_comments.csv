You should explain all the contents of a typical webpage , e.g the navigation bar. etc.  People are supposed to be creating their own websites not just copy pasting your code.

Yesterday after the release of the 3rd tutorial, I decided I wanted to get a jump on things (too impatient to wait for today) and created a ""styles"" directory within the personal directory with the css for my personal page. I received no errors but the styles did not apply.  I created an exact copy of the header page outside of the django framework (minus the Jinja logic) with an exact copy of the style sheet that i used in my ""styles"" dir and everything worked perfectly.  Today I have the same problem. I am not getting any errors (""stylesheet not found"" etc) but the styles will no apply to the ""header"".  I checked StackOverflow for answers. The only thing I could find that worked for anyone was to go to ""encoding"" in Notepad++ and click ""convert to UTF-8"" then select ""UTF-8"" again. This did not work for me.  If you have any idea what this problem may be please let me know. I want to follow along but I am at a loss here ):",True
