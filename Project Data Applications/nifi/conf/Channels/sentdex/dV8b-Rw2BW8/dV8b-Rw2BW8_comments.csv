@Knight11692,2019-07-17T13:52:10Z,0,Although you have less cords and higher resolution than the CV1 to me the CV1 overall is a better VR experience. The resolution is higher on the S but I can hardly notice the difference unless I'm really looking. Unlike the S I can use the CV1 with the lights off if I wanted. The refresh rate is noticeable to me when coming down from the 90hrtz Rift CV1 to the 80hrtz Rift S when playing games like Robo Recall.,True

@TechedOff,2019-07-06T22:24:10Z,0,Solid review. Nicely done! Only thing you didn't touch on was the IPD. Yours must be in their recommended range because many have also complained that the ideal IPD range of this headset is far narrower than CV1. I guess even Palmer Luckey wrote about it. Thanks!,True

@EG-O,2019-06-06T03:16:51Z,0,"I bought it at best buy and tried it. Didnt like it honestly returned it 4 days after giving it a shot. Tracking sucked really bad, and the ring on the top of the controller always makes me hit myself in the face. Playing onward n military sims are horrible for tracking. And picking up items feels like a delay, and the sound is so bad. I prefer the original rift honestly  Pros: ‚Ä¢ no sensor easy setup just plug and play no need to set up guardian all the time. ‚Ä¢ lenses is pretty good Cons: ‚Ä¢ bad tracking  ‚Ä¢ really blurry in games, ipd adjustments is horrible ‚Ä¢ headstrap needs more adjustments ‚Ä¢ sound is horrible no bass either and really low ‚Ä¢ lost of tracking if too close to your face, so goodluck playing onward and other sims  ‚Ä¢ delays in picking up items.

@Vakrul,2019-06-04T10:15:11Z,2,"I've had the original Rift for a while and it's super great, but dedicating 4 USB slots for it, having the sensors set up and not have the office look like an ungodly mess, it's just not worth having it ready to play whenever. I usually just end up taking it out if I REALLY crave VR stuff.   So it's a no-brainer to me to get the Rift S, and I'm super hyped for mine to arrive. Unfortunately I've gotta wait until late June-ish since it's out of stock where I ordered it.   Was tempted to get the Rift Quest but the battery limit really put me off.

The screen door effect is gone as lcds have minimal space between pixels unlike oled that has a ton of space between pixels.  My only issue is the decrease in black levels and the refresh rate decrease. However, I would still consider it an upgrade.
