@waynefilkins8394,2019-06-30T19:08:52Z,2,"By the way, don't do the quantopian contest it's a 100% scam.  I just found it a couple days ago and was researching it, and found a forum post on their site where a guy was talking about them ripping him off and they closed the thread.  I was somehow able to comment and I asked some questions and apparently they were the wrong questions as I was IP banned within an hour.  They said it was because of my ""tone"" but I just asked some questions about the contest...there was no negative tone.  I made another account on separate IP just saying what happened and they banned that one lmao if you ask them something they don't want to answer, they ban you and they always say it's because of your ""tone"".  That site is extremely shady and i'm pretty sure they can see your algorithm and they are just using it to farm ideas.  There are a few shady articles about ""students trading from dorm"" etc. talking up quantopian saying it actually invested all this money in college kids...it sounds like those clickbait scams ""local college kids make millions blah blah"".  Other than that I have never heard of a person actually winning any of the contests.  They also say your intellectual property is yours until you sign some agreement, but there's nothing stopping them from seeing your code when you submit it into the contest.
