@101graffhead,2022-07-31T18:23:42Z,0,"adding a value to a buffered channel beyond its capacity results in a panic but for some reason to recover from that panic i cannot use recover, does anyone know about it? But i can use select to avoid panicking. edit: nvm apparently deadlock is not considered usual panic and is one of the errors that are not recoverable, i haven't tried it but apparently nil pointer dereference is also unrecoverable.",True

@anushkajm3865,2019-06-24T18:19:09Z,29,I would refrain from having  `defer wg.Done()` inside cleanup() as I can use cleanup() from other methods which may or maynot use go routines. In that case the wait group counter wont be correctly synced.For example : if a panic occurs in a function call which doesn't add to waitGroup the cleanup will try and decrement the waitgroup. which is not actually required. - Let me know what you think of this case,True

@zelllers,2018-04-09T18:52:13Z,1,"defer's overhead in go is not insignificant, however for small projects it's probaby not something to trip yourself up over.    This guy has benchmarked it and wrote about it: https://medium.com/i0exception/runtime-overhead-of-using-defer-in-go-7140d5c40e32",True

@draakisback,2017-11-12T02:05:00Z,9,You could defer wg.Done in the main func since wg is globally defined.  Though actually that would probably error out.  Generally when you want to defer multiple functions the way to do it is to build a closure and just defer them in that.  Something like defer func () { wg.Done() cleanup()}() would work in this case.  You can embed wg.Done in cleanup as well since it runs when the go-routines panic.,True

My audio isn't muted or something, it's specificly these video's. -edit- after searching for the last video with sound, I couldn't find any other than the video about the S2000 MSR. Some time ago I said the same thing, but then I had sound until about video's in the GTA series. This is so weird.",True
