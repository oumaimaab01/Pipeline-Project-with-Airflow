@boot_menu3784,2017-05-21T14:47:57Z,5,Hi @sentdex would be awesome if you could go back through this series with the updated version of Quantopian. I find your style of teaching so easy to follow but I am unable to follow along with this module as there are simply too many syntax changes in the new Quantopian and I am getting both syntax errors + deprecated warnings. I have tried to solve them myself which has been interesting but got nowhere really :( Keep up the good work though!,True

@completebhejafry,2015-11-04T08:38:03Z,0,"Hey! Great series of videos, I'm very grateful to you for putting this up.  One question: is the definition for context.fundamentals like a keyword or something?  Basically what I'm asking is that can I write something like this:  context.fundamentals_buy=get_fundamentals( put one bunch of conditions here) context.fundamentals_sell=get_fundamentals( put another bunch of conditions here)  So basically when i rebalance, I want to check if any stock in my portfolio is IN the buy, and not in the sell. When it shows up in the sell side, that's when I want to trigger a sale.   Is that possible?   Thanks! anees   PS: just gave it a try on Quantopian, but it didn't make any buys or sells. How can I share the code with you?",True
@balavigneshk5382,2015-11-01T13:16:24Z,0,"hi +sentdex, thanks for the great tutorial.  I didn't quite follow the for loop in the rebalance function initially, but then I got it.",True
@sonanceful,2015-08-06T00:07:39Z,0,"Hi Sentdex, Thanks for creating these videos they are pretty awesome. I do have question about the logic in for the statement ""if stock not in context.fundamentals and stock in data:"". Are we telling it not to choose stock from our filter and then validating that this is a real stock even though we are grabbing it from our portfolio?",True
@thebalrog1853,2015-07-13T02:56:12Z,0,You're a hero man. I love your video tutorials on this fascinating topic. You have good energy and are really knowledgeable. Keep it up! I'm learning lots,True

@kaleabwoldemariam4288,2015-07-08T01:01:49Z,0,"sentdex, Thank you for your posts.I tried your strategy sell logic algorithm, but for some reason the return is flat at 0%. i guess the order code is not implemented in the code. I get the message PRINT dataframe object is not callable and next line failed in the main loop. Any suggestions?",True
