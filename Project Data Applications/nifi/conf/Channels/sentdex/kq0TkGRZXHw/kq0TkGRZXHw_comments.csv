@mrbighit,2014-11-15T10:04:54Z,0,"Using python3 and having a lot of trouble with this line converting from python2 to python3 incomeDate, income = np.loadtxt(netIncAr, delimiter=',', unpack=True, 										converters={ 0: mdates.strpdate2num(""%Y-%m-%d"")})  I'm getting the error message: argument 0 must be str, not <class 'bytes'>  I tried this workaround from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16496017/typeerror-when-using-matplotlibs-strpdate2num-with-python-3-2 , but it still doesn't work.  Any chance you could write the python3 code in your comments?  Thanks.",True
@ortzg,2013-11-24T07:30:16Z,0,Just wondering what other people's experience with quandl is like. I just tried to load the complete financial ratios of around 4 companies but the csv file i got back is only partially filled. I tried with 2 companies and it's the same thing. In both cases the csv returned exactly 102 columns (including the date column) that got filled. The rest of the remaining columns are empty It seems the 102 columns is a very limiting factor if one needs bigger dataset.,True
