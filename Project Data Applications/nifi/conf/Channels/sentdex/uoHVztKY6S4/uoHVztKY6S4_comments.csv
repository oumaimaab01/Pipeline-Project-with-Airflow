@eaterofsouls6077,2022-11-04T13:53:44Z,0,"Hi! Is there any way to combine this lemmatization technique with the part of speech tagging from 3 episodes before? I see the tags are different than in the example with the presidental speech, but is there any other way apart from putting all tags through a switch case?",True

@srithar94,2021-05-01T16:19:28Z,0,"If we are using lemmatizer with first letter being caps, then desired result is not achieved. So convert all your words to lowercase i guess   For example:  For the word - Importance Lemma is - Importance and corresponding stem is - import For the word - Cats Lemma is - Cats and corresponding stem is - cat For the word - Geese Lemma is - Geese and corresponding stem is - gees For the word - Rocks Lemma is - Rocks and corresponding stem is - rock For the word - Cacti Lemma is - Cacti and corresponding stem is - cacti   For the word - importance Lemma is - importance and corresponding stem is - import For the word - cats Lemma is - cat and corresponding stem is - cat For the word - geese Lemma is - goose and corresponding stem is - gees For the word - rocks Lemma is - rock and corresponding stem is - rock For the word - cacti Lemma is - cactus and corresponding stem is - cacti",True
@antoinefdu,2021-03-04T18:13:08Z,0,"""better"" is an excellent example to show the differences in interpretation between pos parameters: lemmatizer.lemmatize('better', 'a') ==> 'good' lemmatizer.lemmatize('better', 'v') ==> 'better' lemmatizer.lemmatize('better', 'r') ==>  'well'",True
@kinvert,2020-11-26T20:43:56Z,6,"I know I'm pointing out something you worked hard at and you already know this.  Almost EVERY time I search for something in Python etc, you come up with a very useful video in the search results.  I write code that helps people. I bet a lot of others here do too. And you help us. I can't even imagine how many people you're ultimately helping with your videos.  Thanks man.",True

@GelsYT,2019-04-07T16:11:54Z,0,"so when you say lemmatizer.lemmatize(""better"",pos=""a"")  the pos means that  you are expecting an output that is in the parts of speech of an adjective right? PLEASE ANSWER MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE <3 THANKS",True

@bonsonsm,2015-05-28T05:55:09Z,3,"Thanks for the videos. One doubt is that so how do I know which POS I should apply to which word during lemmatization?  e.g. If a text contains 500 words and I want to lemmatize it to get the root word of all the words in an automated manner, then what should be the approach?",True
