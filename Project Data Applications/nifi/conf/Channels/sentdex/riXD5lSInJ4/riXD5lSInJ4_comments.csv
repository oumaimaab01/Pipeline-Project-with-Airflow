@nathanwhittle1,2019-01-28T21:22:58Z,11,"Sentdex- I'm glad to see you updating your Django series! I used your old series to jumpstart my learning of Django, and have since taken off in my own direction, so I wanted to thank you for giving me that start!  Now that you're taking another pass at Django, I wanted to share one of the habits I've formed since I experienced your series. There are a lot of strategies to organizing a django app well, and over time I have found that this cookiecutter build for creating a blank app is a fantastic way to start things off- https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django. While it can be a bit overwhelming for (absolute) beginners, it saves lots of time for setting up deployment to Heroku, PythonAnywhere, etc. and sets up a new app in certain ways which form extremely good long-term habits- like for example separating your config into base, local, and production. It also pre-configures and sets up certain third-party libraries which I find I usually will end up using anyway. I find that it helped me build good habits that make for clean and well organized apps, and I wish I had found it sooner before I had to learn my way out of bad habits. Sentdex- if you check it out and find that it is valuable, perhaps you would consider making a video covering its use? I think it would be a great addition to your series (perhaps towards the end once the basics have been introduced). Thanks again for your awesome videos! I don't know where I'd be now if it wasn't for all your helpful content :)",True
