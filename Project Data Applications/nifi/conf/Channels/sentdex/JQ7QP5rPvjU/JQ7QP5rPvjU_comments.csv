@Wawster5,2024-04-09T13:08:40Z,0,"First of all, thanks so much for these tutorials they've been a great help. I've got a quick question though, and I know I'm commenting on a 9 year old video but I've tried searching online and I can't seem to find a solution.  By making the graph live it makes it so the toolbar functions (pan/zoom) reset when the graph updates. Or more specifically, it's caused by constantly calling '.clear()' on the subplot through the animate function. But by not doing so it only keeps making additional subplots instead of updating the existing one like I want.   Do you know of any way to stop the .clear() from resetting the pan/zoom? Or if that is not possible, a way to actually update the values of the subplot instead of clearing it and plotting it again? I don't know if this would stop it from resetting the pan/zoom though.  I did have to switch the toolbar to 'NavigationToolbar2Tk' instead of 'NavigationToolbar2TkAgg' because the latter has deprecated. I do not believe this would have an impact on my problem or otherwise though.",True
