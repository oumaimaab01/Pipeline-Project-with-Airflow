@skilz8098,2020-05-17T05:23:49Z,0,"I've been following your Neural Network videos and been implementing them in Python myself, and I truly like your videos and your explanation behind them. Just enough details to cover the math behind it along with the ability to design proper algorithms in source code to make it happen. Maybe not the most efficient or most readable per se, but just the minimal amount of code to make it work is a great way to cover a simple yet complex topic... It may seem complex to those who don't know about it at first, but after getting a better understanding of it from your channel to implement it in Python in which I'm fairly new to and from 3Blue1Brown with the knowledge of the structures and mathematics behind it, I can actually attest that building a working 3D Game Engine from Scratch is a much harder task!   I'm more of a C++ person mainly because I prefer that language over most others since I work with 3D graphics involving programmable pipelines using various graphics APIs such as Direct X, OpenGL, and now Vulkan. Therefore my preferred languages of choice are centered around the C languages! I use C from time to time, C++ most often, and on very rare occasions C#. I'm purely self-taught without any college courses on the subjects. I've been working with computers for a very long time and I'm always learning about them. My first encounter with a computer was in Elementary School in the mid-80s around 86-88 where the computer itself was a big thick keyboard with a slot on the side for a cartridge and it was wired to a small monitor. If you did not have a cartridge in the computer and you powered it on, there was only a cursor on the blank screen. There was no operating system, there was no DOS, there was no filesystem... You could, however, write a function if you knew the native language of that machine...  10 var a = 1 20 var b = 5 30 var c = a + b 40 print c  something like that... it's been so long I don't remember the Basic or that particular machine's language, otherwise, just plug in the cartridge before turning on the computer...   Then as time went on we were introduced to some Apple II's and Apple II e's or some Win 3.11 / Dos 5.0/6.0 machines. In fact, the first PC I ever got which was around 92-94 when I was in middle school was a Dos 6.0 machine, it either had Win 3.11 or OS/2 I don't remember which exactly... The good old Dos Days, installing Doom, Doom II, Theme Park, Seventh Guest, 11th Hour, Rodger Wilco's Space Quest IV, Death Race, etc. and getting them to work by properly setting the correct DMA Channels and the appropriate IRQs to get the video and sound to work to be able to play it was days of explorations...  C:\> C:\> cd Games C:\Games> C:\Games>MD Doom C:\Games> C:\>Games>dir \\ Dos's directory list... (don't feel like typic this bs out, haha). C:\Games>A: A:\>copy *.* C:\Games\Doom\ A:\>C: C:\> C:\>cd Games\Doom C:\Games\Doom> C:\Games\Doom> setup.exe or install.exe ...  You get the point... and I was only bout 12-14 back then when learning to use Dos.

I am a data science major; I got into the major after following a lot of your videos and being really interested in what you were teaching. Anyways the classes are nothing a-like. STA 131B is the course. All we learn about are proofs.  Posterior and prior distributions, MLE, sufficient statistcs, Moment of methods estimators. Even the statistical learning course(machine learning) I am taking is super theory based and giving me headaches and making me hate stats and data science.  I have no clue how any of this is relevant or can be applied in the future. I am into machine learning and stocks. All this crazy notation and statistical theory that seems to come from nowhere is driving me crazy. I don't see the point, I don't see how any of this is applicable. Maybe if I really had a problem and wanted to dive into the formulas more within application but I don't see the point of learning all this theory, It's so much that I can't remember it and not seeing the point is killing my motivation and energy.

@yongamer,2018-03-08T19:50:56Z,90,"I have only seen this video so far, but I decided to review this series based on my first impressions.  There's currently 72 videos in this playlist, and their duration is between 6 and 35 minutes. Probably averaging around 12 minutes. The early episodes are shorter, and the further into the playlist, the longer they become. If my assmption of the avarage length is correct, then the total length of the playlist is 14.4 hours. This seems like a reasonable investment of time if the content has the quality required.   The viewercount for the following episodes at the time of posting is: 1. 801 800 2. 457 105 3. 228 484 4. 165 839 5. 121 622 6. 65 289 7. 72 790 8. 56 255  9. 46 845 10. 44 754  11. 38 835 12. 40 763  13. 47 566 14. 63 138  15. 48 586 16. 33 984 17. 31 051 18. 28 916 19. 24 556 20. 56 084 30. 19 184 40. 12 419 50. 51 678 60. 26 063 70. 11 352 71. 11 456 72. 23 671  With these numbers, I try to analyze how successful students of this series are. I accept that I may use a bad method. The viewercount stabilize around 10 000 to 50 000 views. I assume that the people who watch episode 2 actually is motivated about learning how to do machine learning on python. From episode 2 to 3, the viewer count drops from 457 000 to 228 000 views, which is a decrease of 49% of the viewers. This implies that theres a 49% chance of completing the second episode. With the same type of thinking, the chance of completing episode 2 and 3 is 36%. The chance of completing episode 2 up to the 50'000 views videos is 10%.    For the titles, one can categorize a set of videos into the following chapters: -regression -r squared -k nearest -support vector machine -kernel -mean shift -neural network -application for machine learning.  Having few chapters is a good thing, this way it is more easy to go back and review videos.  You consistenty have above 97% like/dislike, which implies that the viewers has a very good impression.    My first impression, is that this is a good series. You loose a lot of viewers throughout the series, but I guess that is expected from any comprehensive algorithm tutorial. The like to dislike ratio is very good as well. By this I conclude that it is worth at least giving this tutorial a shot.",True

However, a question that kept popping up over and over in the last months in my mind is: The beginner - intermediate skills set of a guy who can fit a machine learning model...could't that be replaced very easy by artificial intelligence? An application that knows the assumptions for all the models, tests which model would be suited best for the data, fits the model etc. etc. And if that is the case, then being able to perform e.g. linear regression for prediction purposes isn't worth anything in a few years when such an AI app works very well...What do you think about that?",True
