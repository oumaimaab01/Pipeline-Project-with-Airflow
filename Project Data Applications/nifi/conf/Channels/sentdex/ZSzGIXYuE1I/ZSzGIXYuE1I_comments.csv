@herzberg1114,2020-08-31T13:27:29Z,1,"Hi Sentdex, this is a great Django series and I really want to thank you.  I ran into one issue during part 11. In your video you show the ""return render(request,                       'main/tutorial.html',                       {""tutorial"":this_tutorial,                       ""sidebar"": tutorials_from_series,                       ""this_tutorial_idx"": this_tutorial_idx})"" in the views.py file.   However, in the text-based tutorial on pythonprogramming.net you write: ""return render(request=request,                       template_name='main/tutorial.html',                       context={""tutorial: ""this_tutorial,                                ""sidebar"": tutorials_from_series,                                ""this_tut_idx"": this_tutorial_idx})"".   In the latter case, I got the following error: TypeError: 'module' object is not iterable. By using the code in your video everything works fine. Maybe the text-based tutorial need an update?   Kind regards",True

@billfujimoto5905,2020-04-11T22:35:41Z,0,"I'm seeing a different behavior in the URL which appends the tutorial slug to the series slug like this:  http://localhost:8000/python-fundamentals/function-1  python-fundamentals is the series slug, function-1 is the tutorial slug.  Since the tutorial slug is nested under the series slug, this causes the views.py to miss the tutorial slug entirely and I get an error which says page not found (404).  I noticed in the video, when you clicked on the tutorial button, the URL replaced series slug with the tutorial slug as a single slug.  I don't know where or how this difference in behavior is determined.  However, when I enter http://localhost:8000/function-1 manually, I get the expected tutorial rendering.  I don't see where my code is any different as I tried to replicate it as closely as possible.  I tried both Django2 and Django3 but made no difference.  I'm hoping one of you experts can point out the solution.  Thanks!",True
