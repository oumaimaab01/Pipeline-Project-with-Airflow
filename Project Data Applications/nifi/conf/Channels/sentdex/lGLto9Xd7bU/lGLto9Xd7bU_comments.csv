I assume when NN is learning you just input cat picture and tell it that its cat.  do the different nuerons represent how likely it sees whisker, how likely it sees dog nose, how likely it sees cat nose, how likely it sees cat eyes, how likely it sees dog eyes?  at that point, i imagine we have to code up functions for detecting whiskers, cat & dog noses & eyes. this will involve many if statements. at that point isn't the concept of NN broken? ex: we can't code up every possible if statement to a self driving car; my assumption is that the driving force of NN is that we don't have to code up all these logical ifs - it learns by itself.  i quickly looked thru the code in the videos (maybe a couple minutes thru all 5 currently available videos), its just a bunch of numpy math, that is not too hard to understand. what i fail to understand is the why & what of those nueron values&weights and how in the end it actually teaches & classifes.   i hope my question is clear & you or someone can help clear up my confusion.",True

@morthim,2020-04-25T03:57:16Z,0,"a dumb math question. why is your algebraic offset called a bias? in algebra, basic stuff, output = coeffecient*independant_value +offset a bias has two meanings, in colloqueal speech it is a disposition towards something, in formal statistical speech it is a disposition against something. i'm going to use the colloqueal one because it is more mathmatically elegant. if you have a bias towards icecream, each sub category has a 1 net sum value. if you are 30% disposed towards vanilla, that is a bias of 0.30. similarly for two other categories of chocolat with 40% and carmel with 29% and 1% all other, you end up with a sum of all polymorphic directions adding up to a sum of 1. in vector space this would be like you have a known disposition one direction, and you know that the disposition is ballanced. if the disposition  in direction x = 5, and you know that there are 2 more vectors, and one specifically is -1/8x + 19; you can solve how much 'bias' or length the known counter ballance is, and infer the third dimension's direction and bias (or weight).   so why are biases offseting neurons? instead of giving further weighting to all functions? and why are layers not actually biased? why don't layers have to distribute importance or bias, as that would give the easiest culling capability? yes it would lead to overfitting but i'm trying to figure out what the name is supposed to imply, and why it is chosen. it sorta acts as a scalar, but not really.   not scaling each neuron reduces math a bit, perhaps, but it also means a lack of value normalization. maybe it is optimizing the wrong thing to give each neuron a scalar which is independant of the 'biases' individually creating the next row/collumn/layer.  it boosts the signals.   also why ""bias"" at all? wouldn't not biasing just lead to inversions? you have a range which is created by the sum of the weighted inputs, if you offset it or bias it, you just shift the number space around the slope, but the function is the same. i think i already disclosed in this comment that you are using complex numbers which are far less restricted than hexidecimal, offsetting hexidecimal with a bias by saying ""anything below x doesn't matter"" through subtract x, it renorms the number space, but if you are using s32 or s64 or floats, is there really benefit to it? with a billion values possible, and computers not really carring about scale as long as it fits within the register, do you get a benefit from it?   another thought related to norming of space is that there is a bias introduced towards ""less than"". because you are adding the number instead of subtracting it. i'm not really getting if this would 'clean' the data. the need of cleaning is the regular spreading of traits into combinatoric categories, which would warp both the maximum and minimum initially but also turn all subclassifications into sequential states. maybe the multiple layers act as multiple passes, so the warping of data into the regular int number space just takes one additional layer. then every additional layer would be able to solve for an additional bit, and perhaps 3 layers could get 4 or 5 significant bits.   another thing i'm noticing which may be inappropriate, is that you have both negative and complex numbers. i was under the interpretation that hexidecimal would give better fitting since every layer would refine the signal 93.75% *neuron count, and it would also be quite a bit smaller or denser.   last thing i'm noticing is the lack of logic. the ""bias"" sort-of operates as a limiter cause i suspect if a value overflows it becomes all 1111s. thus ""if x > constant"" could be written in a neuron as if constant+x = overflow. this extended combinatorially could allow upper and lower limits, with neurons individuated for purposes.   i lied, is the summing of values at a hard coded level intrinsic to neural networks or would being able to shift from sums to more complicated convergences still a neural net? take my x>constant as litteral code. is that shift of ""if rebiased_neuron_one_for_next_layer > rebiased_variable_two_for_next_layer, do something"" still a neural net? is a neural net the data structure itself? if so which parts are requisite?   okay last last thing for real this time. is their neural pruning like human brains do, where the dependence of neurons or perceptions either cull dependencies or skip layers?   ... ... i'm really tempted to get your book. i bought $30 worth of udemy classes just a week before i found that you were doing this though. also i've spent a bit over a $100 bucks, not including hardware, just on trying to learn how to do this. i promise that if you get me to a level that the current sale on humble isn't tempting i'll buy your book.   i think you took my previous comment more personally than intended. i'm spending money and the stuff i'm getting is either really simple or really complex. either it explains common knowledge like ""neural nets take complex problems and breaks them into simpler problems"" and ""(sigma) for x =i (infinity) pvnx +compulex() "" neither of which are helpful. your videos are right now in the prime middle of usefulness, but to be truely useful as a reference i need both positive and negative knowledge. explaining how to do stuff has value, but why permutations which seem obvious are redundent or unnecessary will give a better base understanding. like i know that you don't permutate the sum with conditional subtractions because it is a performance hit and you use signed values instead. but why don't you use multiplications conditionally? is it cause the next layer's coeffeciences basicly cause the same thing though it requires another layer?   i have two core tasks i want to know how to do: useful tasks (for example image (contents) recognition) base skill for base skill i'm wanting to learn how to write polymorphic code cause i suck at it.   right now, based on my ""intermediate"" skill level, if i was trying to get a neural net to scan data input for useful data, and do a complex transformation, it would be come O('notation') bad. if i was trying to have the neural network change not just weights of various variable but the relationship of the variable, i might use a copout like signed digits, but i might even use something horrible like a switch or case statement. and suddenly the amount of memory needed would explode. signed digits would get rid of having to have subtraction, but every time a combinatoric problem uses something even as simple as an addition or multiplication, that geometrically increases the cost. and since signed digits only do +- signing not multiplicative signing, stuff like variable passthroughs become needed. the problem with my intermediate programing skill is that i can't figure out how to get rid of those 'goto' statements. so even if it was appropriate to allow a neural network to change how many perceptrons it has, or their number_space_size, it would incur major penalties redefining arrays every iteration through the web. some of it is flinging shit at a wall. like what abotu real biasing by creating an extension of the output layer which informs the next base biasing of the collumn's weights? by using x and y offsets you can contract and recenter data ranges. this sorta allows a procession of values, using the number space a bit like a series of clocks, and when a clock strikes 1111 (or max) then the answer can be returned. but for that to mean anythign you would need hard rows which extend through the entire network, and you wouldn't get layers which were bigger or smaller. it is enough to be frustrating, but not enough to offer useful fixes. the core problem of ""how do you get neural network propogation to occur in roughly neuron.count() cycles per training cycle"", is just beyond me. it isn't really overshooting in aspirations, but it isn't clear how to do it so you get a variety of different neural network solutions which instead of trying to overfit, go through different approaches to solve- sorta like each using different regression methods.",True

It was established that each neuron has its bias and it is constant irrespective of what input value is being given to it, what I want to know is regarding value of weights, do they remain same for a specific input value or they can change as in, if I supply a value of 1.1 to a neuron, the weight associated with it will always be, lets say 0.5. Will this weight remain same irrespective of how may times I pass 1.1 to it or will it change depending on some factors?",True

@kenchang3456,2020-04-16T16:14:16Z,19,"Hi Sentdex.  I saw that you will be covering the mysteries of the values for weights and biases but, my question is, is there a rule of thumb for what the range of values should be for biases?  E.g. in the video you use values from 0 to 3.  What is the effect of using whacky like 1, 0.5, 100?  Would that be a waste of cycles when it comes time to train the model?",True
