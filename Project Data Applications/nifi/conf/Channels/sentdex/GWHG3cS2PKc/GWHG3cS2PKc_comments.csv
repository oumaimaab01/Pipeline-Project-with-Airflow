@shaunsawyer8298,2018-01-10T04:50:44Z,0,"Nice illustrative example. Just for kicks numpy actually supports broadcasting and has all the functionality you need to implement knn.

Is this something that we should be aware of when using cross_validation with a small set of data or is it an expected behavior?

@ernesto1654,2017-08-13T04:15:57Z,7,"Another efficiency change that you could have made is to not take the square root in the euclidean distance. It's a very expensive function and it's not required at all for comparing distances (since is a strictly growing function). In other words, if we let d1 be one distance and d2 be another and d1 > d2, then d1^2 > d2^2. Thus you don't have to take the square root.",True

@misaelalarcon4792,2016-07-01T21:20:19Z,2,Hi Sentdex! I really like your machine learning tutorials. It's just that I came looking for neural networks and I think it won't be the case. What is the difference between machine learning and neural networks? Can I do the same with neural networks? Are you thinking on making some tutorials of neural networks with python? Thank you and great job!,True
@gratephulshred,2016-05-24T02:23:16Z,19,"FYI, although not important on the dataset used here, if this function were for actual production use you could gain quite a bit of efficiency by only tracking the 3 smallest distances, rather than tracking all of them and then sorting.  Tracking all of them uses an additional O(N) memory, and is O(N log N) time for the sort.  However, if you were to simply track the 3 smallest distances (i.e. once you build up to 3, only replace if smaller than one of the three), this is O(1) additional space, and O(1) per loop, so O(N) time complexity.",True
