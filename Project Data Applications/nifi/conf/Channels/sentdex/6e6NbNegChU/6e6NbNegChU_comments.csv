@enlost3052,2022-03-25T00:35:51Z,0,"set the distance between the corners to 3 or 5 , instead of 10 and we will the get that inner corner in 'e'. corners = cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack(gray,74,0.01,3)..........this will get the best results acc. to me which I could find. This also includes the 2 corners on the bottom of the stick of exclamation mark.",True

@MagicalSAMElectronics,2018-05-25T12:42:13Z,1,its not working.....seems like the syntax has been changed.is it??,True
@PS-gr7px,2018-01-02T17:56:29Z,0,The corner in the inside of 'e' wasn't detected because 10 is too large for a minimum distance between corners. Try 5,True

@MrFTW733,2017-08-29T17:56:31Z,0,thank you for sharing this!  I'm doing volunteer work at a 3D printing lab and i'm doing something like this on opencv but need to make the algorithm for C++  can you make a video on that?,True
@mukeshsinghbhakuni3819,2017-08-13T20:18:02Z,0,how does corner detection work mathematically  in other words intrnally,True
@SirCorrino,2017-07-19T11:12:55Z,14,"You didn't find the inside corner of the 'e' because it was too close to the corner on the opposite side. Also, if you set the quality to for example 0.1 instead of 0.01 you don't get the false positives from the aliasing. With quality 0.1 and minDistance 5 you catch every actual corner in the sample you used.",True

@MattCamp,2016-04-02T14:37:44Z,18,something I have noticed over the past couple videos is that you aren't doing cv2.waitKey(0) any more. I seem to have to do it or my picture window closes immediately. Think its a change to cv2 or am I just doing something stupid?,True
