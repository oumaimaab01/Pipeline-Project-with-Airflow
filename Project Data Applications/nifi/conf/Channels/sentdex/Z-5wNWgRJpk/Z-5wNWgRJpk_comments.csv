@adeshmallaHQ,2018-06-14T06:59:44Z,1,"I feel like there is bias in the data [Data Snooping or Look ahead].  The percentage change for a one day look back period shows up earlier than we might have access to the data and the same continues for others.   for example df = pd.read_csv('sp500_joined_closes.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col=0) df['AAPL_rets'] = df['AAPL'].pct_change() ..................... and.................. df['AAPL_1d'] = (df['AAPL'].shift(-1) - df['AAPL'])/df[AAPL'] should have the same result.   I'm Confused each look back period assumes that the future data is already available for use which is a huge bias. Please correct me if I'm wrong",True

@tomvkgames,2017-08-16T21:54:04Z,2,"I still don""t understand the shift part in line: df[""{}_{}d"".format(ticker, i)] = (df[ticker].shift(-i) - df[ticker])/ df[ticker]  First question: You said that: df[""{}_{}d"".format(ticker, i)]  is the Adj Close value for i days in the future. But you also don't know df[ticker].shift(-i), because that just gives NaN because future data is not known, so how does this works. Because now the equasion is: a = b-c/c. Where in you don't know a and b?  And the other question why do you fillna two times?",True
@Locke19901,2017-08-16T17:27:41Z,0,In your defining of the set up (new to ML here) you define buys and sells as movements beyond 2% in a set time frame.  So the parameters here are the threshold (2%) and time.  Is there any optimization of ML techniques where it could return what these parameters should be?  Or is it brute force iterated ML through these parameters and then you evaluate them by whatever metrics you want?  Or is there some other method?   Or am I getting WAAY AHEAD of myself?  Ha.  Thanks AS ALWAYS.,True
