@TheOleHermit,2020-07-24T18:31:48Z,0,"@Sentdex, thank you for posting such helpful videos. However, just a note to inform you that I downloaded your RPi OpenCV image 2 1/2 times to 2 different computers (RPi4B & Surface Pro) and used Balena Etcher & Imager to burn it onto 4 different uSD cards (2 new, all work on other builds). However, your image does nothing on a RPI 3A+. There's only a power LED and no disk activity. Do I need to boot w/NOOBS, then run rpi-update before using your image? Some say yes, others say no. Been lost in the OpenCV installation rabbit hole for over a week, now. So many installs, too many version conflicts. Was really hoping that your image would avoid these obstacles. Would appreciate feedback from anyone who knows of current sources for successful installations of OpenCV. Otherwise, I'll try mitchtech.net. Thanks.ðŸ˜Ž",True

@sentdex,2016-03-01T01:02:32Z,0,"+pirateman Considering the Raspberry Pi has does a full 10x improvement in the last 4 years, giving up on it for 2 years straight is pretty silly. Not only that, but a Pi from 2 years ago was capable of doing quite a bit of OpenCV calculations. Sure, if you were using the pi for capturing video, manipulating/analyzing video, and then outputting it, it probably was a bit slow, but still possible, and much better today than 2 years ago.

I have been working on an automated sorting robot to sort tested RAM modules at work using the SPD data to decide what module goes where. unfortunately alot of third party RAM companies use name brand ram (such as hynix or micron) and place their labels on the name brand modules, so you might get a module that says Crucial or kingston on it, but gets sorted as a hynix module since hynix was the original manufacturer. I have been looking into opencv as a alternative to make this project work. I am hoping I will be successful in training opencv to recognize the logos of all the name brand modules so they can get sorted correctly. thanks again for sharing your knowledge with all of us it is very inspiring to see your work",True
