@WolfVanWeen,2016-02-22T10:19:07Z,8,"Love your tutorials. So well-structured, well-explained and authentic. Thank you! Couple of comments for beginners working through this: - GET is the default method, if nothing is specified. Only when you need POST, you need to specify it. (and no matter how much you play around in the browser's address bar, it's always going to create a GET request ;) ) - The <BODY></BODY> tags actually shouldn't be there, right? They're duplicates, as this is already specified in the header.html",True
