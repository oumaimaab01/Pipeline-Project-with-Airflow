@bendgk123,2015-08-06T05:20:40Z,0,For the pivot_left function it would be easier to call the turn_right function along with turn_left (going backwards) and vice versa for pivot_right.  Also you should add another argument to every function called direction which would save you A LOT of time for coding and then rename the function to motor_left or motor_right (or anything you really want) otherwise amazing tutorial it helped a lot! ,True
