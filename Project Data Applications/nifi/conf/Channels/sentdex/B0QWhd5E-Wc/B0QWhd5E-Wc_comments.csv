@M0481,2016-07-01T21:09:41Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, I am writing this comment cause I am in need of some advice. I love Data Science and everything related to it. To keep pursuing my goals I learned how to program and taught myself Calculus/statistics as well.  I think I am going in the right direction, but maybe you could give me some advice. I like doing projects, what do you do when you want to learn something yourself? Do you have certain websites that do challenges and that help you learn data science related topics as you go?",True

@jeffx4655,2016-01-08T03:52:17Z,0,"Hi @sentdex, thank you for your instruction videos. It's really helpful for me to learn new stuff such as new modules. I wonder if you plan to push new videos teaching ppl how to read/understand source code of modules? I am trying to read some source code but find it's quite annoying because I don't find any clue or good suggestion on how to read these codes. Thanks.",True

@trench6118,2015-11-30T13:11:24Z,0,"Any potential to review existing code? My challenge is that I googled for alternatives to Excel and found pandas. Fast forward a year later and I have pandas/python doing a lot of my work for me but mainly because I am like.. 'how do I do this in pandas' and then modify someone's solution. I am just now going back and trying to make my code more error-resistant, add defs, schedule programs to run, etc. It would be nice to have someone review my code and understand what I am trying to do and help point me towards a better way or explain concepts etc.",True

@evildoctorbluetooth,2015-09-12T23:34:18Z,0,"hi sentdex. would you consider a series based on spiking neural networks?  i have worked on them myself, and i wonder if the optimizations that making time a numy array allows, are worth the extra memory.",True
@theJUSTICEof666,2015-09-12T06:11:44Z,2,I will likely make your subscriber count += 1. I really like the concept and downloading some videos would be amazing for going on vacation. Thank you!,True
@5zazen,2015-09-12T06:10:01Z,0,Thank you for your videos.  The amount of material is amazing.

So far I'm into this since late June.,True

@neonz2712,2015-09-11T22:02:02Z,0,I like the idea of this but wouldn't like to pay for +=1! In saying this will you be focusing more toward this program than your YouTube? I've been watching you for a year and a half and would hate for you to slow down on video production. Best of luck to you!!!,True

@MrIkariaman,2015-09-11T21:37:01Z,1,"First of all, I am a pleb, in other words, not going to pay/subscribe, but I think that doing something like that is amazing and I would like to wish you good luck on in. Another thing that may encourage people to become subscribers would be releasing some videos earlier for them (just like patreon, but hosted in your own site perhaps?), having a subscriber only lounge(something like a mini-forum) where you interact with subscribers. These are just some ideas from the top of my head but I'm sure you can check other people who use youtube as their main source of income for monetization tips.",True
