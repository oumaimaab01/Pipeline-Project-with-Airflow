Is there a method of retraining just the top dense layer of the TF Object detection model without destroying the inherent detection capabilities of the original?  Similar to what can be done with VGG-16 and other TF classification models.  I'm trying to add detection capability to the original TF Object detection model and adding this back to the original model - results in a single collection if inputs to multiple outputs.  Seems feasible if I could extract just the last CNN outputs and extract the TF Object detection dense layer(s) gains.  I've done this for VGG-16 but this is classification, not object detection.

If you have the tf_slim directory added to PYTHONPATH. you can basically run your code from anywhere so your object_detection directory stays clean. Just specify the full paths in config files. 2. The new version of object detection seems to have a bug where it would show error when running the export inference graph file.      https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/16268 this fixes it.  I have written a GUI for performing the whole training and exporting thing. If you want, please visit https://github.com/hrshovon/tf_sensei to download and use it.

I successfully trained the data and able to make webcam to detect my class; however, when I turn on the webcam, it seems like its detecting everything/people/background as the class I trained. I'm currently using the config file that you used on the video and using one class.   1) Do you have any idea why it would detect every single frame as the class? if so, how should I fix it? 2)  For the training images, does it need to be in steady background or can it be all sorts of other variation of lights/background or other settings?

But i have some of the doubts ...     i have model which is train accordingly what you teach here.  It is trained on Screwdriver , Now when i am passing opne sport car image for testing its showing ScrewDriver with 98% accuracy. I can understand that when i am training my model with one object its show label of that object, but accuracy should be very minimum which is not in my case. So basically how can i improve my model ? how can i tell my model that if object is not there in the image show very less probability. So please help me . i have to complete my project",True

If other people are retraining with more than one class, make changes to object-detection.pbtxt, generate_tfrecord and  the config file as mentioned, then clear out your old checkpoint files and put a fresh mobilenet copy. Then it will retrain without hitting the tensor shape mismatch error. You have to do this every time you add more classes",True
