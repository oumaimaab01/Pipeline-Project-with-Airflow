@anony88,2017-11-24T17:08:07Z,0,"Sentdex you can still get hundreds of thousands of comments off of reddit a day, just FYI(perhaps every couple hours). I stored over a hundred thousand submissions alone into a mysql database within 8 hours. Comments come in a LOT faster. If you did that, I wouldn't recommend mysql from personal experience as it can slow down a lot after a couple hundred thousand submissions. I'm sure you know that. There are definitely faster storage solutions for big data. If you do your own script, you can easily exclude certain subreddits or keep it confined to certain subreddits. It's easy to do with praw. I've done all of that.",True

@machapuis,2017-11-24T16:26:50Z,7,"Nested queries are more time effective. Exemple : WHERE name=name AND address=address is costing a lot more because it is searching all the database each time to compare. However, the nested query WHERE name=name AND ( SELECT address ...) is costing less because it has pre-selected a portion of the database to compare. Hope this helps!",True
