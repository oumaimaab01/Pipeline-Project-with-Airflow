@arturbegyan5207,2017-03-30T19:29:07Z,0,They use 255 as a limit because that is the highest number you can store if 8 bits of memory are allocated for storing a particular number in the universe of shares. It is the same issue that Pacman had with the number of levels you could play :),True

@liamolson-kenny7460,2016-06-07T10:15:26Z,0,Quantopian 2 no longer has a limit of # of assets and also doesn't allow iteration over data. Can you provide an example of how we would achieve the same results in this video under the new api? Thanks just getting started.,True
@williamriley9542,2016-05-10T22:45:34Z,0,"I don't know if you still read these comments, but i'll try anyways. First of all, thanks so much for the vids, they are super helpful. As you may know, quantopian has updated a few of their python commands and how they are calling variables and this is leading to some problems for me. One of the things is that they switched out context.fundamentals they have switched to fundamentals_df, or at least this is what i'm getting from it. This being like this, when I try to update_universe(context.fundamentals.columns.values) or update_universe(fundamentals_df.columns.values) it gives me an error. Can you explain this?  I uploaded a pic on imgur if you're having trouble with my horrible explanation. http://imgur.com/JzCV7xU  Thanks!",True

@Lonamafaufau,2015-08-13T08:25:46Z,0,"Hi Harrison, thank you for such great tutorials. I do a lot of learning off youtube videos for various other topics, and I've got to say that your videos are hands down the most helpful and engaging. I will be sure to make a donation. I have one minor question about one line of code. Would it be ok to use the following code for current_position, or would something different happen under the hood?       current_positions = context.portfolio.positions          for stock in data:         current_position = current_positions[stock].amount  Once again, thank you for your great teaching ability.",True
@troyw6681,2015-08-12T01:44:17Z,4,"Love these videos!  As a newbie, I found I had two pressing questions when watching, that  I think other newbies might have.   First, could you further explain why plausible_investment is equal to cash divided by ten? That hardcoded ten is driving me nuts. Next, at the 5m20s mark you give us the first mention of update_universe().  Thanks to your explanation, I can now imagine that companies are going to be drifting into and out of our top 10 based upon the fundamental metrics filter we created.  So, my question is... when the universe is updated, is a company that drifted out of the top 10 still available to trade in the handle_data method?  Thanks.",True

Is there anything you'd recommend to get up to speed with the purely financial side? So far been hitting investopedia for definitions (sharpe ratio, pe ratio etc.) but it would be good to have an understanding of the basics prior to writing code. Thanks again!",True
