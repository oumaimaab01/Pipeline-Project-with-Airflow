@pietrop8932,2016-12-07T10:34:27Z,0,"hi Sentdex, this snippet produces features in a vectorised way, no need to double looping, and in my case it is much quicker to run. Please let me know your comments.

@liminm7451,2015-08-10T11:51:50Z,0,"Dear Sir,  I little bit confuse with this statement  features = np.around(np.diff(pricing_list) / pricing_list[:-1] * 100.0, 1) why you divide with pricing_list[-1] # the last value of pricing list, not the whole pricing list ?  Thx",True
