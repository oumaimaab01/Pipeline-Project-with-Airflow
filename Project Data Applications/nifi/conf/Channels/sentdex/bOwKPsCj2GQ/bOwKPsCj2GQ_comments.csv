@alihusham1560,2020-07-12T14:56:29Z,0,"I see some people still using flask fro back end in order to use ML for their web apps!, is that still necessary with TensorFlow js? in other word does TensorFlow js have all the required features?",True
@leetmann,2020-02-17T15:07:17Z,0,"this shows how real coding is done. Everything online today teaches coding as if it sort magic and no errors come in your way doing coding, but that clearly is not the case. I love how he is encountering errors and solving them live rather than editing them out. new coders can learn a lot from him, how to debug your code.   @sentdex please make some tutorials on Tensorflow lite.",True
@frankmazzarella5839,2018-08-01T03:06:28Z,0,Hey make sure to always add a .catch() to your promises.  If the promise rejects with an error and you do not have a catch block you will get an unhandled rejection error.,True

@dechaomeng9866,2018-06-19T04:47:35Z,0,"I suggest to use ES6 or TypeScript to introduce tfjs. They are superclass  of js, and both support class, interface and other advanced features of modern programming language. Typescript support type annotation.",True
@NetherlandsTop40,2018-06-18T14:22:25Z,1,"Hey sentdex, You dont have to specify the inputShape of layers inside your neural network, only the inputShape of the input layer is necessary. The rest will be automatically derived from the layer before it.",True
@embiem_,2018-06-18T11:18:10Z,3,Great Tutorial. I also love that you keep the sections where you don't have a clue why stuff is happening and visit the docs. Especially for beginners that gives a confidence boost ;-),True

@Lunsterful,2018-06-16T20:35:39Z,0,"Google actually use TypeScript to write their TensorFlow.Js stuff.  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and it is *amazing*, once you get your tooling and workflow set up.  Here's an example:  https://github.com/google/emoji-scavenger-hunt/tree/master/src/js",True
@benardmensah7688,2018-06-16T20:35:10Z,0,Another solid video. I have an application idea in mind please get in touch to discuss more. Am not a programmer but have years of experience in IT infrastructure/engineering,True

@mikehoops,2018-06-16T18:32:34Z,0,Why doesn't it fit as expected? Is it because tfjs is in development?,True
@Alex4n3r,2018-06-16T18:13:51Z,1,"Try LeakyReLu for one negative x value and positve ones like -1 to 3: y=3, 2.5, 0.5, 1 The fit line won't be linear due to the Leaky part. Why not do one dense layer with input:1 and output:1 with no ReLu layers at all for linear regression? BTW: Adam is trash!",True
@CJBurkey,2018-06-16T17:33:32Z,0,You didn't add a DOCTYPE declaration at the top and it's really bothering me lol,True
@Drugio24,2018-06-16T17:08:25Z,0,could it be that 128 nodes per layer were a bit too many and that caused the slower learning? what if you tried 64 or 32,True

,2018-06-16T16:19:15Z,4,"Certain JavaScript statements must be terminated with semicolons. Such semicolons may always appear explicitly in the source text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in certain situations. The most common problem caused by missing out a semicolon is with the¬†return¬†keyword. Consider this following code snippet:  var foo = function() {  var bar = 'baz'  return  {  bar: bar  }  }  console.log(foo()); Automatic semicolon insertion transform the return statement to this:  return;  {  bar: bar  }   When this code executes the output to the console is¬†undefined¬†and not the object",True

@KFGhostFace,2018-06-16T13:51:52Z,0,"You are the best SentDex! Thanks for all these amazing tutorials!  BTW: semi colons aren't enforced in JavaScript, also sometimes when your page doesn't load as expected, turn off caching in the networking tab of the developer tools",True
@GalHorowitz,2018-06-16T13:50:33Z,8,"If you even care about that, you should use the 'let' keyword instead of 'var'. var is deprecated. let was added in ES6 and so was 'const', so you if you use one it would be better to use the other. The difference is var give the variables a global scope. While let keeps normal scoping rules.",True
