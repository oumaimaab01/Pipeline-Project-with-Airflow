@hoopscoop2726,2019-12-15T13:50:30Z,0,This video series is so helpful! Thanks for all that you do.,True
@ItsRainingSteak,2019-03-11T19:48:25Z,0,kinda lost you there with the sheer copiousness of needless prints and reassignments.,True
@CarlosRoberto-vb9gi,2018-11-20T16:12:07Z,0,"Wow, es genial! Gracias Sentdex!",True
@axn5556,2018-09-24T03:36:46Z,0,Thanks very much for creating and sharing this series,True
@vsa1551,2018-04-04T05:37:50Z,0,Great video so far,True
@Palteen87,2017-12-21T04:14:36Z,1,"This example is weird because chance of success is 49 against chance of loss of 51. He makes success from 51 to 99 (inclusive both) which gives 49 units, whereas loss equals from 1 to 50 which is 50 plus ""100"" which gives 51 in total",True
@CTimmerman,2017-02-23T23:30:44Z,0,"Speaking of better, ""def rollDice(): return 100 > random.randint(1, 100) > 50"" or if you must print, simply leave out the last else as you've already returned in the False cases.",True
@gardry,2017-01-21T03:44:44Z,0,"Great series so far! Python is much more powerful than Microsoft Excel. My computer takes so long though, I need an upgrade haha",True
@abhishekparida22,2016-10-16T04:24:14Z,0,"Nice stuff. Continue the good work. Thanks a lot...  I am unable to settle whether the variable 'wager_count' depicts the no. of simulated points in a scatter plots(where certain fraction of these simulated points fall inside a credible contour say a 95% confidence interval)?  If this is the case then is it further appropriate to consider the same variable (wager_count) as some kind of time evolution(here discrete though), as if the simulated points freeze down to a mean value? Thank You in advance.",True
@bchoor,2016-07-25T15:59:38Z,0,good stuff! can't wait to see your new series on Quantopia 2.0.,True
@pungavaD,2016-05-26T07:39:57Z,0,"+sentdex  What is the configuration of your computer you are using ? A 1000 simulations of 100,000 bets takes quite less time as apparent from your video.",True
@TheYogeshkashalkar,2016-05-01T18:46:59Z,0,"hi , can i have your email ID please .want to discuss a strategy with you. but i wanna mathematics perspective on the same. thanks",True
@sethrussell5470,2015-02-21T18:30:52Z,0,"While the initial videos are informative, the python code show here doesn't actually simulate what the author purports it is simulating. Hence this video and the next few videos show simulations that are incorrect. Take a look at other simulations of the Martingale strategy and you will see that the strategy will always loose.  One reason for this simulation being incorrect is that the bettor can bet more then they posses which cannot happen in real games of chance. Another error is that the person is only broke if they have < 0, meaning that in this simulation a bettor that has 0 dollars can place any bet for any amount as determined by their wager history. There are probably some other code errors, but since it is hard to copy exactly from the video, I can't post more specifics.",True
@sdppsudheer936,2014-12-28T02:29:14Z,0,It would be better to provide the python code. Anyways thanks for the awesome videos ,True
@kevinkevinpham,2014-09-16T03:20:43Z,0,"These Monte Carlo Simulation videos are really great Harrison! Thank you for them! This exercise for learning Monte Carlo in python is such a great one.  Btw, I recently ran a similar test in excel for Roulette and think that it would be interesting if a casino aspect was added. For example, if the betting was limited for the double_bettor system..  Really appreciate your videos! Keep it up",True
@sarrtv,2014-04-06T14:06:24Z,3,"Why such an ugly code, lots of repetitions, no use of lambda functions? It makes me cringe honestly, although I do appreciate your effort.",True
