@draconwolfpack4883,2020-04-08T08:38:58Z,0,is there a discrod bot that can measure the time that people spend on discord ? for instance lets say each hour on discourd will give you 1 lvl so at the end of the month you can prise the top lvl's on the discord based on how much time they spent playing there ? :),True
@sinaasglas,2018-12-30T15:13:28Z,3,"Thanks for this, I was looking on how to create a sub function that runs every X time... couldn't find it anywhere else, being new to Async.",True
@nicholasgaylor6145,2018-10-23T03:52:12Z,0,I think it‚Äôd be pretty cool if you showed setting up a sort of game like maybe a question game about python or programming in general or anything and added like a currency system to it I saw this one bot that had pets so maybe you could like add where you can save up and by a python and feed it and you can battle other ppls pythons sort of like Pok√©mon or something similar might be cool,True
@KindRider,2018-10-19T13:59:01Z,0,this tutorial is awesome. please continue your work!,True
@HT79,2018-10-19T09:13:04Z,0,"I have a suggestion and a query: 1. Instead of Global, use a dedicated class to hold the date like sentdex_guild for example. No need to subclass the client. Just an independent class.  2. Why not run the background task from the on_ready(), instead of awaiting the until_ready. I've ran similar tasks on my bot and they work.",True
@shmarvdogg69420,2018-10-18T05:09:28Z,0,Sentdex my python had a problem with people who had special characters in their name i thought it was the encoding so i tried encoding it but that didnt work csn you do a section on handling special characters pls,True

@digitalboltwebdesign,2018-10-16T12:12:17Z,0,the best tutorials out there! anyway you might be able to do a tutorial to make the bot interact with a database like i have a website that lets people subscribe to notifications would be cool to learn how to make a discord bot authenticate and only allow people in who are in a mysql database see messages,True
@linKhehe,2018-10-16T06:16:05Z,3,Sentdex. I suggest you look into the discord.ext.commands part of discord.py,True
@1vader,2018-10-15T23:55:41Z,1,You only need to declare a variable as global if you want to set it. If you only read it you don't need the global declaration. Python will figure out that it has to be a global.,True
@JamesWattMusic,2018-10-15T18:20:14Z,0,"So the best things you can do with machine learning is to make a discod bot and have a car drive around in GTA ?    I really dont believe in regression and classification unless you have a ton of data, and then you always have the chance of it breaking down for some obscure situation.  Need to know the dynamic system equations to be sure you can predict.  Hence this entire field will burn, every scientist will know these concepts, then go back to doing what they know, science.",True
@YuKirai,2018-10-15T17:19:22Z,7,"Is there a specific reason why you use the client instead of the bot subclass? It has built in decorators to add functions as commands, specifies global command prefixes and so on. I'm really wondering why you're doing it this way.  But I love your videos and the way you explain things as always.",True

@manashejmadi,2018-10-15T14:50:35Z,0,hey sentdex please make something like an image colorizer - converting b&w images to color images. I think it would be a great tutorial and fun little project.,True
