The python implementation posted online took around 4-5 minutes per video frame!! I tried Cython and like it, but this was very complex mathematical code for me, with lots and lots of numpy arrays, etc. I couldn't make any progress with Cython. A straight Cython compile with no syntax changes sped it up a bit, but not much. Then I investigated numba. I prefer it now to Cython. I was able to optimize the program to run at about 20 seconds per frame vs 4-5 minutes! Cython makes your files incompatible with the Python interpreter, whereas with numba, you just add a few decorators on top of your functions that have CPU intensive loops. No adding of typing information, etc. Almost like magic, and it's still valid Python code, not an extension like Cython. Like Cython there are a few caveats. Classes are possible but a pain. You have to try to keep separate your loops from code that uses other modules/classes, etc. It works best if it's a lot of number crunching in tight nested loops.
