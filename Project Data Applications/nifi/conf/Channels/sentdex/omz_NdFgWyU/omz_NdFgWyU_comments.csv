One for Chapter 4 and one for Chapter 5:  Chapter 4: You say, to manually ""simulate"" a sine wave, two neurons have to be active at the same time. If one is active only, there is no effet from that output. But is that really true? Let's say the second one is active and the output of that is 1. We still have the individual weight going from second neuron to the output neuron AND the one bias of the output neuron. So it is not 1 anymore. Thus, the partially active neuron pair in the hidden layer still affects the general output of the last neuron??  Chapter 5 (much more important to me): The spiral funtion generates 100 pairs of data (x and y). 3 classes means 3 of them. So we have 300 pairs. If I do so, my first 5 results of all outputs are consistent with the book. Bu if I change to 2 classes or 1, the first 5 outputs are slightly different. That is unexpected because the first 100 should be always the same since I just reduced the amount of classes and the first class is not altered by this. It always gives constant values. Thus, my first 5 results should always be the same, but is not.  Thanks, again!",True
