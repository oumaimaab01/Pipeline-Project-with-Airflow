@jamescrowley229,2020-08-20T21:25:12Z,0,"Hi everyone. Copied the full code from pythonprogramming.net, simply does not work. First cube works perfectly, then the program just ends. I know for sure that pygame & pyopengl are installed correctly on my computer. Seems like a lot of people are having issues on this one, just continue on to the next one if you are guys, the next tutorials work ok for me anyway. btw sentdex if you see this maybe correct whatever it is that is wrong with the code on pythonprogramming.net, its v confusing when the code just doesn't work lol",True
@vigneshallam,2020-04-30T11:45:08Z,1,I think the instead of keyup or keydown U could use pygame.key.get_pressed(),True

@thrillacious,2017-06-06T01:46:56Z,0,"This key press and hold method is not currently working. I am on 3.6.1.  No errors are thrown, but no action is taking place.  I have tried adding a  keys = pygame.keys.get_pressed() along with a keys[K_UP] call with no results either...  Any suggestions?",True

@leberkassemmel,2015-02-05T20:48:04Z,2,"I HATE MY COMPUTER! REALLY! I WANNA THROW IT OUT OF MY WINDOW!  I can press my a button (because i cannot use arrow keys...) as hard as i can, and the cube does not wanna move, Even with your sample code. I do not know if i should continue with PyOpenGL and PyGame. (Yes, i had part of the problem in PyGame too, but the press-and-hold worked.) Because if something that mayor like controlls do not work, it really makes not much sense to do it.  BUT WHY???? I blame Acer (They made my Computer), Samsung (My Keyboard) and Microsoft (for Windows). Thats all.  Bye Py. I will come back when i solved the problems...  (No, restarting the Computer does not help. Reinstalling Python, Pygame and PyOpenGL does not fix it.)",True
@benjaminzupancic6961,2014-12-07T09:58:37Z,0,will you do any C# tutorials ?,True
