@dremr2038,2023-01-21T16:09:07Z,27,"If anyone stumbled across the difference between feature and label, here it is : Briefly, feature is input; label is output. This applies to both classification and regression problems.  A feature is one column of the data in your input set. For instance, if you're trying to predict the type of pet someone will choose, your input features might include age, home region, family income, etc. The label is the final choice, such as dog, fish, iguana, rock, etc.  Once you've trained your model, you will give it sets of new input containing those features; it will return the predicted ""label"" (pet type) for that person.",True

@changumangu4660,2018-09-15T06:03:47Z,1,"Please correct me if Im wrong ,ive tried to summarize the whole video.   We first found out all meaningful columns . Finding adj_close value is senseless because we already know PCT_change (which is found using adj_close) Adj_close is set as forecast_col because we are finding the value of adj_close from the future.  forecast_out specifies the number of days we have to go in future to find adj_close. forecast_out = int(math.ceil(0.01*len(df))) let len(df) be 1000 i.e we have data for 1000 days forecast_out = math.ceil(10) = 10 therefore we will be finding the adj_close value of 15th september considering today is 5th september.  df['label'] = df[forecast_col].shift(-forecast_out)  this statement is actually creating a new column as label assigning it adj_close value of the future(15th september ) and shifting it 10 rows above , so the 5th septemeber row will be having label(adj_close ) of 15th september.  I reckon we are not predicting any value , we are just finding the value existing in the database from the future row and shifting it according to forecast_out. thats why we are geting Nan values when printing the tail.(used dropna). consider last date is 25th september than so we will be getting some label values till 15th september but after that till 25th september we will get Nan.",True

When you're forecasting are you forecasting 0.01 of the dataset into the future eg the predicted value in 30 days from now or are you predicting from 1 day ahead up until you reach 0.01 of the dataset ahead eg from tomorrow until 30 days ahead ?

I get a pandas error ""During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:"" I'm running everyithing on IDLE 3.5.2 on MacOS 10.12.1 so maybe that has something to do with the error... I'm not sure because I'm relatively new to programming.  The error has to do with the forecast_col = 'Adj. Close' line When I take this line out and create the df['label] =  df['Adj. Close'].shift(-forecast_out) the output is fine and doesn't spit out an error. Is this step mostly just a coding convention that makes it more convenient to manipulate your data down the line or is this something I should resolve right now? I'd like to be able to use concise code writing conventions if it will end up making my code more readable. PS, you're a great instructor. Keep up the awesome work!",True

This tutorial was pretty hard to follow and understand, especially for people new to machine learning and maybe even programming in general. I think the  mistake you made was to sort of assume everyone knows what you know. I make this mistake alot too and it's hard to know when you are doing it.  To you everything is obvious, you've been doing this stuff for quite some time and you are very good at it. This makes you forget to explain certain things, thinking it's obvious but in reality it isn't and that makes it hard to follow along for us watching. Try to think more about this in the future.

,2016-08-14T16:44:23Z,0,"First off, great tutorial! Much appreciated!  Question: Why are we specifying the prediction time, 0.1*len(df) to be dependent on the size of the data set?  Wouldn't it make more sense to make that dependent on the resolution of the data points?  I mean, if we have minute resolution, then it would make sense to predict perhaps hourly, independently from how big our data set is. Although, the bigger the data set, the more predictions we could do.  If we have daily data points we might want to predict in daily or weekly time spans, independently from the size of our data set.  And again, the bigger span of data we have, the more predictions we could do. It would be noneffective(?) to use bigger steps just because we have more data points...  Right?     Would appreciate your thoughts. Or anybody's. :)",True
