@psbjr,2016-10-13T19:08:05Z,0,"Hi there, I just wanted to add an update to the flaskapp.wsgi touch method for updating that I commented on in the more basic flask tutorial: to further simplify this, you can actually issue a touch command on flaskapp.wsgi from WinSCP by right clicking it and selecting ""touch"" from the ""File custom commands"" menu. This can be further automated by assigning a hotkey to that command which you can set from ""Customize..."" from the same right-click context menu. I set mine to ctrl+0 so now when I update a file I just select flaskapp.wsgi in winscp and hit ctrl+0, which is much more convenient than switching over to putty imo.  Also, I just noticed this and correct me if I'm wrong, you can shorten your style tag to 'style=""margin: 5px 15px; height: 44px;"" ' and achieve the same effect (top/bottom will be 5px and right/left will be 15px)",True

@franchyze922,2015-10-30T18:13:58Z,0,"How can I edit locally, then later upload to the server? I tried to edit local but when I view my html page in chrome, it doesn't load the bootstrap styling because (I think) the python file isn't running, so it doesn't know what to do with the url_for when it gets to it.   I've been just editing my html file, then uploading and viewing to make sure everything works. I'd rather it be local so I don't have to upload and type my password in every time I want to view a change.   Thanks!",True
