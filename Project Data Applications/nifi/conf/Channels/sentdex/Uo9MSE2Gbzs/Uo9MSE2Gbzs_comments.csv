@taufiqrahman2363,2017-11-17T09:32:12Z,8,"Why use backticks (`) in struct tags? If you’re wondering why backticks (`) are used to wrap around the struct tag, remember that strings in Go are created using the double quotes ("") and backticks (`). Single quotes (') are used for runes (an int32 that represents a Unicode code point) only. You’re already using double quotes inside the struct tag, so if you don’t want to escape those quotes, you’ll have to use something else—hence the backticks.",True
