@jmahne,2016-01-21T13:24:42Z,0,"Thanks so much for this series.  I am returning ""Currently Pulling gcz16.cmx 2016-01-21 12: 50: 37 main loop time data '1453355426' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'"" having put in your fixMe codes.  Has Yahoo! changed their date format since you made this series?  I am using 2.7 version. Have I made a mistake with the following ""eachline = eachLine.replace(fixMe, str(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(int(fixMe)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')))"" ?",True

@digdra,2014-04-28T17:20:25Z,0,"A big thanks for that great tutorial of yours! I have a few question about the calculation of R. I was running the ASI on a dataset and two things happened.  First one was that the unhandled case in the calculation of R was triggered, meaning that two or more variables were equal. The result was that R was undefined.  Second thing was that R was zero which resulted into a division by zero in the main term.  Both cases could be fixed easily, but I would prefer to do it right, not just somehow. Can you recommend some literature that gives information on that special cases?",True
@jeffsnell3701,2014-01-19T07:13:14Z,1,"Thanks for the great tutorials, perfect for picking up some new skills, and as good or better than most undergrad lectures. While messing around with this fxn on some other larger data sets, it is possible for the x, y, z vars within the calc_R fxn and/or the x, y vars within the calc_K fxn to be equal, resulting in an artificially truncated dataset since there is no else condition. In either case the resulting R or K values are equal and some >= and/or <= solve the problem each time.",True
