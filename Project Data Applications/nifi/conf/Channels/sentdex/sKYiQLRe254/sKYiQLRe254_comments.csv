@kolchosenpunk2751,2018-03-10T03:14:56Z,1,"Different solution: Create an empty file called ""SomePath.pth"" in the directory where you installed Python. Then add the path into your ""SomePath.pth""-file (e.g. C:\Users\YourName\Testscripts). You can add additional pathes by simply adding a new path in a new line. Following my solution you won't have to copy your files which can be practical if your .py-files are stored in entirely different directories. Caution: said solution won't work if you run your project on a different machine! In this case you'll have to put the files into one and the same directory or create empty __init__.py-files in your project-directory and all your subdirectories if you have any.",True
