When I started doing some Python, I found that I really wanted to get good at it very quickly, but no matter where I get up to in Python, it's like there's always another thing that is unclear and so I look at it and I need to think about it and I never allow myself to feel happy that I can do some cool stuff with Python.

@LionelTellem,2016-12-11T14:03:55Z,0,"Good video, but my questions are; I watched your very early python tutorials uploads and it seems you had covered the whole python up to including the GUI part, so I wanted to know when and why did you switch to a new series of python tutorials again,Is it due to the transition from Python2.X to 3.X or you just decided to make new ones due to the new available and more sophisticated recording materials you got.  I am asking that  because I want to start my own channel too with python tutorials too for educative purposes at my faculty and follow your advice ""Don't Worry Be Hacky""  but now  that I got a small audience and basic recording materials too, should I just start by kicking off with them then later on redo a new series of the same python tutorials but with more professional material to be able to easily satisfy the bigger audience as time goes own?  Hoping to get an answer from you.Thanks in advance",True
