From what i can see it is using brushed motors, they are cheaper, but just get worse over time. This means you only got a limited flight time and if you set some fixed parameters for your motors they will change over time. This does not belong in a 200$ kit I saw on the Kickstarter that they do ship replacement motors, but I am very skeptical as a good copter can be had for half the price using brushless motors.",True
