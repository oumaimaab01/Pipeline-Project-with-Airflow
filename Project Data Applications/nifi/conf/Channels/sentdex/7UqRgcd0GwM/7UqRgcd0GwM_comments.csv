It doesn't matter how great your strat. is, if two of your three starting bots smash into each other, you're boned.  Another issue with pathfinding is how it always tries to move to the right as long as their's something intersecting with a line in the direction you plan to go.  This makes it so the bots on some maps will take a very very long path around nothing to avoid a planet pretty far away.",True
