@doyler78,2015-06-08T21:49:30Z,0,My calendar is only 4 days wide. I know that I can change the resize option to make it bigger but I have to make it huge before I get all in. I'm on Linux and have noticed from earlier that Enlarge Window text actually cuts off at Wi in Window so my guess is that the fonts being used on my Linux setup are just larger than you have on Windows but if that is the case I don't know how to resolve in any case other than a general sense that it might involve setting a global stylesheet to set the font size.,True
