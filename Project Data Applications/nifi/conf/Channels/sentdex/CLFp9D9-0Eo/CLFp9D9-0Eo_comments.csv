@polyroguegames5820,2018-12-21T19:36:15Z,0,"Huh. This doesn't work nearly as well for me, though I think it's down to the lane finder more than anything. Odd, since I used your code.  Also, I'm super confused! I can't figure out why you should go left when both m's are negative and vice versa! Surely, if both slopes are negative, i.e. going from the bottom right to the top left, it means it can't see the middle of  the road and so we're too far right, and should go left, no? And so if both are positive, we should go right?  Thank you!  EDIT: Never mind! So it was two things. One was that the values for the line threshold either are changed off cam or I just missed them, and the other is that the road really matters. I found a stretch after loads of searching that had the double yellow solid line and it worked waaaaay better than on the road I was trying. Thanks again!",True

@FeoOrozco,2017-04-30T03:47:29Z,0,I don't know anything but coding but if possible I think a good idea to find lanes would be to combine the slope Idea you came up with and somehow measure distance between the lines instead! I know some lanes are bigger than others but if you can somehow define a minimum distance that the lines have to be in order to be considered a lane then you can atleast eliminate the chance of the game thinking the 2 lines in the middle of the road is a lane and try to start driving through there,True

@fafaschiavo2,2017-04-13T01:34:58Z,68,"Nice series! I noticed that you are using only the slopes’ signs as a criteria for turning.  But if we think about the way we drive in real life, when you are driving faster you need to anticipate turns that are far from your current position. I noticed the image processing function only perceives both lines with the same sign when you are already too close from the extreme of the road.  One simple solution would be to analyze the difference between the slopes absolute values (ignoring their signs), if the difference is bigger than an acceptable value you start turning already. I noticed that would probably save your driver in 11’10’’, and I think it would work in other moments as well.  This could be done easily by simply adding another condition to your if…elif…else statement. Something like this:   acceptable_diff = 1 #i am guessing this blindly, adjust this accordingly slope_diff = abs(m1)-abs(m2)  if (m1 < 0 and m2 < 0) or (abs(slope_diff) > acceptable_diff and slope_diff > 0):  right() elif (m1 > 0  and m2 > 0) or (abs(slope_diff) > acceptable_diff and slope_diff < 0):  left() else:  straight()   I just typed this here (not the best text editor though hahahaha), but i think you got the idea.

Thank you! I've been having a lot of fun with Python this year.  1) You grayscale the image to threshold, which means you lose the difference between a white line and a yellow line. In this situation, keeping the double yellow line to the left and the white line to the right might work better. 2) Removing traffic might help. On GTA San Andreas and earlier there were codes to do that, but GTA IV and GTA V require modding to do that. 3) I was thinking about how a human would do this - we estimate our speed and position and make a mental map of our surroundings (as well as what is permenant like roads and what is movable like other cars). Is there a way for a (separate) process to use the captured images to build a 2D or 3D map? 3a) If so, can that process use the map and prediction models to guess at what actions will be necessary?

@5zazen,2017-04-11T00:55:01Z,0,Your skills are applicable to AI in real cars.  It is clear that being able to write code to guide a self driving car will soon be written.  Essentially you are doing a simpler version of that here.  Big responsibility.  I think you could do it if you have interest.,True
@ParallaxScene,2017-04-11T00:11:48Z,0,Maybe you could create some variables to store a release time for forw/left/right and just update the timestamp if you need to change it. So you could have a bit more control over the release times.,True

@jakerember,2017-04-10T23:46:45Z,0,"So, I help run a driving simulator as part of my grad program. I am by no means an expert when it comes to this specific type of situation, so take this with a grain of salt.  We only worked off of the center line and then measured how far the vehicle is from the center line. I imagine a lot more of the image could be cropped out and you could work with cleaner data.",True

@HelliOnurb,2017-04-10T23:25:48Z,0,"This is soooo cool man! I wish I wasn't on vacations so I could try it lol  I'd try using the slope values to modulate the time A & D keys get pressed, and maybe obtaining the rate of change of each of the slopes (and locating them on the screen, defining a pair of vars if on left or right of the screen maybe) to modulate the use of the S key.  Hope this ideas help a bit with the brainstorming :D",True
@PeterSeres,2017-04-10T23:14:14Z,1,"Awesome project! However I think measuring your speed is essential for any self driving algorithm. Especially if you wanna go as fast as you can.  If you wanna keep it simple it  might be possible to approximate your speed using the history of left, right and straight decisions. You can look up or manually see how much acceleration a W   produces (I assume it's constant for a scooter) and you can also measure manually the deceleration of the scooter in idle mode. Since you know how much time every loop takes, you can always just say V += dv *dt and keep this going until you completly stop. It's a rough estimate but it's not graphical and at least the AI will know if it's going slow or fast.",True
@wuda-io,2017-04-10T23:00:09Z,0,you could do a pulse width modulation for the speed.  so you give as input a percentage of w-keypress and pause ratio,True
@harley4007,2017-04-10T22:27:00Z,0,"When the slope of a line (lane) is too great, then make it so that the key is held down rather than releasing it very fast and pressing it down again. Also, release W while doing making these sharp turns. If a line is perpendicular to you, then you may want to slow down. I don't know python, but by watching, it seems that you could do something simpler. However, I believe slopes are everything in this, so use them to predict where a turn might occur as well. Since computers can process information extremely fast, use that to your advantage and create a whole bunch of different circumstances with turns and objects on the roads, and what the car should do when it goes off the road.   Oh yeah—note that it is important that when you turn, you must not only turn (press A) but also press W. this will prevent you from getting stuck.   As you program, think of a simple solution. There is always a more efficient way of doing things. ",True
@JasonWhittle1,2017-04-10T22:10:34Z,0,"this was great fun to watch. maybe log how quickly the gradients change, and if they change quickly tell it to slow down because a fast change in gradient would indicate a sharp turn (or a not so sharp turn if you're going really fast)",True
@qli880,2017-04-10T21:48:23Z,0,"If you want to apply the PID controller, you might need to find a way to measure the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the scooter in the game world. Great vid btw.",True

@faizrasool7990,2017-04-10T20:37:16Z,1,Why you don't just take 2 most lengthy lines and ignore other lines? it can reduce your big function(draw_lanes) to just couple of lines?,True

@jedrus1997,2017-04-10T18:00:59Z,0,There might be an option to connect xbox controller and set thrust to one of the triggers. Then you are not accelerating in binary system (pressed/non pressed) but you can accelerate by specific value from 0 to 1. Like in real life driving :),True
