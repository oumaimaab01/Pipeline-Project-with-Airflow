@veggiet2009,2018-06-26T20:39:11Z,1,"These videos are really cool, but this one I don't get, it appears that concat and append do the same thing, but in a slightly different manner, concat creating a new dataframe out of N number of dataframes and append simply adding one to another one. The questions I'm left with are: When would you use this? When would you prefer one over the other? Is there a collective preference among the pandas community (similar to the 'import pandas as pd' phrase) ?",True

@sdoken,2017-07-26T15:28:11Z,0,Thanks a lot sentdex. Question:  What you are doing at 6:01 seems a bit weird to me. You are appending a Series to a Dataframe. Yes it works and everything so obviously it is not wrong but most people think of pandas dataframe as tables and Series as a Column. Am I Wrong? So treating this Series s as a new *row* to a dataframe is kind of counterintuitive to me and makes me feel weird inside lol.  I had never seen series used that way but I guess they can be. Is it okay if I think of this as a special gimmick in python and continue to think if Series as columns? Thanks for all your work sentdex.,True
