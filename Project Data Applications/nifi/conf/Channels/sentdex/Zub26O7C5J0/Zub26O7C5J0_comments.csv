@-._,2018-12-02T17:03:18Z,0,"I know this hasn't really to do with the video, but I can't find a solution to my problem: I'm trying to make an RNN that also has Conv2D at the start in Keras. I used adam optimizer and everything but the LSTM cells are TimeDistributed. It should track the velocity of a dot, but the loss won't go down. The problem is a bit to big to explain in full detail here, so if you would like to help me on this, I will explain it better. Thanks",True
@Keksmania,2018-12-02T16:51:09Z,0,Not sure how much Data I should collect and how it will effect my model for an initial model. A threshold of 4200 halite should be enough to do something more meaningful than random right?,True
@alkhashtee,2018-12-02T16:41:38Z,0,You are amazing my friend,True
@henningsperr8063,2018-12-02T12:49:27Z,5,"Hey great series! I am super excited to see how it will turn out, since I had a similar setup in mind but just don't have a GPU or anything. So I stuck with a Rule based bot, which made it into the top 100 at least :)  Anyway, some stuff was already said but some feedback:  - Two or more ships colliding can drop more than 1000 Halite on one spot, MAX_HALITE is just the max amount that can spawn and or be carried by a ship. - If two ships collide on top of your dropoff or shipyard the halite will be collected for you. Its a common end game strategy to smash all your ships together to collect the rest. I am super curious to see if your network learns that eventually. - You can get turns left with: turns_left = constants.MAX_TURNS - game.turn_number and use this in maybe a bit more reliable way. - I am not a NN professional but I think you should at least set the value for ships to 1 even if they are empty, otherwise your network will not be able to know where obstacles are if there are empty ships around.  - Not sure its a good idea but to better compare your experiments you may want to manually set a seed and make sure every time you build the training data you put the same seeds. This way you can be sure that you got better and the next generation is not just better because of easier maps. (You may then overfit the set though so depending on how many examples you plan generating going forward) - you called it ship_friend_or_fow :)  I am super excited to see where this is going and am looking forward to more videos.",True
@BabitaDevi-dx2ro,2018-12-02T00:09:03Z,0,I learned Python from your learn Python 3 and intermediate Python then what should I watch next,True
@Alex4n3r,2018-12-01T13:04:03Z,0,Pretty interesting if the NN learns that the random choice might have been wrong due to lack of fuel and that the ship has to do a force-collect.,True
@theoutstander,2018-12-01T01:30:50Z,1,"Instead of matplotlib histograms, you should check out seaborne.distplot(). It graphs a kde on top of a histogram and looks really nice. I use it a lot.",True
@koms8323,2018-12-01T01:16:47Z,0,Hello harry! You are Awesome  I want yo learn Artificial intelligence  What would you suggest me  I learned Python from your series,True
@oasdfe1691,2018-11-30T21:49:25Z,3,This is very interesting to me. I'm a big data science guy and I don't use any machine learning since my analysis doesn't ever need it. Or maybe I just don't understand machine learning enough to to use itm,True
