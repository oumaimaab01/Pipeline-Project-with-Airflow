@thefamousdjx,2018-06-02T06:55:23Z,1,I'm very thankful for the time you dedicate in providing such detailed knowledge. You clearly understand the mind of a beginner as all your tutorials always touch on all the little questions that curious beginners might have. I used to find it annoying designing user interfaces and just about 2 months back I learnt from one of your tutorials how easy it is to create interfaces with the QT Designer. Now I've been getting more and more side projects and $$$$$ all because of the ability to knock out a user interface within minutes and present a quick demo to prospective clients.  I'm hoping you will create one more tutorial on threading using QThread in PyQt as usually the interface always freezes when a big calculation is running. I'm struggling to understand any of the tutorials online which are based on interfaces that have been created from scratch and not with Qt designer. Thank you,True

I use python to make use of BOM data, PCB tested boards data, a bit of fun machine learning with halite. If you went more in depth with image recognition would be useful.. such as identify more detail.. as I want to be able to use image recognition detect PCB faults in production/assembly.  At the end of the day.. Good job sentdex! you should do a Q&A or meet up some point, I'm in San Diego in June if you wanted to meet up from texas? bit far!",True
