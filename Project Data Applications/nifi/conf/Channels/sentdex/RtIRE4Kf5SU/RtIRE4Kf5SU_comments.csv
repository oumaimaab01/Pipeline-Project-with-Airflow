Do you know which of these CPUs will perform better in machine learning and data science tasks, no need to say I would use a Nvidia GPU like 3070 besides the cpu, but I wanna choose an appropriate cpu for these types of tasks. These are my choices: 1. 5900X:       $250 (used) 2. 13600KF:   $400 (used) 3. 13700KF:   $500 (new) But as you know there is another  important factor,  GPU. if I choose the 5900x then I could spend the extra money on a better GPU. If I wanna summarize both CPU and GPU configuration I afford are these three options: 1. 5900X + 3080Ti 2. 13600KF + 3070Ti 3. 13700KF + 3060 / 3060Ti  which one should be a better combination?",True

Then a 3rd person joined the discussion commenting how things will change in 5 years. My friend and I just had to laugh and say that ""nope, what you talk about is already here"". I think this (as history shows us) is the case where those who do prototyping, can forsee better what's to come and thus place bigger bets on which directions to focus on. Strangely enough, my friend was always a advocate for AR and myself for VR, so we laughed again as we realised our paths are crossing again as we exchange our project developments with Ai in the last few months.
