@josephturi,2016-10-11T00:48:25Z,0,Hi sentdex! What model of keyboard are you using? The key strokes sound awesome.,True
@sohaibarif2835,2016-10-08T05:34:52Z,3,"Alexnet is now quite old now but this was the network that made neural networks popular again in 2012. It is famous for winning the ImageNet 2012 competition. Now, one of the best ones is Inception v4 but I am not sure if the whole network is available. Fun fact, people still use the variable name fc7 when referring to fully connected layers to a conv layer due to the convention set in Alexnet where it was the 7th layer. This is despite networks today being 100s of layers (although, I did read some stuff about moving towards wide instead of deep networks meaning this could decrease) and fc7 clearly not being the 7th layer.",True
@jnscollier,2016-10-07T16:17:02Z,0,I'll build a library that wraps around all the machine learning libraries. Then someone will come along and build a library that wraps around mine and others. Then someone else will come along and ...,True
@ErrorDebug,2016-10-06T19:49:28Z,0,"Will you do some starter python programs? I watched all your Python 3 Basics Tutorial Series and i still dont really know what to do with python. I mean something without pygame, django...these seem very advanced and on web there is not much videos about programming in python like some small useful programms.....there is just explanations for bigginers.",True
@stew9671,2016-10-05T20:19:02Z,0,"Hi, i have a question, but it's not rly related to this theme but to python.  A friend of mine also wants to learn python, but he can't install it. It just says an error message for him with no details for the error. After i googled it it said you'll need windows service pack 1, wich he has installed after i told him. But now it still doesn't work. What could couse the error. (Don't ask for details i don't know them myself, but i know that he uses Windows 64 bit)",True
@BoIoko,2016-10-05T03:38:26Z,2,"Thanks again, man. I just watched the whole series and haven't gone to the tensorflow website tutorials yet, but I thought it would be interesting if you, at the end of each method, draw some handwritten number and make it tell what number it is.",True
@kevinz1777,2016-10-04T22:29:49Z,1,AlexNet was divided into 2 streams like that because at the time he couldn't fit the whole batches into a single GPU. Think he released a paper on this sort of model parallelism. https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997 if you're interested :) Great video by the way as always.,True
@johncusack3646,2016-10-04T17:59:07Z,0,generative adversarial networks would be interesting,True
@VictorGallagherCarvings,2016-10-04T16:13:53Z,0,"Ok, now I have got it. I thought convolutional layers had to be handled differently.",True
