@MrHatoi,2019-10-13T18:57:58Z,0,You should use integer division so you don't have those crazy decimals. That would help the network a lot.,True
@casewhite5048,2018-05-15T13:40:48Z,0,"would it ever be possible to combined the word/language / maths learning systems to eventually solve/recognise word problems and solve them for example ""Two trains leave Chicago, Illinois, traveling in the same direction along parallel tracks. The first train leaves 3 hours before the second, and its speed is 15 miles per hour faster than the second. Find the speed of each train if they are 270 miles apart 3 hours after the second train leaves Chicago.""",True

@bartoszpaternoga5522,2018-04-25T09:37:12Z,0,"Hi Harrison,  TensorFlow.js  has been released. We can use the TensorFlow code  with any JavaScript web app.  We can also use pretrained models and convert them to TensorFlow.js . It seams that ML powered web apps are just behind the corner and it is potentially v good business. Would you create a dedicated tutorial series for ML and javascript?",True

@MackTheTemp1,2018-04-23T02:27:40Z,0,"I think your model could be improved by providing an elementary training set where the training data only has ints 0-100. Given that you're trying to train the neural net to 'learn math' consider that humans have seperate neural processes for estimating the multiplication / addition of numbers and actually calculating them. They they take different amounts of energey/time for our brains and are located in different areas of the brain -- Thinking Fast and Slow.  I believe there are axiomatic first principles of math that the bot will never imagine if it's trying to guess what the product of two huge numbers is in a nano second before checking it's reward status. If you think about the data we consume when learning math, it's highly curated.",True

@Eurley66,2018-04-19T11:41:17Z,0,"What if you trained the model on increasingly complex data -- That is to say, begin with 1 char numbers, then 2, etc. up to 5. Maybe the model would learn the operations? I'm also curious to know if families of neurons activate given a specific operation or order of operations. What if the loss function the model was trying to minimize was an absolute difference function instead of a least squares one? So much questions flow when dealing with these! I'll try and do some research with my own models with basic mathematics, it feels like digging and getting more and more comprehension of the models doing so. Anyway, very impressive to see the model get so close results, given how big the numbers are.",True
@aneeshaneesh4275,2018-04-18T13:25:52Z,0,Hi . I am installing kivy on ubuntu but after installation it is giving importing error . please help me it is wasting my so much time.,True
@_petrok,2018-04-18T10:08:00Z,0,I really like the idea of a computing nn. But is there any way to make an error estimation? The model could be bad at generalizing - an approximation error is fine as long as I know how bad it could possibly become.,True
@polares8187,2018-04-17T19:55:15Z,2,Can we train different neural networks for every operator and create another neural network which learns the proper order of operations of wanted calculations. Based on the order of operation our neural network provides we can use the operator networks to do the computation. Might be interesting to try.,True
@Iwantyoudie1995,2018-04-17T19:11:53Z,0,"I'm wondering if we could use the difference between the expected output number and the output of the network (treated as a float) as the loss function used in training. I mean, I'm guessing that the model is using some sort of character-wise loss function (I didn't study this model), but probably a loss function that takes in account the real purpose that is to minimize the difference can help.  However i'm not an expert, it was more a doubt than an advice.",True
@_jelle,2018-04-17T19:07:50Z,0,"You're asking it to predict 17 digit numbers, maybe you should just let it predict the 8 or so most significant digits to give it more of a chance. Something of the form 1.2345678e+9 instead of 1234567801.23456789. I also think the fact that it's training just as hard on the 17th digit as it does on the 1st digit might be a problem, that could just be adding noise to your training because it's never going to learn to get the 17th digit right anyway.",True

@dippatel1739,2018-04-17T14:04:42Z,3,use learning rate 0.1 for a longer time and then decay it after 50k or 40k epochs. It should make much faster learning in the initial stage.,True
