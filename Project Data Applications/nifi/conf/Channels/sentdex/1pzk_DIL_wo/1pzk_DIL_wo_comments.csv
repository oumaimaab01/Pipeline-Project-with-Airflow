@koober_,2017-12-26T21:21:50Z,10,"Great tutorial! Only had one problem understanding the parameters to the img[] list, but I think I've got it now for anyone who may also be confused.  Say you have the coordinates (100,200) as the top left of a box, and (300,400) as the bottom right. If you wanted to select the region bound by those coordinates, you would have img[200:400, 100:300]. Note that the two Y-coordinates come first, while the X-coordinates come after. As for copying and pasting it in the top left corner, you'd then use the change in coordinate values by subtracting: 400-200 = 200 for the Y, and 300-100 = 200 for the X, resulting in img[0:200, 0:200]. I think you could adjust where the copied part ends up by appropriately modifying these coordinates (i.e. you wouldn't start from 0, but rather x and y units from one of the other corners).   As a side note, the coordinates are oriented with respect to the top left corner of the image. The column values (x-coords) go from left to right, while the row values (y-coords) go from top to bottom.",True
