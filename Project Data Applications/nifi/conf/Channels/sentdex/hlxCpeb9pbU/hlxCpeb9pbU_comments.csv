@koolkid54100,2022-07-06T20:50:15Z,0,i know this video is old so i probably wont get any reply but why would you want to have a script that does different things if its run in main or used as a module? why not just created two scripts one to be used as a module and one to be used as a main and then import the module only script if it is needed in the run as main script? it just seems messy and unorganized when you could just make two different scripts to do the same thing and it would be much more clear and organized and run the same.,True

@craigwarren4123,2019-05-06T00:24:04Z,0,"Hi Harrison, Series is great. Think some may find the explanation of name == main ... a tad confusing. Now, this is just a suggestion for a tutorial rewrite .....  Use the (if __name__ == '__main__': # do something),if you want to run code in your module, that will exclusively run, only when you are directly running your module as someFileNamedotpy versus running your module by way of importing it into another file as in.. import someFileName...              Keep up the great work, it is very much appreciated.",True
@fupopanda,2019-01-07T01:55:54Z,12,"This tutorial is your worst in this series so far; probably the only bad one. You essentially skipped the explanation of what ___name___ means.  *For those very new to Python,* ___name___ is a special variable that Python declares before running a module. A module is just another name for a Python file. When a module is run, the variable ___name___ is set to the string ___main__._ If a module is being imported into the main module that is running, the variable ___name___ of the imported module is set to its own name.",True

@AdlerWeber,2016-02-11T19:57:12Z,0,"+sentdex For some reason I can't import and run the class, I have both files in the same directory. One of them is called ""colorsorting"" and the other ""classtest"". ""colorsorting"" works on its own and I have a copy of main() in the class ""color"". Whenever I attempt to import colorsorting, ""import colorsorting"", and run the function, ""colorsorting.color()"", it only creates a folder in the same directory titled ""__pychache__"" with a compiled python file of colorsorting.py (titled colorsorting.cpython-34).

@ScottDonald78,2015-02-06T13:05:03Z,0,sentdex could you say that 'If name equals main' means that if the module name appears in the file you are running then it will activate and use that module? Just trying to get my head around the concept.,True
