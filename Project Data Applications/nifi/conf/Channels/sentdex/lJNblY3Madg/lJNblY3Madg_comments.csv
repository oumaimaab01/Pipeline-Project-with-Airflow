Also, sometimes GPT-4 seems to have a negative attitude when I write articles about GPT and ask it for correction or translation. GPT 4 sometimes ignores my request and instead comments on the text CONTENT itself, saying that ""As an AI, I cannot blabla"". This behavior can be annoying, and I have to carefully reread the corrected text as sometimes it would even alter the statement in the text about GPT itself. I don't see it as ""sparks of consciousness"" but rather some sort of manually adjusted behavior by the programming team. All in all, I prefer GPT-3.5 for all language-related work, while I use GPT-4 for complex tasks that require a more differentiated presentation of data (creating list tables, etc.).",True

Maybe I just dismissed it because it was just short of being ready but these outputs wouldn't have been useful for any application. I can't really tell whether they had a good understanding of the input text you gave, but I feel like that part has just skyrocketed in gpt 3. I mean yeah, the technology is probably still the same, but gpt 3 can understand seemingly all human situations and always knows how to react. Of course the recent hype is because of chat which just made it insanely accessible but for me personally the point where I really thought wow this has potential for so many of my ideas was gpt 3, it was just hard to realize them with the regular api.  edit: but yes I do agree the whole agi thing is just to much of the marketing and far from reality and I also agree that gpt 4 doesn't seem that much better than 3 besides the token limit",True

You should check bens presentation of the paper on youtube.

Also with all those fixes to alignment problems the performance of the model got reduced. Try to draw a unicorn in tikz now. It cant do it like in the paper anymore.

@Christian-op1ss,2023-04-30T17:03:57Z,6,"Hi @sentdex, I found 4.0 much better at coding problems than 3.5. I use both for coding extensively. Some differences I found: - 4.0 hallucinates a lot less - Related, 4.0 often told me something is not possible while 3.5 writes gibberish - 4.0's ability to take in large texts allows you to just paste in an API, and then it gets pretty much perfect at code (coding tip for working with it) - 3.5 simply makes more coding mistakes. I usually start with 3.5 since it is faster, then when I get errors I transfer the problem to 4.0, which then often avoids those same errors - 4.0 is a lot more nuanced in its answers, and less generalistic  However, if there is a LOT of examples online already for what you are doing with 3.5, then the benefit of using 4.0 goes way down.

And the non-GPT models have all been trained on GPT 3.5 or 4 prompting, so they're going to embed some of the concept space that exists in the GPT lineage, which is their biggest strength (at least known publicly) imo.   As for confidence, supposedly the confidence effects are actually a result of the RLHF. Pre-RLHF models were much more capable at estimating their own confidence, but we've essentially gaslit them into doubting themselves.

@nano7586,2023-04-28T22:18:38Z,0,"30:57 I was also curious to see if ChatGPT has a random number generator and well, it wasn't super accurate. Telling it to ""Draw me 80 samples from a normal distribution with mean 10 and stdev 5."" (generated these values by ""thinking"" and no packages or thelike) gave me values that result in a mean of 9.23 and a stdev of 3.15, which I'm 99% certain is not a large deviation by chance but the result of its inability. I also asked it to draw 80 more and performed a t-test and F-test to see if both samples equal in terms of mean and stdev - they don't. The values also didn't look super normally distributed in a histogram. But it's still impressive that it is capable of producing something.",True

Also anyone reading this may want to check out the study on 'Rozado’s Visual Analytics' where it is demonstrated that chatGPT is far left on almost all political topics.

Their English was usually not perfect but pretty decent. But when I checked their German or Spanish, it was usually bad, really bad. I'm a bit of a grammar nazi and have not once seen a single grammar or orthographic mistake in German, Spanish or English with chatGPT. What's more, my gf is a native Bosnian speaker and on the admittedly few examples she saw, she was certain that it did not contain any mistakes whatsoever.  I mean, you can't tell me Bosnian was high on their priority list.  With these newest language models it seems that language correctness in itself is completely solved (or at least 99.9%)...",True

We can create a dataset containing ALL possible scenarios and train a model and it will destroy everything 2. LLMs can be quite sensitive to input prompts, could this be an indicator that the model rather remembered all the patterns than understood the language and logic behind it 3. it's suspicious that they report multimodal samples only related to explaining jokes. I'd imagine there will be plenty of reddit meme posts with people asking why it's funny and other people explaining.
