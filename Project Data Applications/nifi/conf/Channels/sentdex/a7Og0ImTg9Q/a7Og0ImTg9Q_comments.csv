@olfmombach260,2018-04-04T20:09:05Z,0,So my understanding of recurrent neural networks is that they have an inner state that gets updated for each step that the network gets an input and processes it (and manipulates its state). So why do we have to specify a sequence length that can't be changed anymore throughout the code? Because then we could just feed every input one by one and the network would theoretically have memory about every single one of the prior inputs. WIth a fixed sequence length you would only have memory about the other items in the sequence. So why do we have to use the sequence method then? Is it because of training?,True

@easyBob100,2018-04-04T17:18:31Z,0,"One thing you might want to look at are GANs with control signals.  If you want it to output more than gibberish, give it something that can give it some more direction.  For example, you could give a GAN many different paintings, but with a second array (most likely one hot encoded) that tells the generator (as well as discriminator) what style the painting is.  That way you can control the style of the generated images.",True

@bartoszpaternoga5522,2018-04-04T15:31:56Z,0,"Hello Harrison, you said at the end: ""next tutorial will be about teaching Generative Model write python code"" Hate to spoil it,  but it is not possible to have DL writing a code for you: “…, you could not train a deep-learning model to read a product description and generate the appropriate codebase. That’s just one example among many. In general, anything that requires reasoning—like programming or applying the scientific method—long-term plan- ning, and algorithmic data manipulation is out of reach for deep-learning models, no matter how much data you throw at them. Even learning a sorting algorithm with a deep neural network is tremendously difficult. This is because a deep-learning model is just a chain of simple, continuous geometric transformations mapping one vector space into another. All it can do is map one data manifold X into another manifold Y, assuming the existence of a learnable continuous transform from X to Y. A deep-learning model can be interpreted as a kind of pro- gram; but, inversely, most programs can’t be expressed as deep-learning models—for most tasks, either there exists no corresponding deep-neural network that solves the task or, even if one exists, it may not be learnable: the corresponding geometric transform may be far too complex, or there may not be appropriate data available to learn it.”  – françois chollet – in a book “Deep learning with Python” (keras creator)",True
