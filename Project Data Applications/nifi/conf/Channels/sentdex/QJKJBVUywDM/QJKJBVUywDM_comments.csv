@ngjun6832,2017-11-30T06:56:50Z,0,"Hi sentdex, can you explain to me what is the logic / algorithm behind the code you have written?                      if not starting_stock_value: #create a condition to assign starting_stock_value to stock price                         starting_stock_value = stock_price                      if not starting_sp500_value: #sames goes to SP500 value                         starting_sp500_value = sp500_value  Why the value of starting_stock_value will show only the first row of price value in every company?",True
@charles3450,2017-09-07T15:56:02Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, huge thanks for these tutorials - they're great. I have a question: can you think of a meaningful way to do a comparable analysis of the crypto currency market given the relative lack of data?  A crypto price-correlation can be seen here but nothing too interesting came out. https://www.kaggle.com/dbarkhorn/crypto-correlation/comments",True
@mrinalmahajan6471,2017-07-30T09:52:01Z,0,"how are you getting files in sorted order according to its date with os.listdir(), it gives an arbitrary list rather than a sorted one, kindly suggest smthing else. I tried os.walks() but its giving error in datetime functions saying string required not file.",True
@yash41237605,2016-12-23T17:27:45Z,0,"When i execute the code, it takes like 10 minutes to execute it and make my graph. I have an i7-5th gen (laptop) with 8 gb of ram, and the Allocated heap size is some 500 mb. Why is it so? How can i help this? My project interpreter is Anaconda3, could that be significantly slowing it down? because i see all packages are installed. Or could there be any other reason? Please help as im really confused about how to proceed if it takes SO long to execute.",True
@zwang5472,2015-11-20T03:06:50Z,3,"problem with your percentage change: should be like this: starting_sp500_value = sp500_value sp500_value = float(row[""Adjusted_Close""]) ... sp500_p_change = (sp500_value-starting_sp500_value)/starting_sp500_value",True
@bruete6,2015-09-29T21:22:00Z,0,"percentage change should be ""similar"" to derivative.  When you calculate the percentage change, the old value is a fixed value, which is the price of the earliest one.  It makes sense to me that percentage change = (today  price -  newest last price)/newest last price. Basically,  update the old price in file loop.",True
@haopengliu,2015-05-28T08:15:21Z,2,should percentage change = (today's price - yesterday's price)/yesterday's price? which is used for calculate stand deviation.,True
