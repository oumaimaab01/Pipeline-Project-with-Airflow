Second : I am learning python for a while using your videos and I'm here to learn this one . Btw when I try to get the number of workers it is a little confusing . For example at the right upper corner of screen you have 15/15 but your given workers amount by self.workers.amount is less than this . Self.workers.amount not including the workers that building an structure! Self.units(SCV).amount or len(Self.units(SCV)) is not different!  What can I do to get all workers amount ? Thanks again,True
