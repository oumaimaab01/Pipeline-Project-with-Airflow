@ConorFenlon,2020-04-24T19:12:22Z,5,"When you explain that the string ""I want to play a game"" is immutable, and that the print(game) within the  function definition results in ""A game"". Is what's happening here related to 'scope'? It's a term I was introduced to while programming in C++. Basically, the scope of the function determines the control of only the variables within that function. They can't be changed from outside the function, and the function can't change variables outside of itself, due to the effects of it's scope. Is that why you call the ""I want to play a game"" string immutable? Or is it a separate concept?",True

@brotherlui5956,2018-11-04T22:09:01Z,47,"Hi, sorry to say but your explanation of accessing and changing outside variables inside functions is not correct. You are mixing object mutability and variable scope. This is misleading.",True

@TheSaver23,2018-11-02T22:39:22Z,3,"good stuff mate, i just started learning python like 2 days ago (coming from ADF/android development background ) and your videos are just different and more exciting to watch and learn from than other sources, i just want u to know this is the best tutorials ive seen on youtube, i usually check youtube for the topics i wanna learn and find nothing that much valuable and get back to learning from the good old docs, but this is actually entertaining and informative at the same time, thank you so much for your work <3 keep em coming.",True
@lank_asif,2018-11-02T20:44:41Z,41,"sentdex   I particularly loved this tutorial, partly because it was longer but mostly because of the way you took the time to outline and exhibit a common but tricky to grasp topic. Thanks again for all your hard work and dedication to helping those that need it. Cheers!",True
@cicciobombo7496,2018-11-02T20:28:21Z,4,"This is why python REALLY needs a declaring variable sytanx.   The problem of ""why isn't this being changed"" is because python thinks you are declaring a new variable inside the function since by default it doesn't access global variables. Of course you can't declare a variable when using the [ ] operator, so it will try to find a global variable for that.  With a keyword like ""let"" it would be crystal clear what is being created or accessed, and the interpreter could yell at you if you try to access a global variable without saying it, instead of silently creating a new one",True
@edster512,2018-11-02T19:53:38Z,1,"I found this video slightly confusing, why not just say a string literal is immutable and a list is mutable, then give some simple examples of each, then explain how scope works and explain how that can break your code.Like your videos a lot, just felt I needed to speak up on this one though haha",True
@hawkeyezar5779,2018-11-02T19:46:41Z,26,"Love your videos dude, not sure why people complain about premiere. Think some people just have nothing to do but complain and cry. You are one of the few youtubers that don't flood my screen with ads. So having to wait and extra day to watch your videos is worth it.  People are just so ungrateful for the free knowledge that you provide. I bet you these are the same people that use ad block for youtube ads on other channels.",True
