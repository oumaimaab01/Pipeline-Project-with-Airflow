@anuragreddy2905,2020-06-26T03:10:40Z,1,@sentdex what do you think about imputing missing values with KNN rather than mean/median etc,True
@shot8136,2020-04-13T00:17:38Z,0,nice video,True
@SayanSahamessi10,2019-11-11T18:57:03Z,0,One thing I would like to add is that KNN is not trained. All of the data is kept and used during prediction time.,True
@dhruvpathi941,2019-09-12T13:42:47Z,0,is this algorithm the same as kernals ??,True
@thefamousdjx,2019-08-21T08:51:41Z,0,"Hi, any ideas why sometimes standardization is used for K-nearest neighbors?  If KNN is all about relative distances, then that should always hold and its to be  expected that the variable with the larger ranges will influence more, but the distances will be exactly what they have to be so why cant they just be used that way. Really struggling with understanding this. Thanks",True

@changumangu4660,2018-09-30T04:55:23Z,11,In case of 3 groups  k=5 can still lead to split ( 2 - 2 - 1) How to classify now ? should we consider the class with point  that has the minimum distance as the result of clasifficaton,True
@seennnun2895,2018-09-18T04:15:48Z,1,"for two groups, lets say, a and b, then the k is three cuz u can get aab or abb to get conclusion but for three groups, a, b, c, if k is 5, then u may have aabbc right? then can it work?",True

@kobaltauge,2017-09-09T05:48:57Z,2,"Hi. Saw so many videos about KNN, but this one is the first to clarify the functionality in a simple way.  Thank you very much! Your a great instructor. Greetings from Germany.",True
@janiobachmann5029,2017-07-29T21:14:29Z,3,"Nice tutorials Sentdex! Slowly but surely I am grabbing all this information. The reason why most people tend to have difficulties learning all this is because you have to learn Python programing + Statistics (At least the essentials). Your tutorials are super awsome and people have to have the will to research the different concepts. Anyways, Thanks for all the help sir because of you I have a greater knowledge! Greetings from the Dominican Republic.",True

@harshnigam3385,2017-01-02T19:32:11Z,4,Sir i came here after taking an ml course on corsera ( Andrew Ng) to learn scikit and python lib and also to improve on implementation. I have realized that there is a lot of  difference bw the algorithms you have taught and the ones in that course. So are there different implementations in academia  and industry or people have their own versions of algo?,True
@asadkhan-cm4mj,2016-05-14T09:13:05Z,1,Hey mate!I want to develop a web application for Prediction of Different disease using machine learning algorithm.I done  this in PHP but I want to do this in Python  using Django Framework.I am newbie How do I start this if you have any example regarding this please provide the link.thanks,True
@averyscott7504,2016-05-01T11:25:48Z,0,"These videos are great.  So many other tutorials assume a base set of knowledge but you're doing an excellent job of explaining things from the start.  I have a couple of questions.  My apologies in advance if you're covering them in a different video:  1) I'm guessing you want to normalize your features/dimensions so a single dimension with a big difference doesn't dominate the total distance between two points.  Is that right?  2) If (1) is correct, is there a type of ""training"" you can do to normalize each dimension differently?  I realize this is contrary to the meaning of normalize, but I was just thinking of it as a way of weighting a certain feature more than others.  For example, if you had 3 features, and you guessed that Feature 2 was twice as important as Feature 1 and Feature 3, your min-max range vector for the 3 features could be something like [0-1, 0-2, 0-1] respectively.",True

@minecraft4life525,2016-04-30T14:08:17Z,1,Hey mate! Following every tutorial with interest. With inspiration from you I started working on a script to classify text (webpages to be exact) and I was wondering if you can point me towards a tutorial you have on the topic or if you're making such a tutorial in the near future?,True
