@Ragatokk,2018-12-22T10:40:35Z,0,"Hello, I was wondering why not make the AI completely random, then fight itself to learn? (maybe max 1 action per second, at least to benign with) Is it possible to assign colors automatically? type terrain getting 0, x , y then for  player 1 you get 1, x, y then for player 2  you get 2, x, y...  I was thinking maybe 100 games per generation, you would then take the 100 winners, pair them up against each other with some pseudo random algorithm making all of the 100 winners fight twice so you get another 100 games for the current generation. (After a while we should probably try to introduce some bots for it to fight against as well)",True

@OusamaEsbel,2018-07-14T16:54:22Z,0,Very nice tutorial.. I haven't seen the data but I bet it is imbalance dataset and I think that you should try other metrics like f1 score to know how well is your model is doing,True

@sibyjoseplathottam4828,2018-07-14T00:15:27Z,1,Please try to use tf.datasets. In tf version 1.9 they added support for it in keras model.fit(). So you can directly use dataset instead of a Numpy array,True

@vmokrousov,2018-07-13T18:12:39Z,0,Maybe some reinforcement learning?,True
@Anton-wz4yg,2018-07-13T18:01:59Z,4,"You should not use max pooling or any pooling layers in your network. The translational invariance that they offer is something you actually want to avoid: your network wants to know where EXACTLY the buildings, agents etc. are. Check the DQN architecture for example. I know that you are not using reinforcement learning techniques to train, but the same theory applies on the deep networks as in RL. Also dropout has not shown to be useful in reinforcement learning. You kind of want to overfit on the environment that you train on, so from the theory dropout does not make sense. I have not tested myself whether they impede performance, so I might be wrong here. So to make it as simple as possible I would just remove dropout and max pooling layers.",True

@tonanornottonull7132,2018-07-13T14:35:38Z,4,"Have to say, I just discovered you a couple weeks ago, and I'm hooked haha I'm a Java guy, but I've programmed professionally in Python before and these tutorials are by far the most concise and informative tutorials I've found. Haven't seen any from you, but I don't know if you'd want to tackle a basic 6502 emulator tutorial series in Python to help folks understand how Python could be used as a stepping stone for people interested in hardware and systems design in making interpreted and dynamically recompiled emulators. Anyways, ramble over. Good work!",True

I was thinking maybe using Json files then load specific language variable e.g ""en-GB.json"", ""en-US.json""? is that a bad way to do it?.",True
