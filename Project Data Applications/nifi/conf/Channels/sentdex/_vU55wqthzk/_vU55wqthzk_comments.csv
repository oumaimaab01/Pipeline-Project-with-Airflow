@SimonKlimekNetwork,2019-01-02T23:51:12Z,0,"I follow your arm project from the beginning, would it be better to use Hough Circles to detect puk in all shades of color ?Â I currently using your code for robot competition http://www.eurobot.org/eurobot/eurobot-2019 would you mind me to use your code customised to our different arm/ gripper?",True
@yusufozer266,2018-06-04T11:23:20Z,0,Are you using opencv with CUDA? or only CPU?,True
@Jack-ei1tn,2018-05-29T15:00:21Z,0,"Have you ever thought about doing a series on implementing classic data structures (linked lists, hash tables, trees, etc.) in python and their applications?",True
@echnaton4989,2018-05-29T14:06:01Z,0,"I agree with sentdex on the part of starting programing. I first was introduced to C++ and I had a really though time understanding how to write code, because it's that close to the machine. Now I'm learning Python and it's way easier and I now understand alot of things in C++, which were just to complicated without basic knowledge of coding. So beginners I would recommend to start with python and then maybe take a look at C++.",True
@__Beant__,2018-05-29T04:01:26Z,0,"Sorry if you already thought about this, but what about training a neural network to detect the puck in varying lighting conditions? You could use the frame as input and the centre of the circle as output for building the training set. Then tune your threshold values manually for some different lighting situations like white daylight and yellow lamp light, low light etc. It would be interesting to see if a NN could generalise to new mixed lighting scenarios.",True
@TheNiters,2018-05-28T21:56:18Z,0,"You need a special case if the puck location is past the arm, that just moves the arm along the back edge from the middle so it can push the puck out onto the board again :)",True
@Lambda_Ovine,2018-05-28T21:08:22Z,0,"Can you mathematically define a line between where the puck gets stuck in a corner and where the arm can hit it, and then establish that if the puck stays in the said of that line where the arm can't hit it (gets stuck in the corner) for more than, let's say, 2 seconds, the arm will then lift the 'whatever-its-holding' and position where the puck is, then push down, and with a quick move forward it will throw the puck back to the 'field'.",True
@Lambda_Ovine,2018-05-28T20:07:03Z,0,"Well, evolution made possible for non-living, non-conscious and non-intelligent things to ""create"" living, conscious and intelligent things.",True
@barbarairena6714,2018-05-28T18:55:27Z,2,"missed the livestream, but I think the format is a great idea! you should  do it again in the future but announce it some time in advance ! keep up the great work! greets from Austria!",True

@sb-rj6yb,2018-05-28T06:37:52Z,0,please let me know where can i buy the whole setup,True
@Jeacom,2018-05-27T21:19:26Z,1,"What if you do something to track the arm position in screen too, with a colored marker just like the puck so, instead of converting coordinates you just check if the arm must go up or down based on it's screen position.",True
@nitrame,2018-05-27T20:48:30Z,0,Have you considered teaming-up with Mark Rober on this?,True
@tomhense6866,2018-05-27T17:06:35Z,0,Maybe the ML-Kit for firebase from google could be a good alternative to tensorflowJS on mobile devices.,True
@shrikantsawarkar3929,2018-05-27T16:06:25Z,0,Sir what is best yolo or tenserflow,True
