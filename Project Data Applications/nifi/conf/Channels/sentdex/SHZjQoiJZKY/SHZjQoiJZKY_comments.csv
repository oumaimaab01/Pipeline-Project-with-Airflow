@shane3994,2015-08-06T03:05:40Z,0,"Hi, thanks so much for this tutorial! I'm following the entire playlist, but using Python 3.4, so I have to figure out conversions along the way. I know that Quandl has a Python module already, but I wanted to use this as a chance to learn APIs  I'm having an issue where the lines are not being properly split, so I end up with the data but it comes out like this: b'Date,Value\n2015-03-31,3586000000.0\n2014-09-30,2813000000.0\n  How do I fix this? I've looked through google, and tried using things such as read().splitlines() but that just removes the \n. Thanks again for your tutorials!",True
