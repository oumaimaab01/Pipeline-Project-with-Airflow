@Achmedsander,2018-03-25T19:43:24Z,4,"Seems like telnet works a bit differently on windows 10 than on whatever sendex is using here. It seems to send every keystroke separately.

Server is returning response on every char I type, even though I didn't press Enter. I have tried with: telnet set ? set crlf open host port ,but results was the same.
