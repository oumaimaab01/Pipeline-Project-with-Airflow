@wendbnew,2023-06-26T04:59:52Z,0,"I'm really trying to understand every bit of code to force myself to learn the applications of functions, loops, etc. The thing that helped me with this one was identifying that after:   for row in game:         check.append(row[col])         #print(check) you can print(check) to see how check[ ] has been appended and thus you can see how it is that col, [1][2][3] - from range(len(game)) - works as idex identifiers for the 'row' value in the for loop - from (row[col]), thus indentifying the first index from each row value (or, row), then they are passed through the check.count code. If you run print(check) you can actually see the process the code is running to check those values and being able to see that and how each bit affected the other bits REALLY helped me. Happy programming!",True
@tomasmanrique400,2021-03-28T10:40:56Z,0,A little more advance. But with numpy we can just transpose the matrix and do check = numpy.transpose(game).tolist(),True

@denislavkaragiozov5876,2020-07-27T21:13:36Z,1,"Woah woah, okay I get why you wanted to use range so we can understand what range is. Also, an issue with your code is that you are doing `for col in range(len(game))` this will check the length of all ROWs, not columns. If you have a boomer boss he might want to make a tick-tack-toe with a board of 3x6 for example. In that case your code will iterate over 6 (the number of rows) instead of the 3 columns !!!! Simple solution, we assume that if the first row has 3 columns, then every other row has 3 columns. If your boss is so insane to make a tick-tack-toe game with rows that have different number of cols then you might as well present him with your 2 weeks notice... so back on track, all you have to do is check the len of the first row, which is len(game[0]) which will return 3 in our 3x6 case.",True

@michaelwald6671,2020-06-18T22:20:13Z,1,"I got hung up on ""if check.count(check[0])"".   It took me a stupidly long time to figure out that the list cleared and started over after three iterations, which left me wondering why we were only looking at the zero position.   After printing it out, I saw this:  [1] [1, 0] [1, 0, 1] [2] [2, 2] [2, 2, 2] [1] [1, 2] [1, 2, 2]  Which makes more sense. I'm still not exactly sure *why* it clears out (where does it say 'check' can only hold three values, and then clear?), but at least now I don't feel *completely* confused as to why that code actually works.",True
@sandeepsingh-mo1uc,2020-06-14T22:20:45Z,1,"Hi ,  Great Video. I am able to follow through most of it. One basic questions- can you explain more on what the below does only  check = [] for row in game:        check.append(row[0])  What are we doing here and then   check.count(check[0]) ---> has check got a value now instead of row[0]  confused! your help is greatly appreciated!

@MrTimdeK,2019-07-18T11:13:18Z,2,"Thank you for the time and effort that goes into making these videos. I have a question; is it normal when watching a few of these in a row you suddenly have a hard time following it? I got lost at the check.append part (around 3 minutes).   Edit: I came back to it 10 mins later, checked your next video and it suddenly clicked together. Great feeling! For some reason it didn't sink in that with check [] you were making a new list. I guess watching all 11 in a row requires as many coffees as you have mugs for me.",True

But wouldn't this be an ideal situation to use a while loop (packaging the two checks together in a nice little nested bundle)?  I'm really new to programming so I'm sure you have good reason for not opting to go that way, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me why. Also, I hope my pseudo code example makes sense.
