@JGunlimited,2019-03-16T07:15:04Z,0,"I think for the copy/pasting bits it would have been ideal to optimize that ahead (put the repeated code in a generic function). Because though it looks like a lot of code (intimidating), it really isn't. Also all the copy and pasting is prone to error, which makes following the tutorial tricky for unnecessary reasons.",True

@gabrielmaldonado8810,2015-08-20T08:39:54Z,0,"Great tutorials as always, if you accept some tip, if you write all the control flow statements first before filling in the logic, you will avoid headaches and save time later on trying to figure out where it fails, also will be clear for your viewers.",True
