@MaKaNufilms,2020-01-18T13:25:44Z,0,"I now it is an very old video but quiet a good tutorial to understand the fundamentals of OpenGL (better then NeHe???) in Python. I figured out to bugs in your code :   1: In main you had still the random tranformation: glTranslatef(rd.randrange(-5, 5), rd.randrange(-5, 5), -40.0) This leads to irritations while plotting the ground. without the ground it is not really noticeable   2: Your ground vertices 2 and 3 are flipped, that leads to ""corner"" in your ground.",True
