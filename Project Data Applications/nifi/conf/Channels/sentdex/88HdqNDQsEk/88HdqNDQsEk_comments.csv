@robthorn3910,2019-04-06T04:10:48Z,0,"I have watched a number of your videos and I find them pretty good but I have some suggestions for future videos you could make.  A criticism I have is that you spend too much time typing in code, something that is not really helpful. To your credit, I am able to download the code and run it for myself although you could make it a bit easier to grab the code and supporting files. But there is another suggestion that might be more helpful.  Your videos I have seen demonstrate some feature of the OpenCV library. While this is interesting what might be more informative is a series of videos that show what different functions are available. In the same amount of time that you currently use to demonstrate one feature you might be able to demonstrate ten or twelve different features that tend to demonstrate the spectrum of available functions in the library. As I understand it, there are over one thousand individual features so a quick demo of some of them could be a good introduction to this important body of work.  FYI: Slackware Linux (NOT ubuntu), OpenCV 4.0, Python 3.7.2 (although I prefer C++ using g++ 5.3.0)",True

I am trying to piece together this script in a way that saves a picture when a face is detected, waits for a few seconds to re-arm so to speak, and then continues about it's process. One of the ways I have been trying to avoid a million misfires is using      if np.any(faces):             time.sleep(0.5)             playsound('Activating.mp3')             cv2.imwrite('Intruder_Log\Intruder.png',img)             cv2.destroyAllWindows()             cap.release()             time.sleep(3)  That's clunky and crashes once it finds a face, but for now the part I am trying to understand is why can I use np.any(faces) but not np.any(eyes)? It gives me the error that name 'eyes' does not exist, but as far as I can tell in the script we made in the video eyes was defined in the exact same way as faces, both are xml cascades with multiple Boolean values which is why I chose to use np.any and not all..

@CyndroTheStarFire,2017-02-11T14:36:07Z,0,"Hay there :) i could do with a hand, I'm running something like this on a raspberry pi 3 so obviously its running quite slow.  my project is to make eyes that follow you around using openCV and recognize the facial emotions to react to, like a smile to indicate happy and so on. some reason though it runs only runs at 2 frames a second just to find the face and not even using more than 20% of the CPU. According to the internet its cause its only using 1 of the 4 cores and to use more i need to use multiprocessing. could you maybe do a tutorial on that (or link me one if already done cause i some reason cant find it :/) .  but the main thing i would like to know is I'm planning on running the eye part of the project in a 2nd program, so the openCV is finding the face and emotion in one and then passing the X,Y of the face to the 2nd program that will take them and position the eye to look at, and if it doesn't get any new X,Ys it will just act ""naturally"".  the reason why i want to do this is i want 1(or 2 of the) processor core(s) to focus on the eye movements and the others focusing on finding faces to speed this up. this would hopefully make the eye have more frames to make it look more fluent while the finding program runs slow. If there is a better way to do this though i would happily listen to it :) as I'm not very well known to python",True
