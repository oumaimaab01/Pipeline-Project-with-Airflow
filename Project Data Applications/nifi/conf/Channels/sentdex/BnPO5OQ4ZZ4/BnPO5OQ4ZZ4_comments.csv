@TheSamsonizzle,2016-03-11T19:59:03Z,0,"Great, thanks for the explanation. I read up on all of the documentation about *args and **kwargs but this is what I need to understand what they actually did. Note, that with **, you could even have the arguments in the dictionary out of order and using ** would unpack them in the proper order (see example below). You'll see below that when I made the dictionary, I put x and y in reverse order but it knew to unpack them in the correct order using them as keyword arguments:  def dosomething(x,y):     print x     print y       coords = {'y':2,'x':1}  dosomething(**coords) 1 2",True
