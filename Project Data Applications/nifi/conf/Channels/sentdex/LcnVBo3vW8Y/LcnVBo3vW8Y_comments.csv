@revellights1000,2018-04-19T19:30:20Z,0,"I realize this post is nearly three years after you posted your video playlist.  Thanks for all your help with your Pi robot videos.  More useful than you might think.  How do you ensure that your Pi, the SD card, and/or the Python program are not corrupted when you unplug the battery (or it goes dead)?  I've tested my Pi when powered by the 5.1V/2.5A corded power supply, by just pulling the plug when the Pi is on.  The Pi does then boot up Ok when I give it power again.  But, shutting off power to an computer generally is not a good idea.  I haven't seen any video of a Pi robot that shows how the builder resolves this.  Thanks.",True
@johnstreety642,2018-03-12T15:29:25Z,0,"Do you have any idea why this program and your others would not be compatible with the GoPiGo3? I understand that the GoPiGo3 library is completely different, but I would think things would still be ""forward compatible"". When I tried to use your program on the GoPiGo3 everything worked but the motors  I am teaching a Robotics class in a middle school, and I wanted to use your videos to help me teach them. In addition to this, is there some way I could get a list of the commands from the GoPiGo3 library? I thought you would know because you seemed to know a lot about the GoPiGo library.",True
@MACHINEBUILDER,2018-01-24T04:21:47Z,1,".... I know this was 3 years ago, but you know you could have done : rotation = random.choice([right_rot, left_rot]) rather than: rot_choices = [right_rot, left_rot] rotation = rot_choices[random.randrange(0, 2)]",True

@9dra9on9,2017-07-09T17:14:27Z,0,Okay could you please help me. This is my very first time learning about this and I'm extremely interested in constructing and programming my own robots based of transformers.. But anyway based off just viewing; my thoughts are so you need a program set up to the robot (somehow) and then you just type into the program what you want the robot to do?? But how do you know exactly how to type it? Is there a certain coding that goes into that?,True

@Qladstone,2015-10-18T03:00:35Z,1,"Thanks so must sentdex, you got me excited to try the GoPiGo.  For those wondering if we could write it such that GoPiGo keeps moving, but stops the moment it comes within some range of an obstacle, instead of stopping to check every 1 second, perhaps we can do this:  def forward_trudge():     fwd()     servo(70) # to point servo dead straight ahead     while True: # GoPiGo is still moving forward         time.sleep(0.1) # just so it checks the distance every 0.1 seconds         if us_dist(15) < 30:             stop()             break # exit loop, end of function  with this you can call forward_trudge() anywhere in your autonomy() function, and do a follow-up after forward_trudge() which will be executed upon GoPiGo meeting an obstacle. If you wanted GoPiGo to not move forward indefinitely you could of course give it a random chance to break out of the loop every time it enters it. (You could track a counter, make that probability of breaking from the loop increase as the counter increases etc.).",True

@clemdrounear1433,2015-08-30T20:48:15Z,3,"You killed me when the error came and you said ""Oh, we called sleep"" then just erased! NoneType object is not callable! Of course, sleep = time.sleep(1) execute time.sleep then return the value of the function (obviously you return no value by sleeping!). Besides its impossible to call a function by its name. So would be ""sleep = lambda: time.sleep(1)"" then ""sleep()"" (but who would do those unecessary calls ??)  Keep up the good work, really enjoy your videos, I learn much, you do know python !!",True
