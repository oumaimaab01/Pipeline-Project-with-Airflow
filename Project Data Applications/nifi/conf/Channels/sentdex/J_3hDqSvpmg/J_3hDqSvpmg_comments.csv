I can now run inference on my crappy laptop using just CPU and RAM, I don't even have a dedicated GPU on this machine. It is surprisingly quick with an average inference time of about 10-15 seconds (this is with the 13B model, the 7B is very fast at like 3-4 seconds max).  The next step would be to increase the dataset with fresh data gathered from the forum and run another QLoRA pass.

@sidehat1655,2023-09-23T17:04:43Z,1,"Just to explain what rank is to anyone interested:  *The basics:*  _A vector._ In 2d that's a certain amount on the x and a certain amount on the y. So [1, 0] - pointing towards the x with a length of 1. [1, 0, 0] is a 3d vector. [1, 0, 0, 0] is 4d. _A basis matrix._ This contains more than one vector. When you plot on an everyday graph you have the x pointing to the right and the y up. And you plot your vector against that. Well, you can use 2 vectors to describe that. [[1, 0], [0, 1]] one vector pointing to the right and one up. If you changed that to [[2, 0], [0, 2]] in your basis matrix then your vector [1, 0] would suddenly be twice as long. I hope you can imagine how useful that is in graphics engines.  *""Get on with it! Tell me what a rank is!""*  Imagine your basis matrix is [[0, 1], [0, 1]] - here is the x and y bases are both pointing in the same direction. So no matter what vector you have you can never enter the second dimension. You're stuck on a line. So, the concept of rank tells you it's 1.  Now imagine you have a huge matrix of thousands, even millions of dimensions in a neutral net. If your rank is less than your dimensionality then you're inefficiently wasting computational resources and you have an inelegant solution. If you're using 100 dimensions to describe 3d space then you've gone very wrong.   You need to boil it down to 3 dimensions but that's what's in the geometry.",True
