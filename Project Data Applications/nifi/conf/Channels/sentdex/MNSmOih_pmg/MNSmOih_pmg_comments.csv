Like a human solving a problem the ai needs to work with the data to brake down the task into chunks it can hold in memory. Split that beginnimg and end into many more beginnings and ends like a human working on a todo list involving many research-, understanding- and execution- steps.

Of course that also means you need more memory for each such expert.  But if you have like 8k Tokens for each expert, where one sees every single one of the first 8k tokens, one sees the first 4k and then 2k worth of every second token and 1k worth of every fourth and so on, and another agent that dilates in steps of three, and five, and seven - you probably get a fairly dense coverage even at fairly high numbers.

The one output that matters is either a single CLS token in the front or a probability of next token near the end. maybe you just have small transformers and then chain them with LSTMs or something.,True
@TTTrouble,2023-07-11T21:53:21Z,1,"I had the exact same question/concern about longnet. A youtuber named Gabriel Mongaras made a really good video reviewing the paper and in the comments I asked him about how Longnet gets away with just arbitrarily not calculating every n-th attention score and he gives a really good explanation. It still feels like it shouldn't work, but I guess if the attention matrix is inherently composed of a lot of redundant data, then I think the idea is during training, it's still able to calculate weights in a way to more efficiently transmit that data through the layer hops of one token to the next.  I don't think youtube links work in comments, but you can just google Longnet and his video is one of the first that come up.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kdETHUhjAA&t=1542s",True

@adempc,2023-07-11T21:28:11Z,1,"I'm not gonna pretend to understand any of this. But it sounds like we are pushing up against the limits of processing information without it being compressed first.. is that right?  I know we aren't computers, and computers aren't us - but we have various levels at which we process information, top level all the way down to the unconscious level.  Are we missing the equivalent with our current tools?",True
@JazevoAudiosurf,2023-07-11T21:23:58Z,0,"I'm thinking if pretraining is long term memory, if you could store all the information of a data set in the weights, and had a perfect memory, it would not be necessary to have long context. instead you would just ""fine tune"" the pretrained model with your 100 page document from your prompt and it would perfectly know the document. in other words, if we would overfit the model perfectly during training, and every prompt would be a perfectly overfitted fine tuning, it would solve the problem of short term memory. the trade-off would then be its reasoning abilities because of overfitting. but if you have vast amounts of data, that could potentially be solved. perhaps this solution would require more than double precision weights. I think it is possible with enough data and compute, without altering transformers, to solve AGI. it probably won't happen this way, but it shows that there are many ways to reach it",True
@MenkoDany,2023-07-11T21:14:15Z,0,"How about binary tree attn? Like don't do it every nth token, do it halfway through each segment, and fractal your way down. Either way, pardon my sleepy bactery infection sick brain, I think this is one of those fundamental laws of the universe. It's alway been cheaper to gather facts, than to find relationships between the facts. The number of possible connections scales with dimensions, which are not always orthogonal to each other and don't have many correlations. While the number of real connections is <<< smaller. AI is just compression, and while current LLMs brought us closer to the kholmogorov complexity limit, I don't think there are easy wins here. Either the compression will be even more lossy (maybe we can ""focus"" on the important parts, have less compression there? I think in a way, that's what ""expert models"" are today), or we will need wins in computation we have not seen since the invention of the transistor. Or maybe quantum/hyper computing somehow finds a sneaky way to compute what we need :D",True
@YEASTY_COMMIE,2023-07-11T21:06:17Z,1,"I had this simple idea a while ago to improve attention, just take a normal transformer, with like a relatively small context, and apply it to your whole large context like you would with a convolution filter in a CNN, and either by changing the stride or with max pooling or something, reduce the size of your input context. Do that over multiple layers, and you can in theory compress your context, divide its size by two or four at every step, until it fits in that 2048 window.

@MaJetiGizzle,2023-07-11T20:51:56Z,4,"Okay, I just finished the video and these are my thoughts.   Yeah, the O(n^2) nature of attention in transformers is really what’s holding the tech back at this point. If we could somehow get that into even a linear complexity that would open up so many doors of possibilities for LLMs, context length, etc.  I see a lot of people trading space in the form of vector db embeddings as a way to offset the problem without completely addressing it, which works to some extent for long term use cases, but ultimately doesn’t make the problem go away. At the end of the day we’re all essentially needing to chunk things at some level of the LLM pipeline.  Ultimately, I do think a breakthrough with the architecture is possible, especially if we go down the route of trying to scale these models horizontally instead of vertically with techniques like MoE from OpenAI.  I think once we get to the point where we have tiny LLMs automated together with a Kubernetes-like software for managing tiny neural networks we’ll be in better shape.",True
@Bencurlis,2023-07-11T20:49:17Z,6,"I think we should just ditch Attention as the main information processing feature entirely. Attention will always require to have all tokens available in memory, so the memory required will always scale linearly with the context size, even if we bring down the time complexity of Attention to O(n) (and that will always imply missing some pairwise token relations or simply some of the tokens). A smarter replacement would be to use Attention with a smaller window, but let the model ""place"" the window anywhere it wants in the context, as needed, and the model will only need this subset of tokens in memory. Of course this would require to get back to RNNs in order to let the model update the location of the Attention window in the context, and that would increase computation times quite a bit.",True

So,  once you have defined the subject, I store that as a concept and recall it when necessary, not the long waffle getting there. If that whole  waffle can be condensed to a single token , you have a vast space opening up.   E.G I only have to say 'Lap-time' for you to be triggered into racing car mode . Am I right? 8⁠-⁠)",True
@bigphab7205,2023-07-11T20:42:52Z,0,"Why would longnet go public if it didn't address those points? Does the sagging attention curve have anything to do with the data? More specifically, what is it empirically related to? If it's the model itself and the calculations that's one thing if it's simply a product of the data and the format that's different. One thing I have noticed is that the ""good"" data all has a common theme/format. It seems very likely to me that the curve was a learned shortcut. I'm even more convinced of this by the simple inclusion of RLHF. There is a very specific way most people choose to communicate, especially in writing, and that curve that you mentioned matches it perfectly.
