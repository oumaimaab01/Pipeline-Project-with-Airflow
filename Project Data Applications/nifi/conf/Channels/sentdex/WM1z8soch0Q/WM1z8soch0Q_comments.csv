@wdavid3116,2020-08-23T03:35:48Z,0,"If you're doing socket communications you almost definitely should not be using pickle. pickle is insecure and can be used by an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution on a server. It should never be used when the source of the data is not known, for example on a server that can be connected to by people other than you. It can be used under certain circumstances, but if you only know one way to serialise data in python it shouldn't be pickle. Pickle is very powerful and convenient but that convenience comes with a price WRT security which is laid out in the documentation.

@Kevin_KC0SHO,2019-03-14T17:14:35Z,0,"This is very helpful thank you for creating it.  May I suggest a future video/s.   First off, I‚Äôm learning Python, and I‚Äôm not really a programmer by trade, but I enjoy it.  I work as a telecommunications engineer focusing on ethernet networks mostly for private transport and fiber based internet circuits up to 10G.  I need to often times do things like:  ping a list of IPs ping a range of IPs telnet (yes I know telnet is bad, use ssh) to a list of IPs  Very basic, but time consuming when done manually.  Capturing the output from those commands and processing it would be helpful as well.   Something interesting like processing traffic that comes in to a listening port setup by a python program would be cool.   Really anything network related would be awesome   You videos using pandas have been very helpful as well. They are some of my favorites.   Thx",True
