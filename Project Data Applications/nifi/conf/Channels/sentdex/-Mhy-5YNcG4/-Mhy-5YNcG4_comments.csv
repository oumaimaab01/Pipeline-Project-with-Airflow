@nuryaqilahmj5419,2016-06-13T07:48:04Z,0,thank you so much for all the tutorials but do can you make a tutorial on how we can compare a stored image to a detected object or face? like a saved image we have it in our desktop and compare it to the video/image that we are capturing from the webcam.,True
@ClearNinjaFox,2016-03-18T07:08:44Z,0,"im looking to process video not pictures soooo do i still want to follow along? also i have my own private server at home which is a pc with a TB of memory and 4GB RAM so do i want to use that to manually drop all my train images on a folder ? im asking cuz im sorta confused a bit because i use processing ""java"" and when i use the opencv library example for face detection i dont see any server being called i just see the harrcasscade file being called to do its thing o maybe this is the robust difference between python and java ? but point being made there is no data folder with images of face for finding faces so again im not sure if this is the main difference between images and video ?",True

@mohamedgabr4911,2016-02-12T18:45:51Z,0,"Hello, thanks for your tuts, I was wondering if I should use this way for face recognition algorithms ? would that work good with big data ? i'd like to hear your suggestions ? thanks again!",True
@tuvipurevsuren4563,2016-02-09T16:16:21Z,21,thank you so much for doing tutorials...you give us power...,True
@isaiasvelasco4399,2016-01-28T21:41:43Z,0,hello bro. I've been wondering if its possible that you could find how much time it took the program to recognize the object? i know its something in the order of micro/mili sec it would be really helpful to me.,True
@ahmednouman9871,2016-01-25T11:53:49Z,0,you are the best on youtube !! I would be grateful if you could show me what is the best way to implement American Sign Language Alphabet recognition  (ASL). Thanks a lot :),True
@sandipchaudhari4973,2016-01-21T12:30:29Z,5,"this is what i need, I learned 200times more from your video than my college.  free vs $2000  -_-",True
