@nextuphighlights,2020-05-05T19:45:01Z,0,Unfortunately got a KeyError: 'sentiment' at the assets=result.index.... step... anyone can help?,True
@naushilb,2020-03-29T11:31:38Z,0,I find that when i run this code a lot of entries are being dropped from the factor data. Upon closer inspection it seems that some of entries in result.sentiment are NaN. I'm not sure how to work around this issue. Any suggestions?,True
@bigdave3034,2019-09-18T13:36:03Z,4,"Hi sentdex,   Could you please give some more info on why you have used quantiles here and not bins.   In my opinion, when creating the tear sheet, use bins not quantiles. Quantiles requires the number of entries to each quantile to be equal. i.e. with 80 data entries, sorted into 4 quantiles there needs to be 20 entries in each quantile (bin). But, the value of an entry (in this case the sentiment factor between -3 & 6) must not be duplicated between bins, i.e. if one entry of a particular bin has a value of 0, for example, none of the other bins are allowed to hold an entry with a value of 0. This means for discrete data like the sentiment data you provide (thank you very very much for this data by the way)  it is highly likely that if you want to sort into quantiles, and the number of quantiles is equal to the number of possible values each entry could hold (as is ideal as you explain),  in order to sort into equal sized quantiles (which is a rule for quantile sorting), values must span bins (which is not allowed whether you want to sort using bins or quantiles). This means using quantile sorting is extremely inefficient for discrete data.    Because discrete data is essentially already sorted into bins (one for each possible data value), you should not try to force the data into quantiles if this does not represent the data effectively. According to the alphalens documentation and my own view, if you are using a discrete data for your signal/factor, you should almost always sort it into bins and not quantiles. The opposite is also true for continuous data, as data points in continuous domains have no ideal number of bins or quantiles, sorting them to have equally sized quantiles if oftern a very good representation of the data. Determining a 'good' number of quantiles for continous data can be determined by analysing a graph of the alpha factors against quantile number (run analysis with different number of quantiles) and looking for a 'kink'. When sorted into quantiles, if you randomly sample the data there is an equal likelihood of choosing a data point from any of the quantiles. This representation, while not always effective, is generally a very good way to sort continuous data.   Thanks, friendly neighbourhood data scientist",True

@AA-xz1ut,2017-06-25T21:41:17Z,0,"Harrison, many thanks for the great tutorials! Could you please clarify the following: As far as I understood the two quantile portfolios (in this example) are build on a daily basis (independent of the chosen periods) and the periods correspond to forward returns over next 1, 5 and 10 days. Therefore I would interpret cumulative returns chart with period 1 day simply as cumulative returns of the two quantile portfolios (that are rebalanced every day). But what about periods 5 and 10, how to interpret these charts and how does one aggregate these returns on a daily basis (for example see 16:33)? For example it wouldn't make sense to associate 10d forward return to each date daily and then compound.  Would it not make rather more sense to change schedule function to 10d and then set periods to only one option: 10d (i.e run different simulation/produce different quantiles for different periods? Or did I misunderstood the functionality?",True
