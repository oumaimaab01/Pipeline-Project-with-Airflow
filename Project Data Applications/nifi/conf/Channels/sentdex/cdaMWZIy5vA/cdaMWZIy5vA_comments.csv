Is there any way out?",True
@gauharaya145,2017-10-29T17:03:07Z,1,"if you are struggling to see your csv populated it is for the reasons described by @Saurabh below. Initialise your empty array like so -> data = []. Then do -> data.append({'Date': datetimeStamp, 'Unix': unixDTStamp, 'Ticket': ticker, 'DE Ratio': value}).  Outside the for loop convert your array of hashes into dataframe like so -> df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data). The rest is as @sentdex describes.",True

These are really great videos and I learned a lot from here, thx very much.  May I have a basic question: When I forget to type ""df = "" in code:   ""df = df.append({'Date':date_stamp,'Unix':unix_time,'Ticker':ticker,'DE Ratio':value,}, ignore_index = True)""   nothing is in .csv file produced, why?",True

@JamesKao,2015-09-20T08:11:54Z,11,"Some of source files are have a newline between the closing '</td>' and '<td class=""yfnc_tabledata1"">'.  Other files are missing 'Total Debt/Equity (mrq)' altogether.  Here's how I resolved it: ``` if gather + ':</td>' in source:   value = source.split(gather + ':</td>')[1].split('<td class=""yfnc_tabledata1"">')[1].split('</td>')[0] else:   value = 'N/A' print ticker + ':' + value ```  Awesome tutorial thus far Harrison!",True

@ronniec95,2015-04-17T19:10:09Z,0,"Just a thought but maybe try SortedContainers for your data append. It'll be faster than Pandas as it wont do the dataframe copy (which it does on an append), and then finally convert to a dataframe at the end; which is a copy(sadly)",True
