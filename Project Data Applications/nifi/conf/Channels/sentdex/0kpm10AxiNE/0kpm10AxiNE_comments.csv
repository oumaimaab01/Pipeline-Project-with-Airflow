@hotdogjoe4039,2019-05-06T19:36:03Z,0,"I have been able to create a dropdown that populates the section values that were created from a '.ini' file with ConfigParser().

Is there any way to do this?       def cfg(self):         cfg = configparser.ConfigParser()   # 'URL' = section header of the '.ini' file # 'NAME' = section.

@knighthawk9833,2017-07-10T01:22:40Z,2,"Hey sentdex, I'm curious. I watched your Tkinter series before this and noted that the code for Tkinter is a bit complex and can be unwieldy at times and I downloaded your Sea of BTC app just to see how the GUI worked on my machine (I know it's several years old at this point) and I noticed the app tends to lag when you try to select options and hesitates a bit before it opens. Is that a problem inherent in Tkinter or the fact that the app actively pulls data from the web and updates every few seconds? If it's a Tkinter issue, do apps that are written with PyQt have a similar problem? And how hard would it be to write an app with the same functionality as your Tkinter app using PyQt?",True

@pavanmullapudy3571,2016-08-28T21:20:21Z,0,"Hi Sentdex:  regarding the usage of ""self"", I have a doubt.  why did u use  //self.styleChoice = QtGui.QLabel(""Windows Vista"", self)//  and why didn't you use //self.comboBox = QtGui.QComboBox(self)//  In the first line of the home method,  yo have used  //btn = QtGui.QPushButton(""Quit"", self)// . But further down you have used // self.btn = QtGui.QPushButton("" Download"", self) //. In this second case, I have experimented with self.btn and renamed it as btn2 and the code executed just fine.   Why like this ? Where do we use self.variable and where do we use just a variable ? Can you please help. Thank You.",True

@Tunixpro,2016-04-05T09:23:51Z,31,Instead of writing the style names you can simply use :         comboBox.addItems(QtGui.QStyleFactory.keys()) This will add all the available styles to the combobox. Thanks so much for these tutorials!,True

Could you please give more information on that?  2-) The connect method seems very misterious to me. If my style_choice method requires more input parameters, how do I use the connect method? what if I need to use X,Y of the point I clicked in the style_choice (not sure why I would need this with combobox, it is just one example =)  )? what if I am calling a method outside the class which requires other parameters?  btw excellent channel!",True
@helpimswiss,2016-03-06T15:49:27Z,5,"There's a small mistake in the video. When the button connection function is added the function should take as parameter the variable text. Should be 'def style_choice(self, text):'",True
