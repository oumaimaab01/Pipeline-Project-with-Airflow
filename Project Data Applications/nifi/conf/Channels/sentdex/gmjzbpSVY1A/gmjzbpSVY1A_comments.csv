EDIT: Understood guys, the graph is plotted w.r.t. the actual input variable (not w.r.t. the wx+b i.e., the value of neuron before applying ReLU).  In this case the first neuron is fed with the input 'x' which gets processed by first neuron and so on. Finally, the output of the second neuron (after applying activation function) is plotted w.r.t. the original input (i.e., 'x' which is fed to the first neuron). And now if we observe how the output of the second neuron changes w.r.t. the original input is indeed very much non-linear!! Interesting stuff!!

Thanks for doing all this, the graphics help a ton to see how everything works. The only suggestion is to explain why the different concepts even exist, with some real life examples. This looks like it would be great for someone experienced that has used activation functions and everything else you discuss, and now they would like to closely see how it works. For a noob like me, it is not clear why they even exist, and it feels a bit like we are just listing different concepts without a clear picture of why, and what we are trying to achieve with this network. For example when you were showing how well the ReLu fits the data its not clear if that is actually desirable since it seems to overfit the data.",True

This is because in every way, the ""how"" of translating the neural network weights to what you show in the graph wasn't spoken about. Because of this, information on how the second layer neuron determines the cutoff for the graph gets lost. As well as how long of a stretch in the x direction is determined by a single neuron-pair. So unfortunately, I think I'm completely lost because of this, since going forward I can't make any sense of the representations anymore :/ e.g. everything will be a black box that does stuff just because it works because it works, etc just wanted to write this as feedback, hopefully you agree and find a way to maybe improve it!

@morthim,2020-05-14T20:05:20Z,0,"why would we have a null section of the function? the activation functions are ___/ but when you get beyond some arbitrary domain the function stops being used. so why have the flat part of the line? why have part of the activation function be not activated? why not just have ""from domain point x1 to domain point x2; y1 =initial height,y2 = domain finishing height""   another related thing which confuses me is that your criticism of the best fit line for your sin wave is why overfitting can occur. why isn't there a gradient of fits? the 2 point fit is that ""bad"" one. if you add 2 more points, you can have the x min, x max, and y min, and y max; that would create an approximation which is sometimes called a triangle curve or triangle wave form. yes you can approximate the waveform better through a RELU, but you can get a very similar derivative function with far fewer fitting points, by focusing on topological traits like minimums and maximums. yes you would need to do something different a bit if you were trying to approximate area under the curve. but tessellation itself could be done by factoring out functions. let's say you want to fit lines to the function, and you have data which falls outside of the lines, but by eyeball you know it could still be under the real function. you find the place where teh r^2 value is most off, then offset the best fit function. this gives a metadomain. factor out the original function and you get a -x^2 function. create another triangle approximation, see if it is inside, and do the offset again if not. repeat until determined to satisfaction. over fitting is still possible, but by spreading fit across layers it becomes harder to accidentally do. also if you don't need intermediate spaces, you reduce the additional cost of fit from some sort of a math thing, to n FLOPs- with n being the number of dimensions of the dataset.",True

It needs to be well trained and then fed proper data, sure.  I know it's harsh, but when for example, the NN decides someone isn't eligible for a loan, it does so by analyzing many inputs and by being trained on previous examples. It there is a human at the end to ""verify"" and possibly veto the descision, there is no need for the NN in the first place. At this moment, after the implementation of NN to the deciding process, I think we should just trust her. And sure, it will some times make unpopular descisions, but they will be unbiased.
