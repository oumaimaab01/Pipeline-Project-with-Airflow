@pietroaretino6390,2016-07-17T00:06:14Z,0,"Hey Sentdex, super appreciative of these videos. I just threw myself into Python and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I have a question which I wonder if you could answer. I've been messing around with creating simple plugins for a video-game. I am no programmer, but this really interests me, and keeps me going with learning how to code. This video-game has all of its modules/library/functions/variables etc. stored in an an assembled C-Sharp.dll. I have been able to sift through it by using a decompiler. However, I'd really like for my IDE to use auto-complete functionality but I am not sure how OR if it is even possible for a Python IDE to interpret an C-Sharp.dll. For example when I type ""import math"" it gives me a list of possible libraries to import etc. Afterwards when I call a function from the library, like ""math.pi"" it gives me a list of possible functions/definitions to utilize from the ""math."" module. This really helps me learn and see what is available and how to properly form the code and get the syntax correct. Would this be possible with a DLL from another programming language, or no? Sorry for the long question and thanks again for your videos!",True
