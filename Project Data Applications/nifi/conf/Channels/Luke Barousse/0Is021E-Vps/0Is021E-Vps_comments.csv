@nigelwilliams7920,2024-01-05T11:57:59Z,4,"I asked ChatGPT to calculate the discharge of a pipe under given friction, diameter and headloss.  It messed up the units and the answer was wrong.  I told it to check the units and it did, repeated the mistake, then checked itself, and fixed the mistake.  Next time I asked it got it right, and noted that it had checked the units.  So it is taking training from us to improve.  I thought that was impressive.   I will, tho, always ask and AI to calculate AND give me a reassurance that the answer is correct by some external reference, even just by working the calculation backwards to give the initial values. I wouldn't trust it to get a drug dose or any other live-critical calculation correct tho!",True
