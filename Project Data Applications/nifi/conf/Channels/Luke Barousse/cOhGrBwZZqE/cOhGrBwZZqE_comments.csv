@thebobbrom7176,2023-11-05T00:59:35Z,0,I've been saying Excel should have Python for years  That said honestly I think they kind of ruined it by having it run on the cloud.   Firstly something that's not spoken of enough is the obvious privacy aspects   If you're dealing with sensitive data dealing with it on Microsoft's servers is going to be a worry point   Secondly as you noted there you have to worry about the connection to the server.   That's going to become something that's going to get worse as it becomes more popular  Especially as Microsoft will likely start charging for the compute time.    Really there's no reason they couldn't of had it do it's processing locally beyond Microsoft's need for control,True

@PoutineLord,2023-11-02T11:31:17Z,3,An issue I've had with using Power Query which has pushed me to basically using purely Python was the maintainability of the queries and the file itself. As I scaled up what I was doing in a single file it became unmanageable whilst with just python scripts I have Git and Jupyter Labs to hold my hand with documenting and version control.   Having Python script living inside excel cell's sounds about as manageable so I foresee it becoming problematic if you have too much Python in a cell or too many cells with it built in.   I'm curious where you would draw the line and what mitigation methods you could take! Because sharing an excel file in terms of portability and required technical skill is just miles ahead of trying to get the layman to set themselves up in Python so I'd love for this Python in excel formulas to be a winner!,True

If I only need Python to call C, C++ or Rust functions, there is a lot wrong. What Microsoft thought about this remains mysterious - the explanations are anything but rational - it will probably be about economic interests. Probably they have seen that obviously many people like to program in Python and want to bind them as new customers, what do I know.

@alexaneals8194,2023-09-06T19:25:12Z,4,"Good video.  Although I don't actually use Excel or Python for much, it's still interesting to see what can be done.  I only use Excel to create some quick and dirty data sets for testing.  It's convenient to generate insert statements when you need to populate a table with test data.",True
@Limestarz,2023-09-06T18:41:41Z,7,"I think Luke hits it on the head with the experience excel users, and that you can pretty much do everything in excel if you know all the formulas, so I don't think python in its beta state will do much except for maybe a few edge cases that might be cool.    And  to expand on that a little excel has pretty much all those functions that you can do in python already, including the graphs. You can do heatmaps, histograms, and even do linear regression, etc in excel and you don't need boiler plate code to do it or even have to use chatgpt as mentioned for noncoders/lazy coders.  I personally find seaborn graphs to be terrible looking (almost all of them, a few look good). The dashboard shown in the video looks clean though, so that looks intriguing, but I would be remise  to say that you can do a version of that probably with a pivot table (maybe?) and an advance/expert excel users I work with usually make pretty clean looking excel files that do a bunch of fancy things. That dashboard did look really clean though, but I don't know how much of that you can replicate just through excel because I know filters work basically the same way but just look a little uglier.     So, I'm not convinced right out of the gate that anyone would be able to flex their python skills to all those excel users at work because the graphs are already done and most of the ""analysis"" is also already been done in excel so anything brought to the table via python is usually  not something that anyone would notice (simply because excel can do most of what python can do anyway). I don't know how much machine learning you could reasonable do in excel that, 1, your job would need if they are using excel to begin with, but 2 size limits as mention would limit machine learning to a small degree, but mostly machine learning is at least advance machine learning is a little too complicated to use chatgpt.    The main reason I use python with small office data is primary to automate reports and connect it to other things like outlook for automated emails etc.    Honestly, I think its just better to do python in an installed environment/ide like vscode or jupyter notebook so you can use other modules.",True

@ttuurrttlle,2023-09-06T15:08:13Z,9,"Not having an option to run the python code locally makes this feature borderline unusable IMO.  Having the cloud computing sandbox environment is a neat idea to make spreadsheets that use the python features more portable so you don't need to worry about configuration on various systems that might be used to view the spreadsheet. But I haven't heard anything about the cost of running this on their servers. It seems free for now while it's new and you're paying for a microsoft office account, but the only way it's going to stay that way is if they are harvasting some data from you that they can sell or they'll charge other cloud computing costs. The latter could be a problem if you opened a document that ran some python that was running some expensive stuff then it could be a pain.",True
