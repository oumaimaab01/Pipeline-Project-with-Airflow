AI-assisted tool should be able to serve most of data analysis requirements. Gen AI won't replace data analyst job, but it will surely change the job desc and reduce the number of analysts needed.

@keenshibe7529,2024-05-21T21:40:25Z,2,"LLMs are extremely good at doing simple, isolated tasks that are clearly defined. Definitions are in the form of clear parameters set out by user prompts.   That being said, it's only for short repetitive tasks, and also at the risk of not providing enough context, prone to errors due to that or other factors such as unreliable external data, hallucinations, misunderstanding. Thus, they should always be a tool and require human reviewers for the outputs. For example, image recognition has been developed for X-ray scans for diagnosis, but human doctors still have to review them as they are prediction models and not absolute. The same thing goes for data analysis, outputs requires SMEs to review them.   Does this affect the junior workforce of DA? My guess is that it will likely it will, depending on the company. Analysis work is not finite. Having more efficiency does not mean there will be a lack of work. For example, SaaS products such as Tableau and PowerBI are simple to use for non-technical users, but it simply changes the way data professionals work. LLMs will be likely to be part of the workflow of many professions, including DA, but not replace them. Smaller companies that have a tight budget might use LLMs instead of hiring DAs as the expense really affects them, and they just have to deal with the downsides. But larger companies are aware and want good reliable intelligence as they want to have a competitive edge over other companies.  The tech field has always been constantly changing at a very fast rate, with many technologies such as blockchain, cloud, distributed computing, SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, etc. And AI is going to be the next one to rapidly shift the industry. Professionals will have to adapt and embrace new technologies or be left behind. That's how it has always been.  Tl;dr: introduction of LLMs will decrease demand for smaller companies without budget, but bigger companies are aware of the downsides and need human SMEs to review the data. Demand and supply rise and fall due to the hype. Gradually, people will understand the limitations of AI and what it does well and not.   For anyone reading all that, thank you. I appreciate any counterarguments and criticism! :)",True
@philipp5636,2024-05-21T17:08:57Z,19,"To put it plain and simple: Query and plot is not what a good Analyst is doing.

@melkorbane,2024-05-21T14:41:51Z,0,"This is more a referendum on universities and job titles than anything else.  When you get a job as a jr. data analyst out of a university you have no skillset. Real data analysis looks basically nothing like your homework or tests. It shouldn't be surprising that GPT 4 is better than a Jr. Data Analyst because they literally function exactly like the model with severely less data processing capabilities (they search the same internet the model was trained on for answers to questions they have no idea how to answer on their own).  Senior data analysts aren't much better. They typically have 2-3 years of experience doing Jr Data Analyst work described above and have only just started learning enough to be more useful than Google. Most companies have you working on crap that isn't honing your skill so the in the 2-3 years you've probably only logged a few hundred real hours on the skill craft necessary. I'm honestly surprised GPT-4 didn't do much better than seniors too.  The solution to AI is Universities are going to have to get their sh** together or we'll have to go back to an apprenticeship model of learning. AI isn't the source of the problem that low-no skill labor doesn't add much value and is an investment. It's a new phenomenon that people with no skills should expect to make $150k/yr. People with no skills are and always have been an investment. Instead of spending 50+ hours/wk in college doing BS, a sane society would have workers spend 50+ hours/wk working for free (or as little as an AI) developing a skill that makes them useful.  I don't think GPT 5 or 6 or 10 is going to beat Principal level Data Analysts with 15+ years of experience. Because the real truth is that Expertise is about the intuition you develop to solve problems that don't have obvious/recorded solutions already. And while future GPT's will be able to develop similar levels of ""intuition"" (they're already showing signs of it) the hallucination problem absolutely is not going away.",True

@nessim.liamani,2024-04-27T22:34:33Z,9,"ChatGPT summary :  The video transcript discusses a research paper evaluating whether GPT-4, a large language model, can effectively serve as a data analyst. The study compares the model's performance against human data analysts in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness. GPT-4 was found to be faster and significantly cheaper than human analysts, particularly senior ones. The study focuses on three major job scopes of a data analyst: data collection, data visualization, and analysis. GPT-4's performance was evaluated based on its ability to execute Python code to extract data, create visualizations, and generate insights. The model's accuracy and validity were assessed against human analysts, with varying results across different tasks. While GPT-4 outperformed intern and junior data analysts, its performance was comparable to senior analysts in some cases. However, the study acknowledges limitations in the specificity of the questions posed to GPT-4 and the small number of human analysts evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which GPT-4 can replace human data analysts. Overall, the study aims to explore how AI models like GPT-4 can aid human data analysts in improving efficiency.",True

It completely avoids the T of the proverbial ELT, assuming the data in the database is complete, cleaned, and that all of the information about the value distributions or the foreign keys can be inferred from the data or from google search. Any Data Analyst with a bit of experience knows that domain knowledge collected directly from the stakeholders and inferences based on said domain knowledge is paramount in extracting the proper views on the information collected. 2. The visualizations produced are barebone and would not be satisfactory for more complex, multivariate information (and I highly doubt ChatGPT can correctly generate complex visualizations that give proper storytelling, are explicit, and clear. 3.

How messy was the dataset, how was it cleaned, was there some complicated imputation necessary, what metrics were used and what assumptions/approximations were necessary to do the statistics? If any of those questions arise in your analysis, your answer cannot be „correct“ but only an approximation to that. But they seem to have treated correctness as a boolean, which either implies that those data were trivial to analyze or that they actually have no clue about basic science.  The fact that they compared the costs of humans to a machine makes it quite clear to me that they had a strong bias (maybe even OpenAI sponsored/backed?) as the comparison of cost/hour is quite meaningless in that context. If that metric was meaningful without further considerations no business would even consider switching to the Cloud.  I guess, if the paper was published without that AI hype, it would have been rejected from each and every reputable journal. I mean the paper reads as if it was written by some bachelor students who are tasked to gain some scientific experience by writing some report about an internship and it was published in a journal with a significant impact factor of > 9.  I am really more astonished by this than by their „findings“.",True

@yemunnsoe8450,2024-04-03T11:59:53Z,4,"Hey Luke, cool video! I gotta say, when I see these GPT-4 analyses, it feels like they're just spitting out what the chart says.   You know, the real magic comes from understanding the bigger picture and weaving a story around the data. That's where the human touch makes all the difference (maybe GenAI can do better in near future).",True
@saminyead1233,2024-04-03T11:11:32Z,36,"Man, from what the study shows, I think Data Analysts have a lot to be happy about here. This essentially means, that aspects of data analysis that could not be automated before, can be automated now. The study shows that GPT-4, if given some very specific instructions in natural language, can provide some very valuable outcomes. But this does not replace the need for human data analysts, because it's the humans who can take the fuzzy questions (e.g. hey Luke, why the heck is our sales low this year?) and figure out the best way to approach the problem. So, in this example, Luke can find out what metrics he should be looking at to find the answer to the question.  As a result, in the end, you still need your human senior data analyst like Luke, he is the one who can bring order to chaos. Once he's done that, he can apply some unprecedented levels of automation thanks to GPT-4. So, it is in the hands of your experienced analysts that LLM's like GPT-4 are such powerful tools.",True

@afterhours4890,2024-04-03T00:42:16Z,82,My two cents is the bottleneck for replacing DAs with AI is the stakeholder communication and the speed of which companies will adopt this technology. Would the stakeholders who are communicating with AI feel confident enough in themselves that they queried the AI correctly to retrieve valid results. I love AI. It helps me out at my job everyday but I don’t see it replacing DAs soon. Keep studying data analytics everyone and use AI to learn more about it! It’s a great field to join!

I believe it will require ongoing development efforts for maintenance. Additionally, organizations often lack a well-established data model and semantic structure that can seamlessly integrate with ChatGPT. While the analysis is insightful, it may not fully account for the complexity and availability of data in a real-world corporate environment. Similar functionalities are already offered by tools like Microsoft Fabric Copilot, which streamline data preparation and model definition processes, making them more accessible and efficient.",True
