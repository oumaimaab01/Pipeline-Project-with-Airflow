@michelleflood8871,2023-05-25T06:10:03Z,1,"Good luck not having a degree. Not everyone has enough drive to self-study complex things. Universities will push you to understand very complex tasks to have good grades or to impress your peers. Only a handful of people have the drive to self-study (why do you think expensive BootCamps exist). Finally, higher education is where you will find friends/network. Uni is also for lazy-ish people (like me) because Uni life is wayyyy easier than 9-5 life, so it is the time to relax and don't feel like you're unemployed or not contributing to society right after you just graduate high school.",True

@WWG1-WGA,2023-01-18T16:01:46Z,0,"I do get what they say about degrees .  I’m an engineer, and once a no one after that 😢, now we have online everything, many careers , many options, but at the time of HOW your brain works . Degrees like mine , make you see everything super “easy” to accomplish because your bases are really strong and that’s because university push you to learn a lot , “things that will never use in the future” (1/2 true) , BUT that will give you a wide perspective of situations. Without it, you still creating yourself in a way and that’s good.

@jordanwoodard3645,2022-12-15T18:52:58Z,2,"I mean, I think it has value, but not in the way some people presume. If you have a degree, you use it to your advantage for prospective work. If you don’t have a degree, you use other components like prior experience, solid references, and projects that showcase your ability.   I think one of the biggest things employers take from someone who has a degree is that they were willing to commit to something for years, and had some sense of direction that can be easily viewed. If you don’t have the degree, you have to still show those qualities, just through different means.",True

@mateosking,2022-10-27T09:45:04Z,25,"If you have a degree in liberal arts, i say yes, it's overrated. If you have a degree in math, physics, or some kind engineering is a different story. You will learn a lot of useless things in the university, in STEM, they will force you to learn various kind of thinking process (without you notice it), which is very usefull.  You can learn this on the fly, and lot programmer/data analyst/data sciencetist will become digital woodchopper, they don't need a degree, but if you want to do it in a high level, it's a huge plus in the first 5-10 year.",True
