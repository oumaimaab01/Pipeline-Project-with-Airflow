@youtube_research,2022-10-21T04:13:04Z,1,"Hi Luke. A great video as always. I found this clip as I was finding  Anaconda to be too heavy for my labtop. Yet, I found many other Python tutors recommending Anacaconda. I do think neither is perfect or completely bad. Rather, my question is, in 2022,   (1) Speaking from your personal experience, did choosing VS Code over Anaconda by any chance bother you from carrying out your data analyst job at work?   (2) Relatedly, if I do not plan on being a developer (as of yet at least) but would just like to use python for data analytical tasks only, does NOT having Anaconda severely hinders me from picking up Python knowledge?",True
