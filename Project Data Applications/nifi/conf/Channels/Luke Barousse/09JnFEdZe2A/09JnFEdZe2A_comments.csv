Humans are better at perceiving length than area, and better at area than volume.   I don‚Äôt remember the name of the book, but it kinda of explains this my saying that visualizations are people using the physical space as a metaphor for numbers. The more complicated you make the metaphor, the more it become confusing rather than explanatory. The rawest form of data is just a table, and visualizations should only be as complicated as absolutely necessary.  Personally, if I have 3 dimensions of data I‚Äôm trying to visualize, I prefer to have an x-axis, a y-axis, and some color scale (gray if the color is arbitrary, or whatever color I think would make the data more easily understandable)",True

@seanmcgrady8688,2022-02-08T12:36:43Z,44,"This video reminds me of a concept I learned on Dataquest called ""data-ink ratio."" Data-ink ratio is the idea of using the least amount of ink to communicate the most amount of data. So data : ink.  Decades ago, when we used newspapers, it was a real art to craft a graph which used little ink and conveyed lots of data.   An example of this would be placing the column titles at 9:10 in your video into the bars themselves, then coloring them to match the background. Also, making that very same text bigger. This would reduce the ink in a newspaper, but it has the effect of communicating each bar as an identity too. Your eyes won't need to dart left to right so much, making it easier to read.   You could also experiment with making the text's size match the bar's size. So SQL would be spaced a little, but also huge, that way it uses more of the bar. Excel would do the same, but not quite as big. Doing this, you reduce the ink used for a newspaper. For our electronic, modern approach to consuming data, it just becomes another method of communicating the relative size of importance each skill has.   Very, very timely video. I'm 99% finished with my data analyst course on Dataquest. Just one more %! Then I need to learn Excel and either Tableau or Power BI. I was leaning towards Tableau, but this video made me rethink Power BI. Choices! Thank you for another excellent video.",True
