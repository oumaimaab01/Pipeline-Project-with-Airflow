@patrioticamerican8355,2022-01-03T06:23:38Z,1,I've been programming since I was 13 and honestly computation is totally language independent even though there's always  different Paradigm shifts that are always evolving since the days of Fortran.          The truth of the matter is just because there's different libraries and packages that are already written and all you have to do is just pretend to be a hacker and jump into those libraries and packages and develop some code that is not even likely understood because it hasn't really been thought out yet or planned it's just sort of Cobble together.             The truth is the same results can be obtained using Microsoft quick basic so the language platform that the computation is actually performed in & Computation on is actually irrelevant just like anyone could write a thesis using notepad and nobody really needs to use Microsoft Word or Google Docs...             Python will come and go and something else will replace Python and all of its little funny libraries                videos in the future will be doing comparisons on whatever the next flavor of programming language are 10 years from now,True
