@LuvLuke954,2023-01-20T19:35:39Z,15,I took the first course from MacQuarie U based on your recommendation!! I finished Excel Skills for Business: Essentials and now I‚Äôm starting Intermediate 1  course. It‚Äôs thorough and detailed and I‚Äôd recommend it highly -especially for beginners. I pushed through most of it bc it IS so detailed and I already knew 60-70%. BUT I pushed through bc it also continued teaching me functions and tools I didn‚Äôt actually know existed and that made much better sense.  Take this course! ‚úåüèºüíô,True
