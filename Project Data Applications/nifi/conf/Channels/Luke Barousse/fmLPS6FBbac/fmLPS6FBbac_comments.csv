@richteffekt,2022-09-04T07:51:03Z,1,"Currently taking the course (6 of 8 modules done), with very little previous knowledge and with ambition to switch careers to data analytics/data science in the long run. The program is broken up into small chunks to be easy for you to slice into daily segments which helped me certainly. It is a very brief introduction into the necessary concepts and tools therefore offering no real depth. In the SQL-segment I felt the more complex issue was actually missing a practice segment because, let's face it, if you don't write your own queries, things will seem opaque and arbitrary. (They point you to another free online SQL course during the program so I will do that once I go into project work). The most informed thing I feel I can say about the program is: you get everything shown once, along with some basic application. It's then up to you to really find your project work for your portfolio to show your future employer. I was working full time in my day job taking a 1 hour+ per day on the program after work on four days of the week with a six week break for an important other business project. At current pace I expect to finish the 8th and last certificate in just under 8 months (break included; so it could be 6-7 months with no interrupts). I expect to be building my portfolio (and application) for another 5 months total after (doing one business dev project of my own choosing, one real life business pro bono, one data heavy data base thing with sports results and betting odds over a decade-long period and trying to put it into video form for YouTube so it's easy to follow the process I went through if an employer wants to dig deeper).  So knowing what I know today, I'd suggest to completely switch fields to data analytics I plan about one year to do it. If you have spare time you may be done quicker.",True

Save your time and try to get into web dev or SWE instead. For everyone 1 DS position open there's like 10 SWE positions open.   Also, if you're handling data at your current job like accounting, general operations, etc. That's extremely basic. Even advanced Excel is nothing, you can learn that in a month.

I work in marketing and I am thinking about upskilling myself in data analysis to help with my job in marketing. In particular, most of my job focuses on digital ads. Hence, I think it would be useful to upskill myself in data analysis.  Having said that, digital marketing has other areas to specialise in such as PPC, SEO, email, etc. I don't think data analysis is the key driver in my work.  Just wondering from your perspective, would you think that I should take this course or would you advise me to learn specific tools directly like SQL, Tableau, etc. to help with decision making and reporting in marketing?",True

I`ve seen mixed reviews for example of the Simplilearn courses offered together with Purdue University. In some countries, a PG course specialization is considered at the same level as a Master's degree, but in other countries that option doesn't even exist and it's even difficult to translate the term and try to explain to the employer what a PG course is. How are those viewed in the market in several countries in general? (I live in Japan, and it's one of those countries that I'd need to explain what it is like)  [",True

After talking to advisers and professors, my degree choice still makes sense especially the computational side requiring Numerical Analysis class and other programing classes along with the Math minor.   My only work experience is working at a corn seed company as part time general labor. Would this course make sense for me for having access to entry level Data Analytics work?

@brendabaholo1610,2021-05-07T17:45:33Z,0,"Beloved, Please give this your special attention.   God is a Good, Holy and Just( meaning that He up holds justice and does what He deems as good) Judge. He is also forgiving and He is All-Loving. He is also perfect meaning that there is nothing about Him this is  contradictory. But How can He forgive you and me but still uphold Justice.   Look at it in this way:  Judges who punish the innocent and release the wicked  and quilty, are wicked, evil and are corrupt. It does not matter how much a quilty man is sorry for his crime, he must go to jail. Let's say a man raped and murdered a little girl, but is so sorry for the rape; the judge must still send him to jail. And likewise God must still punish our sins, but He can still forgive us. How? How can God forgive us and still satisfy His Justice?   This is how:    All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no not one‚Äù (Romans 3:10, 23 NKJV). -It means that each and every single person sins and has sinned.   ‚ÄúThe wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord‚Äù (Romans 6:23). -Death is eternal separation from God in hell. - But believing in Christ alone allows you to be with God in everlasting joy.    ‚Ä¢""The iniquity and sins of each and every persons were placed upon Jesus Christ who was sinless.   ‚Ä¢Jesus Christ, the Son of God was crucified for our sins.    ‚Ä¢Jesus Christ was buried and our sins were buried with Him to live no more.  ‚Ä¢Jesus Christ arose from the dead on the third day and all who believe and receive Him as Lord arose to new life with Him.  ‚Ä¢ New life in Jesus Christ is received through faith in His death burial and resurrection, when the person repents of their sin and asks Jesus Christ to forgive their sin and wash their heart.  Beloved seek Him, read the Bible, not the catholic Bible(deutero-canonical books)  Start by read the whole of the new testament, starting from Matthew to Revelation..   i love you because Christ loves me.",True

@marcd1981,2021-05-01T01:58:10Z,4,"Hi Luke, thank you for the video. I just started researching Data Analyst training and certification and was planning on studying Excel, SQL and Tableau when I saw this Google course covers them.  As I am brand new to Data Analytics and have only gone through Trade Schools and Military training (no college degree), I have a different view from some of your comments on this course.  I think 6 months and under $250 for a certificate that will get your foot in the door is not a huge investment (time or money), especially when you compare that to the cost and time of a college degree.   When you commented on the portion of the course you watched being dry and then having to speed it up, I believe this is because of your experience level, with you already being an analyst. This course is for someone like myself that is brand new to Data Analytics, and I would appreciate a slow, deliberate pace of the material over speeding through it so I can finish faster and save $100.  My last comment is about you stating this course isn't the only thing you will need for a career as a Data Analyst. My impression is that Google is saying you do not need any experience to take this particular course, not that you will not need further experience after completing it.  None of this is meant in a mean spirited way, if that's how any of it comes across. I am just stating my opinion as a ""newbie"" to the field, and what I think is a very good offering from one of the tech giants to get more people trained in what they need to be trained in to get to work right away.

I have 3 coworkers that took a certificate on the technology (crm tool) we  work with. They are math, history and law majors. They excel at working with the tool and delivering simple stories but whenever they encountered something related with service integration, code complexity, asynchronous problems or even simple SQL etc they require a lot of help.

Some takeaways I have on this course is that the videos are a little dry, but select videos have a question or two that pop up through the video or at the end that pertains to the video content. I will say that it does seem like a very high-level overview of everything. I have learned a ton so far and will continue to finish the program.

With that being said, I'm quite disappointed in this course.   First, SQL. They list a source of materials, which are free anyway, and therefore zero input from google.  I also find it kind of unacceptable to start off SQL with a query, and not going first through the concepts of relations, keys or constraints. If I m given a list of free external sources(which are not enough, and aren't google materials, so they spent zero $ and zero time on them), what's the point of paying google? They spent so much time talking about how important data is, that I expected a similar approach with the rest of the topics.  Second, tableau; same approach, zero guidance, zero input from google, just some free stuff I could have found myself.  Hoping their assignments are worth the time and money.   Not even sure the course is worth it, unless one is a pure beginner. With a little bit of exposure into this field, I m afraid it would actually hurt me, as I would be pictured as a pure beginner when I m not. Am I missing something?",True

To be honest, If I was a hiring manager I would take the person who completed the Google IT cert over a person who took the A+. Hands-on is better than power memorising any day of the week.
