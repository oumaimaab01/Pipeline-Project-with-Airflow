Then they put a box next to the pictures and asked Gemini what they reminded it of (or something along those lines) and it said Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat. I was amazed by that level of abstract thinking, something I haven‚Äôt even seen with ChatGPT but now I wonder if they didn‚Äôt fake it.",True

I tried the same prompts with Bard with Gemini and had to give a lot more instructions to produce what I wanted. In the end, Bard gave a final solution that was subpar to the one from ChatGPT V4. Bard wasn't able to intuit my prompts like V4. Yeah, Googles video was deceiving",True

It‚Äôs really only a couple steps away from something like the final video. The PROBLEM is they didn‚Äôt consider their audience carefully. Marketing was targeted a daily folk, but they showed it to engineers. üëè",True
@DaveTheChronicler,2023-12-08T20:30:36Z,0,"I respect your perspective on this but I think this is more the case of people not doing a good enough job at following up with the material that orgs put out.   The initial disclaimer is vague, I agree, but at 0:22 in their hands-on demo, they include another disclaimer about shortened prompts. I also do not think that reading the description of a video, and the very relevant blog-post attached is too high of a bar for people to cross.  Is the video showing an inspiring use-case that isn't actually being used? Yeah, of course. But, if you have critique about this more creative presentation, and consider the paper that partners with this video to be an obfuscation of their methods, I think we'd need to agree to disagree. Just a little disappointed with the lack of diligence on reading what is essentially the Part 2 to the video they put out (the blog post). I don't think Google's scamming us, I think people just aren't like reading what they are putting out there, and that's on the end-viewer imo.",True
