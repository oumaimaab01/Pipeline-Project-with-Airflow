@adfbi,2021-10-08T18:15:51Z,0,"Hello Luke, thanks for this tutorial...The ability that you have in explaining these concepts is pure talent! I have one question regarding the ""Application"" part: when I created my code and then I compared it to your solution, I noticed that I didn't put the first ""else:"" (the one under the ""Re-enter the name"" line), while you have put that ""else"" instead. Despite this my code worked perfectly. So my question is: is it necessary to put that ""else"", or is it rather a matter of ""making the code as beautiful, clear and tidy as possible""? Thanks in advance! Regards",True
