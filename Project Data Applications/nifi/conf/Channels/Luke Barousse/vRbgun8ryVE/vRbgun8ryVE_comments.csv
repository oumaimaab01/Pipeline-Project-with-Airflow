I got my BA in English and Spanish (double major), was going to be a teacher, then got my Master's in Spanish, still on the teacher path, but am now doing the Google certificate and hoping to pivot into data analytics. As I'm working on this career change, I constantly wonder, is my English/Spanish BA, plus that MA put me on the same level as having no degree in the eyes of recruiters?

@youtube_research,2022-10-15T13:41:21Z,2,"This should be less about being college degree versus no college degree, but rather about whether you have something to prove your capability or not. As interviewees made it clear, they did go through difficulties without college degrees. Let's not look away from it and accept it as it is. But it is not impossible to land a data job without a degree IF, you can showcase something that can make up for not having a degree. 1:43 This guy was in the military for 6 years, this 2:00 guy actually some work experience, and 2:06 took the chance to study computer science in a that is not in his native language, English, AND took time to complete Goolge Data Analytics Certificate.   The bottom line is, if you already have a college degree, great. You are less likely to be filtered out from the get go. So, spare the rest of your time to really work on a project and archive it well to be able to show it to your prospective employer. If you don't have a college degree, be aware that you may be rejected from the beginning. But don't let that reality become an excuse for you to not try.
