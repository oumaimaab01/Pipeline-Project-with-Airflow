@kartikaggarwal677,2021-07-21T10:37:32Z,0,"Hey Luke, I hope you are doing well. I had a question on which you can make a video I guess.  So the question is, ""What is the scope of Analytics? Are we just facing a boom in Analytics and thus it would fade away in say next 10 years or not?"" Also would data science jobs would have much relevance or not in the future?  Thanks for creating this amazing content Keep up the good work!!",True

All topics included in the career have been mentioned and to be fair it has been bit overwhelming. Currently i want to learn python as one of  steps towards becoming data analyst. Would you recommend learning videos/books covering python in general or more targeted info specifically for data science?",True

It can get discouraging when you see others so far ahead in their data science journey but this served as a great reminder to not let the negative thoughts get in my head. Rather, focus on my firm plan of attack. Thanks, Luke!",True

@Rawi888,2021-07-14T12:37:10Z,1,"Hey Luke.  I ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been up and down with my life. I did computer science, dropped out after a year to pursue a degree in business. Dropped out of that after 2 and a half years because I no longer had the funds required to continue. And now I‚Äôm back again doing computer science but I flunked the year. I just felt so overwhelmed, with childhood trauma creeping up, a failed relationship and overwhelming thoughts of just being a wasteful drag to society, it was hard to stay focused.  I‚Äôm in this limbo of making too many excuses and not forgiving myself.  If I stayed in computer science when I started, I would not only have finished my degree but could have been pursuing a MSc in data science by now (my new dream). I‚Äôm 23. I literally failed being a first year again.  All this stuff is ‚Ä¶ overwhelming, but god do I love it all. I just feel way to stupid and way to late.  Do you think its worth it for me to pursue this career (from the sounds of it) ?  By the time I finish graduating (if they aren‚Äôt any more set backs) I‚Äôll be 29-30, is that not too late or am I already putting roadblocks in my mind that don‚Äôt exist.  The fact that I can‚Äôt pass first year computer science (for the second time) doesn‚Äôt give me hope that I‚Äôd be remotely cut out for these hard hitting projects.  I don‚Äôt consider myself a loser but‚Ä¶ I feel like losing. I‚Äôm just kind of exhausted to continue living in a perpetual cycle of nothingness. Or should I fight through it all ? Once more, just‚Ä¶ PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH.  I don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ (of course I‚Äôm not expecting you to tell me what to do with my life, but some advice would be warranted. For the time being, I‚Äôm looking for a job so I don‚Äôt feel like a total useless piece of garbage. So that I can start once more next year, and do it part time)",True
@VitthalGusinge,2021-07-14T08:41:11Z,1,you are putting thumbnail of broken code and asking to staying motivated that's really good reason to checkout how,True
@julianr1760,2021-07-14T05:53:18Z,2,Nice video as always.  When you are feeling unmotivated just watch one of Luke's videos and get the work done!  ;-),True

@AdriaanVanNiekerk,2021-07-13T20:01:25Z,3,Smashed that like button ‚úÖ thanks for the great video. I use the same technique and it really works. Only having one BIG goal will  easily overwhelm you. That is why I also like Jupyter notebooks as each cell is a mini goal and each successful run is a mini celebration üï∫üèª Looking forward to the next video!,True

@antoniodiaz5290,2021-07-13T19:48:48Z,13,"Great video! It's not easy to stay motivated after a bunch of setbacks, having a checklist and seeing yourself progress is great rather than getting caught up on the big picture that might seem overwhelming",True
