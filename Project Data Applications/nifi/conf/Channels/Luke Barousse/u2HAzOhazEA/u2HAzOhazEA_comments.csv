@nirmalkumard7102,2023-03-29T06:19:16Z,20,"To be honest, in my case, I'm a 2018 civil engineering graduate trying to switch my career from site engineer to data analyst. It's much more difficult than I thought. I did the Coursera Google analytics certification program and did some projects. They didn't consider me as a fresher as well as an experienced person. That's why many opt to fake experience certificates in India. Some of them were fired. It's difficult for me to even get a call back from a recruiter as well.",True
