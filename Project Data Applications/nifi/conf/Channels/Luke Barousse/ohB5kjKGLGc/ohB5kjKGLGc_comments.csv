@FUZionist,2024-04-16T02:53:11Z,1,R is very powerful with all those packages.,True
@Alaneblut,2024-03-11T15:32:06Z,13,R is specifically designed for data statistics.,True
@BruceNJeffAreMyFlies,2024-01-30T04:27:24Z,4,"For coding, Harvard starts with native C which is virtually NEVER used in a job. Same thing; you're only learning it for better understanding.",True
@ransinghray3688,2023-11-23T13:38:56Z,1,How did you transition from R to Python,True
@munchymanjaro9070,2023-11-18T15:22:48Z,0,Julia...,True
@williammbollombassy1778,2023-09-23T00:03:05Z,1,"I started data science course with R but I failed a job interview because I said I was more at ease with R than python .  Then R I said good bye to R and welcome to python. But I think R is more effective for data analysis and statistics . But Python has specialised library for that plus the advantage of being a good language for AI , ML and DL",True
@manideepak1492,2023-08-10T15:16:52Z,1,Where I learn R,True
@navi93243,2023-06-13T02:09:03Z,2,"Python is the best for machine learning and data pipelines, for the rest of things R win",True
@vferraz88,2023-05-04T11:11:55Z,31,"As R is a 'specialized' programming language mainly used in statitics, it has less use cases then python. So comparing number of job posts isnt such an objective measure of which one is better at anythiing. If u cluster the job position by seniority / area there may be more insights to this. I myself think Python is better for general porpuses and probably as a 1st language to learn. But R definitly has its own merits.",True
@zBMatt,2023-04-18T13:12:06Z,11,"Python is better for digging in deep on data using methods like machine learning.   Just as Google said, R is better for base data science and statistical analysis. It makes things like data dashboard visualizations super easy.",True
@h.t.7310,2023-04-17T20:38:01Z,0,Wtf with this post?,True
@wilrivera2987,2023-03-03T21:24:20Z,4,I use R more than Python. Honestly I like it better,True
@MickeyH159,2023-01-17T16:07:35Z,16,"I use R for my anuran (frog) research and it‚Äôs an industry standard in ecology. As I‚Äôm moving more towards analytics involving people I‚Äôll be using python. It looks like a pretty similar work flow (as long as I‚Äôm using it specifically for data analytics). I know R is a sky‚Äôs the limit language. The way I explain it R is mega blocks (easy, quick to build, but limited builds), and Python is Lego (Complex builds, slower to get started, creative control).",True
@fannyyyyyyyy,2023-01-12T09:12:43Z,2,"I too learn R first, then I think Python easier. Maybe because I already know R",True
@ryezheld,2023-01-06T04:28:45Z,0,"I learned Python first tbh, but meh, I can do both",True
@UnorthodoxChange,2023-01-04T23:47:53Z,0,I like the breakdown and may use some of the points mentioned in a future video if you don‚Äôt mind üòÖ,True
@harshacoorg3837,2022-12-29T16:53:35Z,0,"Without knowing any programming language, Now should I learn python first or R programming first  Please üôè reply",True
@Zupee,2022-12-23T09:56:38Z,1,Interesting point! If you started with Python then you should have a smooth transition over to R and back.,True
@jrt3ll,2022-12-22T21:34:01Z,1,What is R ?,True
@kevinfultz07,2022-12-22T19:19:10Z,2,What‚Äôs up ‚Äúdadda‚Äù nerds!,True

@RedJoker9000,2022-12-22T16:25:54Z,29,"In my college years, first programming course was Python. In it they said ""neither are easy but python is more growing and in search."" Which why they taught in my college Python over R first",True
@moamenyasser7832,2022-12-22T16:24:25Z,0,I already have programming basics since I learned some C would you recommend I learn python directly without having to learn R first?,True
@VenSensei,2022-12-22T16:23:34Z,12,Been looking at julia and it's wonderful.,True
