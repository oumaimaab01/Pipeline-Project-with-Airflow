@jonathanau8002,2021-06-01T00:50:25Z,1,"Hi Luke, your amazing tutorials have made my day because they are so informative and to the point, well done!! Would you also consider to make a bonus part of how to properly clean, pivot, map data using Tableau prep or using any other tools you would recommend (but since this is a Tableau module, so would an advance tutorial in Tableau prep be a good idea)? as people always have to clean their data before analyzing and beginners like me may want to see how the best tools can do the job (More tricky examples is much appreciated haha). So excited to watch all of your other videos and especially your educative contents have all become one of my daily routine to learn as much as I can before I formally start my continuing studies about data analytics in college in September.",True
