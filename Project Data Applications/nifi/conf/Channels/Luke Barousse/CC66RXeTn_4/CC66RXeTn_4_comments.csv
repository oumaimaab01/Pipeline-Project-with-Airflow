@Aodan,2024-05-02T16:21:18Z,0,"I was deployed to the border and thrusted into learning BI and basic data analyst methods/skills. I was surprised as someone who hates math, how friendly the field is, without needing major math skills, but more learning how to use the skills/tools. As you stated, if you can analyze the data and understand what you can improve/do with the data, no matter the math skills/tool skills, you are worthless as an data analyst.  I really like how data analyst applies to every field/domain. I used it in a LEO support domain, which severely lacks direct applicable products.",True

I'll use Tableau when I have to, but I find I like MapInfo better for the times I want to use Tableau, as it can edit the data source. Mostly Geo based items.  For quick spreadsheet work, i'll just use the csv editor in vscode.  It doesn't take the liberties of changing all your strings to int's that MS is plagued with.  Outside of that, its C++ or Python.   It took me quite a while to get over my biases and use Python, but once I did I fell in love.  Now everything of importance is a trained neural network.",True

But most business community people just want to keep their thumb on operations than model potential solutions. I just say, they wanted a Wal-mart world, they got it.  Lucky that cars and cell phones aren't completly from this world.  But solutions for the plant floor that many of my business managers have come up with (like the 4 day 10 hour work week) have been hilarious failures only because the math was missing. In that case, optimizing the work schedules was missing.  Everything's not trend charts, bar graphs and pulling up historical data.   The math goes really deep but comes out very practical and easy-to-use  if you can just think in terms of abstract models.  You don't have to worry about abstract math theory to do that.  Nor do you have to worry about doing the actual computing (thanks to computers).  The biggest problem is explaining the tools and results to the managers.",True

Excel simply doesn't do most of the things that you need to do as Data Analyst as opposed to the things that an Analyst does. This of course depends of the company/position since many companies call Analysts their Data Analysts, and even their Data Scientists Data Analysts, but it still applies in the vast majority of cases.  The whole point of having a separate ""Data Analyst"" position as opposed to a regular ""Analyst"" position is that a Data Analyst would be able to procure and analyze their own data. For that you will need SQL and Python. An Excel-only Analyst won't be able to pull their data from a database and won't be able to do any complicated analysis with just Excel. They will forever have to be babysat by whoever has access and can work the database, and they will only be able to do rudimentary analyses when they finally get their data.",True

@DeanOlin1,2022-02-19T00:00:26Z,0,"For anyone reading this, as far as what programming language to learn, I would highly recommend Python over R. Python can do pretty much all of the data related tasks that you would do with R, but it is also a much more popular language, and it can also be used in many other areas, should you ever find yourself needing it e.g. small scripts on Linux, automating tasks on your PC/MAC, web application servers, etc...... R is much more specialized, and while it does what it does very well, Python is a swiss army knife, and can pay huge dividends with what you can do with it. Note: the only reason I mention popularity is because it is in much higher demand than R.",True

But I only get so far. there are things that I do not how to do it or if it is even possible to create/learn it and then use it. But yes, this is so true.",True
@stevet6676,2022-01-08T16:56:01Z,31,"Great video Luke. I taught high school chemistry and physics for a few years. I think your approach for learning would be great to incorporate in classes.

@jonnybingham1,2022-01-08T16:19:35Z,0,I don‚Äôt have to be a nerd to work with data. I find it a bit of a weird pronouncement. Nerd is a derogatory label but you band it about like a badge of honour. Nerd means someone who deserves social stigmatisation and rejection because of their fascination in a narrow field of interest.  Definition: ‚Äúa foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious‚Äù. I am none of those. frankly your intro switches people off from the get go,True

Not because it is, but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own. There are many out there who put themselves on a superior position, maybe caused by their formal-education ego, but for some reason you must follow their same steps, which means you'll never be as awesome as they are.
