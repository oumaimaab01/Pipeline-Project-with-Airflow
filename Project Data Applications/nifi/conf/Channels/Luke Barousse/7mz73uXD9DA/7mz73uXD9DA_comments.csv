I need an explanation on why even though the group by clause does not contain the column ""skills"", the query works normally without any errors in postgre sql. I know that whatever is in the select statement besides aggregate functions, must be in the group by statement too. ChatGPT  gave me some insights on this like ""In PostgreSQL and some other database systems, there's a feature called ""functional dependency"" or ""functional determinant"" that can allow a query to execute successfully even if the GROUP BY clause does not explicitly include all non-aggregated columns from the SELECT clause"".  I do get the understanding that even if this works here because ""each unique skill_id corresponds to only one skills value"" , this is something to be avoided when querying databases as it is likely to give us back an error. Please provide some feedback!   Thanks so much Man",True

Not sure if you're observing these comments or not but I'm a little frustrated and lost :( I accidentally clicked 'initialise repository' instead of publish to github. There's no way to undo this action. I did look up how to delete the github folder and start again but... when i try to run this code in the console: rm -rf .git nothing works.

Followed the instructions for the issues and has issues in postgres where it says missing primary key and a few others. Wondering what to do with that or just maybe getting around the permission issues so it runs without the permission issues in vscode? is there any folder or spot where permissions aren't required or something? I asked a friend about copying all that into postgres as far as the 4 lines you had in the video and he said before doing that you have to drop the tables? i'm confused at this point honestly. Any help? thanks.,True

Still, I am stuck at about 2:09:00, where I should use the '3_modify_tables.sql' file in order to populate the tables with data from the CSV files. I did all of the steps before and haven't encountered any issue, I did load the CSV files as a folder to VSCode resources and carefully used the correct file path on my computer, but if I execute the queries I get:  could not open file ""xxxxxxxxxxxxx.csv"" for reading: Permission denied  If I understand correctly, this means that I am having issues with authorization within my PostgreSQL server (which I have set up just as you have explained, carefully following every step), as it might not have necessary permissions to read the CSV file.  How can I fix this?  Thanks a lot!",True

Fortunately you keep saying ""we will come back to this later"", if beginners can set aside panic, this should be a very rapid, but thorough introduction to SQL. Future versions may want to mention a path from SQLite to DuckDB. Although SQLite is standard now, DuckDB has targeted analytic workloads (CSV) as opposed to transactional workloads (forms). DuckDB SQL is also closer to Postgres SQL (built with Postgres interpreter). DuckDB has amazingly fast loading of CSV files and SQL SELECT queries!",True
