@0x007A,2021-07-02T00:47:47Z,4,"Begin projects as early as possible as you learn Python. Basic simple projects as a way to stay motivated. If you goal is data analytics or data science or machine learning,  begin with automating the retrieval of static data and later the retieval of data that updates over time, preferably daily or weekly but monthly will suffice - lottery draw data or weather data for your community are good candidates. Next, find a small ready-made dataset which contains missing values and other anomalies to practise cleaning the data as well as very introductory exploratory data analysis - stick to descriptive statistics at this point, no need to plot the data yet if you look into correlation, skew and kerosis along with standard desriptive statistics instead, focus on learning various distributions and how data distribution can affect statistical measures and possibly how to overome these problems. When practising automated data retrieval do not limit yourself to the equivalent of downloading a file...explore retrieving data via an application programming interface (API) of which there are a variety, learn how to only retrieve new data when a dataset has changed; a dataset might be a webpage that you want to scrape (check whether scraping is allowed), therefore, you should learn how to avoid retrieving previously obtained data. The three stages (data retrieval, data cleaning, and initial exploratory data analysis) should keep you busy for a few weeks, allowing you to hone newly-acquired skills while you continue learning Python in preparation  for other stages of the process. Become one with the data.",True
