@m12652,2024-03-04T17:16:53Z,0,"Health Warning: Who cares... there is no support anyway in reality... Seems somehow microsoft got the authenticator app to clear loads of peoples settings. You cant log in, you cant get support online without logging in first with the authenticator app. You cant authenticate without first logging in and getting a qr code, but you need the authenticator to do that. If you call you first speak to an advocate, and then they pass you to the data protection team who put on hold. After an hour or two they disconnect the call. Then.... this is pure evil genius, if you try and call back the system doesn't give you any options, it recognises your number, it just gives you a url... and hangs up!... you have to wait for a while before you can call and get the standard switchboard. And guess what.... the url wont let you do anything without logging in first via the authenticator app.  4 hours today on hold on 3 calls, all ended in support disconnecting me.  This is a situation MS are fully aware of and not dealing with.  According to the customer advocate, this is now the norm. He said ""there is no way of knowing when or if they will answer. Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn't"". They deliberately play terrible music, phasing white noise in and out and playing with the volume so much you have to keep adjusting the volume on your phone (ive never heard my phone so loud before today) then a few seconds later you can barely hear it.   The support guys told me they'd keep track and call me back if i got disconnected, yet they didn't (though the advocate did once).  The worst 5 minutes was being told to try a url, that Im already very familiar with, that also requires the authenticator app. The support guy swore blind he was passing me to someone who was ready to speak to me... put me on hold for 40 minutes and hung up.  One hour after getting off the phone and trying to relax, checked my blood pressure and its 202/116... Microsoft.... please stop trying to kill me, please stop hanging up, please just let me renew my subscriptions so i can get back to work  Ps if youre wondering why Im crazy posting this all over the place... because the only helpful guy i spoke to today at MS suggested it would help.",True

@DeruwynArchmage,2024-01-24T18:25:32Z,1,"It‚Äôs not at all surprising that the data size is limited. It‚Äôs using GPT-4 under the hood, it‚Äôs almost certainly converting it to a CSV and just passing it to a fine tuned GPT-4 model. If I remember correctly, the newest GPT-4 can handle 32k tokens, with a token generally being 3/4ths of a word.  Now, I haven‚Äôt checked the embeddings or anything, but I suspect that it treats most numbers as 1 token per number, or perhaps 2 number pairs. Something like that. Anything with a decimal point is going to get its own token for that (or maybe paired with a single number). So I‚Äôd guess a number like 23,462.56 would eat up something like 5 tokens in the best case and 9 in the worst. If it‚Äôs 5 tokens. I didn‚Äôt check exactly what your lines were, but one of them was decently long JSON. So, let‚Äôs say you have 4 cells with numbers in it, 1 cell with a label (let‚Äôs call that 2 tokens), and 1 cell with JSON (let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs about 50 tokens). That‚Äôd be 72 tokens per line. Let‚Äôs round down to 64 (for easy math and to be generous).  That‚Äôd give you 512 lines at most that it could keep in context. Hey, didn‚Äôt you say you could only do about 500 lines? Well, there you go. That‚Äôs why.  Additionally, LLMs tend to have issues ‚Äúremembering‚Äù things from the earlier parts (except the very beginning) of a message when generating the next token. They seem to remember the very beginning, and then the latest X portion of the conversation, and if the conversation exceeds X, even if it‚Äôs within the context length, you‚Äôre going to get worse answers if they needed to reference information in the portion between begin + C and end - X (where C is a very small number and X is a number that‚Äôs a very significant fraction of the total context length, like maybe 10 and 5000 or so.)  We don‚Äôt have unlimited context length and not all data is created equal in terms of token efficiency. Excel data is probably among the least efficient, whereas word is likely extremely efficient, thus, you can get a lot more out of it in word than excel. (Plus, excel documents tend to be very large more often than word files, and way more often than PowerPoint).  If we can get longer context lengths in the future, this will be less of an issue. Also, to some degree, this is using a hammer to put a screw into wood. LLMs are not calculators. They make terrible calculators. This is going to be a weakness. It must be using code in the background to do the calculations, because the LLM by itself would fail nearly every time.",True

But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the Spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word [Galatians 5:16-26]. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons (love because of material needs) and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.  *HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?* You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, ""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God [Matthew 5:8]. No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed"". Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), ""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride..."" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). Take note, God is Spirit and those who worship Him should do so in spirit and truth (genuinely by living the Word). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation.   *THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)* Heaven is God's throne and the dwelling place for God's angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man's spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man's body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man's spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man's spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man's spirit. When God's Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears God‚Äôs words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.‚Äù My prayer is, ""May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart."" Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Watch and pray!... Thank you for your time and may God bless you as you share this message with others.",True
