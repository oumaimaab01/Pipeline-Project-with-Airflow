@clueelf,2024-02-26T21:36:16Z,0,"Don't use Gemini.  It will delete your content indiscriminately.  I have been working in a chat Session for a few days working on the outline for a book.  Suddenly, it just blew away days worth of work.  Like DAYS of WORK!  I have never experienced this with ChatGPT!  Note, I say this with all due respect: Google Gemini, by far, gave me the best answers and suggestions while building a polemic about AI and technology.  Then, suddenly, it asks me, ""What would you like to talk about?"".  If BLEW ALL MY SHIT AWAY!  Sorry.  I am not being hyperbolic.  I am so disappointed.  I have never been as excited and disappointed in a technology platform and in a tech firm's leadership.  I would not invest in them.  They do not have competent leadership.  Not sure if it was a context window quota limit, or something else, but to just seemingly ""randomly"" delete YOUR customer's (I pay $20 a month for their ""Advanced"" services) content is soooo f**ked up.   Dumping this service today.",True

@bij_ay,2024-02-15T03:52:24Z,0,Except some field I don‚Äôt think gemini can replace chatgpt (not even 3.5) 4 is far away cuz The answer given by bard is so unrealistic although the prompt is same given to chatgpt. Chatgpt can access history but gemini can‚Äôt. Only for latest data i use gemini otherwise for me chatgpt is best,True

@dennissinitsky9779,2024-02-14T01:42:26Z,0,Gemini gave me some useful feedback that ChatGPT did not give. I am using free versions for both of them.,True
@budekins542,2024-02-13T18:26:17Z,1,All claims of Chatgpt4 being beaten are bullshit. I sent a diagram of an electrical circuit to both Chatgpt4 and Gemini Advanced. .and asked to calculate the capacitance of the circuit. Chatgpt4 got it right and Gemini Advanced didntü§£. ( Gemini Advanced however explain some rather hard Spanish grammar points quite well and also understood certain logical fallacies. It IS worth subscribing to Gemini Advanced but Chatgpt4 is the Godzilla of A.I).,True

@GlennGaasland,2024-02-12T08:28:01Z,0,"May I clear up a deep misunderstanding in the AI community? If this misunderstanding is resolved everybody will save an enormous amount of time. And AI will also evolve much faster. This fundamental misunderstanding is reflected in the title of this video and in many other videos in AI channels:   ‚ÄúIs this the end of ChatGPT?‚Äù  No. In fact, it is the OPPOSITE: Gemini will become the ChatGPT ENHANCER. It will make GPT better and more useful, and show you how to get more out of it. And ChatGPT will make Gemini better. The total intelligence will grow.  Because this is generative AI.   What this means in practice: now we can engage these AIs in a creative dialogue. You can have one AI interview another, engage them in deep discovery conversations, and build entirely new conceptual structures.  And when generative AI reaches a certain level, a level which is now already reached and surpassed (by ChatGPT, by Gemini ultra, and even by open source models like Mixtral), these creative dialogues begin building on themselves and give rise to entirely new ideas, insights and knowledge. Which‚Ä¶creates the foundation for totally new data sets‚Ä¶and thus also new language models as well as prompting strategies, as well as AI agents, in the near future‚Ä¶  Do you know what this means?   You don‚Äôt need to take my word for it. You can already test it for yourself. Like I have been doing this weekend. Start a generative conversation between Gemini ultra and ChatGPT4 today. Let them explore any big, vast and complex topic where their inherent capabilities for connecting different knowledge areas is leveraged, and the generation of new ideas from combining other ideas in higher order synthesis begins taking shape.  Try it. Make them go super deep and keep questioning, exploring and creating. Let them think super big and build creatively on one another‚Äôs insights. See what happens.",True

@VazerOG,2024-02-11T06:17:20Z,0,"The Gemini reolacement for the OG assistant (OGA) is so NOT READY for wide adoption. For example: I am on the Pixel 8 Pro, downloaded the Gemini app, and opted to replace OGA with Gemini.  This was a mistake. I'm travelling right now, and have never been to this place before (Traverse City, MI). Trying to navigate around using Gemini has not been easy. The responses I've gotten from Gemini have been way to complicated. For example: I told Gemini to navigate to the nearest Best Buy... but it pulled up a list of five different best buys ""near"" me. There is only one best buy in the area, and the next nearest Best Buy is maybe an hour away, probably closer to two hours away... like WTF man!? There needs to be balancing between simple requests, like ""navigate to the nearest gas station"" or ""get me to the closest Best Buy"" versus ""show me a list of gas stations nearby, or ""where is the nearest Best Buy?""  Now, the next thing: You cannot use a lot of the most basic OGA commands like turning lights on and off via Google Home. This is very frustrating.  TL;DR Google Gemini is simply not ready to be widely adopted, especially when it comes to the most basic Google Assistant command integrations. Feels like a downgrade and an upgrade at the same time.",True

@TeacherAlyssaTravels,2024-02-10T05:47:46Z,0,I‚Äôm concerned about Gemini being available in Google docs because with students that already have English as their second language they are going to be able to do it right inside their Google documents. I know that there‚Äôs already AI technology out there that does this but with my students they will take advantage of this since we use Google classroom so I‚Äôm wondering can the admin block that feature?,True

@spaceflightquack,2024-02-09T22:38:37Z,0,"Youre comparing apple with birns, just as google did. ChatGPT uses third party extensions, which are provided by APIs.

@KenJee_ds,2024-02-09T21:40:02Z,1,"I think it is interesting to see how google's traditional model of move fast and iterate isn't really working in a field with an established product. I think this works if you're an innovator and produce something new, but it seems not to work when there is a major player out there already. It is a jump, but lets compare this to the Quest vs the Apple vision pro. Apple has produced a product in the same category, but they took the opposite approach of google. They went hard on quality and differentiated features and it seems to be working. Maybe a broader lesson on product adoption out there..",True
