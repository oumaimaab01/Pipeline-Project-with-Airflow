I found better Python tutorials for the topics I was interested in. So I did my midterm and final projects in Python, even tho not taught in class.  Tensorflow in Python is pretty damn cool btw.  I see how both have their strengths.",True

@zakariyaali9909,2022-12-20T19:18:33Z,0,"Thanks luke barousse, i was learning data analysis from google. When i reaches Course 5 which is sql i see it is becoming a little bit complicated.  I intended to shift to learning programming languages and put a aside data analysis learning. Know i have been learning programming languges e.g Htlm , css, Javascript, reaact and now learning python from uni of  Michigan. Soon i wanna shift to commencing my data analysis soon when i finished python.  To be frontend web developer, django is only remaining for me. How do you see the way i approach it to deal my problems?",True
@waqarahmad9094,2022-12-20T19:05:26Z,0,The irony is that every entry level job of data analysts requires you to be carrying at least 1 year experience and a lot of other skills too. I mean how can we find a job as entry level,True

While I think you have to have a fundamental understanding of excel and analysis for an entry position, I do think one of the most important aspect to data analysis is the final part - communicating your insights. You can be the best at cleaning, analyzing, and creating visuals, but if you can‚Äôt communicate your insights, you aren‚Äôt an effective data analyst. So, even though it may be counterintuitive, it might be beneficial to start with the visualization tools or learning how to effectively communicate first and then move onto the others. What are your thoughts?",True
