@IDonShipCh,2022-10-20T06:39:51Z,0,"Hi Luke, thanks for these awesome series. One thing I don't understand though, where is the best place to keep the created virtual environment files/ folder (containing packages and libraries) in relation to your project folder or it doesn't really matter? From your example the virtual environment stuffs were created and kept outside projectexample folder, no? Or perhaps I don't need to worry about this at all? A bit confusing when you start playing with venv, virtualenv, conda and they all create their virtual environment folder all over the  places :)",True

I am used to work with R and markdown which has similar code cells and the output below them, however, in R+markdown I can run just the line where my cursor is on even if it is in a code cell using CMD + Enter, instead of the whole code cell. Is there some way I can do that in Jupyter notebooks? I searched a bit and someone suggested I should install a debugger since that is what it is called but I still have no luck in doing this.
