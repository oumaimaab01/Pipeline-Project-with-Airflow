@juanpaolo21yt,2022-04-08T07:35:35Z,0,"HI Luke , Good afternoon from Manila, I love the idea that you are explaining what needs to be done like first we do this, then we do this etc. Then you will start working on it one by one. You can be a great teacher, which you already are. Thank you, I appreciate the genuine technique and clear intention of helping newbies like me.",True

@flyingthestrals4526,2021-05-14T19:15:56Z,0,"This is a well made tutorial. I liked the presentation very much. I found that when trying to create a list with numbers from 1-100 using the range function, the correct expression would be range(1,101) since the last number i.e. 101 is not included.¬† range(100) would give you a list from 0 to 99 only, i.e. ¬†0,1,2,3,4,5.....95,96,97,98,99",True
