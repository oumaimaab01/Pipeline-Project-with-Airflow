Why it should be so difficult for me: to select the data, and then go into the popup, which disappears and bugs every other time.   Why does the ""+"" button increase vertically, and does not scale horizontally? What is this anyway?)) Nobody has been doing this for 7 years  Yet again. Tableau has a powerful aggregation computation engine. Let's imagine I have multidimensional data. Suppose I want to play with the order of dimensions, and immediately change the aggregation function for each column on a fly, in view mode? These are almost the most basic things with multidimensional data. The Tableau forums community has topics where people need it, but as a solution, it is proposed to create an N number of shits and a combo box with the desired column orders. Are you serious? So for these basic operations, I must create a dashboard, ton of sheets, a huge number of calculated fields,  which will be multiplied by two if I want to change the aggregation function for each field, write a ton of text, that must be updated if the count of dimension will change. Instead of just use Drag-n-drop to change the column order and switch aggregation function in the headers?   Okay, lets imagine I use parameters to select the order of the dimensions. Let's say I have some columns of dimensions and one for date. And I want to, on the fly, in view mode, look at the date on a first position, and then change the order and make the date last. To see the final series as a time series. This could be done with a single movement of the mouse by dragging the date column to the end of the table. But in fact, the scoreboard cannot do anything about it at all. Because you cannot write a CASE statement for calculated fields, because the columns have different data types .... So we have to stay with the dashboard and showing hiding a big number of sheets. Very fan.  I don't even want to think about the case when I want to drag-and-drop to create a new group inside the table by simply dragging and dropping one column onto another in view mode.   Usability at zero. Tableau is good for showing a static report, with few customizations, in a completely non-user-friendly manner. I believe he does not need such a strong data processing engine that he has. He still can't use it 100%",True

Most of everything that I'm learning uses software that is almost entirely free or open source. I can't seem to find a way to go around the payment barrier entirely, which is totally fine since I feel either of these softwares will prove to be worth the money.   My main concern is regarding their subscription model. As you mentioned Power BI has the Pro and Premium with pro account only allowing sharing with other pro users and unrestricted sort of sharing capability for Premium. But how does the creator subscription work exactly for tableau? Is it like the adobe creative cloud subscription wherein you can do multiple commercial projects for different clients with that account , implying that the creator¬†can create different dashboards for different clients using a single creator subscription and making it available for the client using multiple instances of Tableau online or server via maybe explorer accounts? ¬†  Or is it like the creator account can actively make and host only one dashboard for one particular client and another project would mean another tableau creator license?",True

There are regular assessments of the analytics platform market from independent industry analysts you can also check out, for example Dresner, BARC and Gartner. All three of those rank Pyramid in top place in terms of its capability, outperforming Power BI and Tableau.

@John-el5sv,2021-05-19T16:58:11Z,111,"I've not used Tableau, but for Power BI, I think it is especially better for those who have experience with Power Query, database relationship management and Pivot Charts, since basically Power BI runs on these 3 concepts mainly.   For me, Power BI basically a more advanced Pivot Chart which can link multiple tables together through relationships, something you can't do in Excel, since Excel's Pivot Charts require a single Pivot Table to work with. Also, the cross-filter options and drilldown, drillthrough, bookmark etc. features are great improvements over Pivot Charts.  Edit on 18/6/21: I've learnt Tableau, and here are my thoughts on Tableau vs Power BI: 1) Tableau is better in some areas, such as the customisation of charts, like using of the colors and tooltips cards to show more details, which is definitely an edge over Power BI. It also comes with more features such as the page pane and stories function, which Power BI does not have. In fact, Tableau uses a more tiered way of worksheet -> dashboard -> story, while Power BI only has dashboard. However, all of the charts in Tableau are interconnected so it might be a good idea to make all of them the same size, or else a change in a dashboard can mess up your chart in the worksheet, for example.  2) Tableau's style of organising its data pane is more aesthetically pleasing and intuitive than Power BI, since it organises table columns into dimensions and measures, and color codes them, you can even switch a measure into dimension and vice-versa for different purposes. Generally I find that this makes Tableau easier to use, especially for people who have not used Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts previously.  3) Power BI is better in more areas than I imagined, however. For a first, I can't really figure out how to explore and clean data effectively in Tableau, whereas Power BI is integrated with Power Query, an excellent tool for handling small to mid-sized databases. It also makes exploring and cleaning data easy. And for the data modelling, Power BI follows SQL's style of listing by table names and columns, while Tableau only lists the table names. So yea, I feel that Power BI is much better in fine-tuning the data before data visualisation, while for Tableau it's a good idea to do the fine-tuning somewhere else first, not that you can't, but it's harder to and less useful imo. But Tableau has data blending, though that has its own caveats as well.  4) I find Power BI easier to use while I'm creating my first visualization, and here's why. Power BI has cross-filtration and chart syncing automatically activated, while Tableau's default is that they are not activated, and you need to activate them chart by chart, which is tedious. In fact, an issue I had with Excel dashboards is the non-automatic syncing of slicers (filters). Also, I can't find a way to clear all applied filters using one button in Tableau, while in Power BI I used a workaround involving Bookmarks (not in Tableau). So sometimes I'm not sure if I have accidentally activated multiple filters when I only want one activated. And also, the parameters don't seem to have a ""return to default"" function.  5) Speaking of filters in Tableau, it is a nightmare to distinguish between the different types, which are filters, sets, highlighters and parameters, since they have different functions and options. And not differentiated that well in the filter pane. But of course, they add to the customizability in Tableau as well, whereas in Power BI I recall a filter is a filter with different functions that you can play with. For example, Tableau's set + parameter can give you Top N, something Power BI's Top N function can achieve. Of course, the customizability is different.   6) One huge difference between the 2 is that Power BI offers nearly the full package for free (other than publishing it online and using its store, from what I know), while Tableau Public (its free version) requires all datasets and visualizations to only be available online. So here's the main difference: for free versions, Power BI only offers offline use, while Tableau only offers online use. The problem though, is that if you are handling confidential or sensitive info, you would definitely not want to use Tableau Public since everything, especially the datasets, would be exposed to... the public.  In conclusion, Tableau is better for very customizable visualizations, while Power BI is a more complete package that needs more expertise to make good visualizations. If you are using free versions only for sensitive information, Power BI is your only feasible solution.",True

Both are entirely unsuitable for large datasets, once the row count goes over 2 billion(around 2gb workbook size), even with extracts it can take up to a few minutes to load a view.

Tableau is more expensive, less intuitive and 3rd party. also having data 'ready' before using in the application is just good BI practise. and I think you'll find PBI will also respond better to clearer already structured datasets... - having been a user of both products for the past 6 years - I much prefer PowerBI.
