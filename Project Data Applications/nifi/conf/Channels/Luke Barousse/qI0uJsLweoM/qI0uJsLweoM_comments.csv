@Heczky,2024-01-29T20:10:59Z,0,"After activating venv2, don't we need to change Python interpreter too?  I mean, for running venv2, interpreter for 3.6.12 (venv1) was enough, it seems, just asking if it could be a problem in som cases..  Anyway thanks for great explanation, I'm actually deciding between pip and conda, which could be better, but I will probably go for conda as I plan to advance from Data Engineering to Data Analytics in a fee months.. Good luck Luke!",True

@vishalkhombare,2022-12-08T16:42:05Z,0,"Can we not write ( say in the comments)  in the beginning of the code itself the list of packages with their  versions we used when created and ran the code successfully. This way if we transfer this our friend or say a teacher to 50 students, then can use this list in anytime in future to create the specific virtual env to run that code. Am I talking correct here? Or is there any other way to manage this?",True

@003kazimehrabrashid4,2022-09-30T02:43:47Z,0,"So the thing is as long as i am not updating any module in pip or conda, it should be working fine in global environment without creating any virtual environment. am i right?",True
@003kazimehrabrashid4,2022-09-29T19:36:58Z,0,"The way you talk and your visualization is simply awesome. The only confusion that i got is do i need to create virtual environment for every code that i am gonna write? What if I didn't create any virtual environment and got into this issue  , will it be fixable then ?",True
@ANAND02120,2022-09-10T21:31:33Z,0,Can we conclude that Virtual enviroment is like writing latex file(tex) with all the package used called or listed in the top of the file. So for virtual enviorment we install all the particular package version require for that file?,True

@khanhtruong3254,2022-06-07T10:17:13Z,0,"Hey Luke. You did great job on putting yourself on python starters' shoes. The series is just awesome. Thank you so much.  Just one question: at 15:50 you said we need to restart the VS Code so that we're able to select the new installed virtual environment. But you didn't restart from the creation of ""ven2"", just needed to ""conda activate venv2"" in the command line (the Python interpreter still remains ""venv1"" at the left down conner).  So it's important to select environment in the command line. Why do we even bother about the Python interpreter of VS Code at the left down conner?",True

I just had two quick Qs: 1) in your terminal and the .py files stuff pops up so you can autocomplete what you are typing; how do I set that up? 2) My terminal is the power shell whereas yours has the environment in parentheses and the dollar sign at the end; how do I get that setup?
