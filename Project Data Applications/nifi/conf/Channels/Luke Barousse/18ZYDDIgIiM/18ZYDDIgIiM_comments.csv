@macgnf9061,2024-01-10T16:43:38Z,0,love the videos luke. you have saved me many times. big question here. I have a standing desk on carpet and a dual articulating monitor mount. issue I have is with the monitors wobbling slightly even with typing. wondering how much a difference it made putting those wood planks under the legs. debating between that and just getting a cheap tabletop to replace the 1/2 inch one I have currently onto the standing desk frame. unsure which would be more beneficial. thanks!,True

@SzaaBao,2022-10-29T09:21:48Z,1,"Hello, I'm a student on 4th year of finance (from 5 overall in my country). In future I would like to be data analyst. For now I do my best to maximise my excel and sql skills. In near future I plan to add PowerBI to it. But, to the point:  For now I'm using a bit slow acer swift 3 with drained battery. I would like to buy macbook as M1 is very effective. However I have met with opinion that Excel on Mac OS is worse than on Windows and there is no MS SQL and PowerBI for this platform. The solution might be parallels with windows 11 installed, but I don't know if it works well. Can u give me some advice on choosing platform? Thanks in advance üòÅ.",True

@dangduy1806,2021-11-03T04:56:32Z,1,"Hello Luke! I would like to know more about extending 2 displays for M1 Mac. In the video, I saw that you used one Starlink hub USB 3.0 to HDMI (I'm clear with it). But for another display, you used another hub and connect to this display through the HDMI (or DP) port of this hub? Please correct me if I was wrong because I heard that this kind of setup will make them duplicated and finally, M1 will export to one external display only.",True
