Currently enrolled. Work full time in a Master Data/Systems Admin department. Recently delegated analyst duties to assist the current BI analyst at the company.

Have been considering a project to confirm the prediction of a ""27-30% rise in demand for Data Analysts by 2025"". I understand how large the task will be, but quite keen to plan and try it.

@jenkurtz412,2022-09-05T17:58:53Z,2,"This was really great, thank you. I am taking the Google course then will follow up with the IBM as well. Luckily, Coursera is such an economical solution to pick up new skills that bring relevant knowledge without the price tag of official college credits - which are just not always necessary depending on the roles and industries you work.  Additionally, I do think its great to think about the domain knowledge you can apply these new skills to - as opposed to expecting this cert to just get you a new job automatically. I think of the analyst as being a key storyteller in order to be impactful to executives and leaders making decisions. If you do not really understand the data you're attempting to speak to, you will never be seen as a credible advisor to any leadership.  You really need to be able to understand the data you're looking at, what you'd like to learn from it, what's in it for the leaders you're giving insight to.",True

I‚Äôm on course 6/8 and have mixed feelings about the certificate but overall think it was great and structured well.  Did I need the certificate? Not really, I already knew the technical skills the course offered so I‚Äôm not sure there is any benefit to me putting it on my resume.  Is it still worth taking? I think it is great for someone like me who has a degree that is science related but doesn‚Äôt have professional business experience. Like the guests mentioned it is heavy on the process and decision making. I learned a lot of buzz words and other information that will help me interview well and definitely helped me develop a solid resume.  Is this good for someone with no experience? Absolutely. As someone who already analyzes data and constantly creates methodology, I can say the structure of the course is really about getting you used to thinking analytically. It‚Äôs also a great intro to technical skills although these alone will not get you a job since it‚Äôs a little barebones.  Do I recommend the certificate? Yes but only if you have motivation. If you are serious about a career in data analytics this is a good precursor to your career you just have to want it and have patience. You aren‚Äôt going to want to hear this but this is likely a baby step to getting to that career. You have to continue to develop the technical skills, update your resume, and make a portfolio or git.",True

I'm 47-year old master of mechanical engineering, with 18-year engineering career, and I'm pretty passionate about data analytics, data science, as well as machine learning. I'm about to switch career, and I completed entire Google Analytics Professional Certificate over the 4-month period from July to November 2021, this year. My impressions are that the course is worth of attending, and considering that I'm not 100% beginner the first three were not very useful for me, as well as spreadsheets taking into account that I'm quite experience Excel user but SQL, R-language and the capstone project were excellent. Also a minus about this entire course is I would like to see more practicing, an instructor to lead the students through entire process of data analysis by using at least couple of practical examples!

It can cause you to miss out on great jobs that you could be qualified for based on your past experience. The data analyst skillset is very transferable, so it is important to keep an open mind while you job hunt. I was able to combine my previous customer support experience with the skills I acquired from this course to land a community research manager position. It took me about a month to get my official offer, but this course opened up a whole new career path that I didn't even know was available to me. Once I'm more settled in my new job, I plan on taking the Google Project Management course next so that I can meet the requirements for the CAPM exam. As far as the job search resources, I found that networking in real life did way more for me than anything they provided. I was able to interview for the job before it even became publicly available due to my networking efforts, so that is definitely another thing I would keep in mind.

I became a data analyst first, and am now in the process of rounding out the certs, degree, and general experience to build upon this career path I discovered and love! I am currently running through the Google Data Analytic certificate, and I agree a lot of the focus is ground level up, and some overlap on the basics that I already know. Having said that, it fills in a few knowledge gaps and makes that foundation even stronger. If someone in my situation has the time and ability to afford and take a cert like this, it gives a generally understood signal to employers or recruiters that those foundational ideas  (spreadsheets, basic data analytics and project management concepts) are a known skill. There are far worse ""unnecessary"" certs to have, especially considering the overall quality and name recognition of a Google cert.",True

If you like the implementation and/or system architecture (databases, implementation, parallelization, decentrallization,etc), you should still go study CS.

I think the expectation by many was that this certificate would instantly land them a job, or it would be as if Google would have facilitated their consortium of companies to reach out to every course completer, which is not the case. Overall, it was a very clean presentation of material which other providers have delivered in a very mundane way but it wasn't about job placement and in my opinion, I think that the majority of people that have completed the program won't mind that. However, some may have thought otherwise. I say take this program with a grain of salt as I had and think of it as a simple grouping of some data analysis concepts. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether they taught in R vs. Python. Go out now and learn how to clean, process, analyze, and visualize in Python if you like. Build a portfolio. Update your resume. Job search. I think with or without Google we all have to do our own home work.",True

This certificate alone won't help you land a job, it doesn't get you prepared for the on-job scenarios, cause it is very theory intensive at times 2. Could have focused more on practical uses and more exercises or challenges using your skills throughout  pros: 1. It's worth doing it and getting a start in the data field  suggestion: Would be if the course started as you being hired as a data analyst at Google and you get tasks and more on the job scenario of what a data analyst would do, learn as you go and solve the tasks kinda way, they had a few exercises like that, but, maybe the whole course should be insightful and learning and more doing experience of an actual data analyst at Google. and how they did the same tasks/exercises and their thought process, rather than people from google just endlessly taking.

@lenny8471,2021-07-01T06:35:44Z,4,"one of the main reason why i chose to do this certificate, aside from wanting to learn data analysis, is that it's offered by google. sometimes a program or a certificate is offered by an institute which is well known in the US but not where else, even some offered by major universities are not soooo well known outside of the US. but google is obviously a different story.",True
@walegbads,2021-07-01T06:19:41Z,55,Awesome video Luke! Interesting perspectives! Great to watch!,True
@rajagarwal4452,2021-07-01T05:58:22Z,6,If it is equivalent to a 4 years degree then why people are finding difficult to get a job. They have showcased the value of this course like one can easily land a job of 60k-70k USD but after watching this video its like the reality is quiet different. I am personally a little disappointed after completing this course because the end goal is to land a good job in a big company,True
@MSH3423,2021-07-01T05:36:52Z,1,Grrrr‚Ä¶. Got into #OMSA‚Ä¶ want to take IBM or Google‚Ä¶ but python aspect make me want to take IBM‚Ä¶ Thank you for the video Luke!,True

Im a recent graduate in bachelor in computer applications and i dont know which course i should do first because i want to do bothü§∑  Suggestions are appreciated.,True
@swatisingh4619,2021-07-01T05:30:29Z,3,Not me thinking about how to proceeed forward after getting certified ! And then this video pops up !,True
@megatahmadafiqahmadshukri961,2021-07-01T05:23:15Z,2,"Hai luke. Appreciate your videos. Im a mechanical engineer by background and I believe that in the future, data analysis skill will be huge, especially for lean manufacturing and six sigma analysis. Im planning to start the course this weekend. All the best to you in your career and everyone reading this.",True
@minnami778,2021-07-01T05:03:11Z,11,"Thank you Luke.  I finished this course and Excel is heavily focused (Google Sheet). It 's very little to analysis itself which should be a star of the show. The course is focus on soft skills,¬†presentation skill, knowing the tasks and tools available as data analyst. This course does not provide much of technical skills in depth on using tools for analysis.  Is it a good course? It's one of a kind in terms of introducing you to the world of Data Analyst in a broad picture.  On positive note, I learned and understand what is data analyst, the scope of the job, what should you expected to deliver, what technical skills you need.  I am satisfied about 80%.. There is some part that go beyond my expectation; Data Visualization , course resources. But there are parts that I am quite disappointed; Analysis(If you already took the course, you will understand),  Data Manipulations , SQL, Tableau, very few practical useful labs.  Conclusion: If I would had to choose again, would I take this course ?  Yes, I would. Is this course suitable for everyone who interested in Data field with zero knowledge? Yes, it is.",True

@changedman1816,2021-07-01T04:52:15Z,21,"Hey Luke, so I‚Äôm extremely excited about starting the google certification course for data analysis but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be a qualified candidate. I don‚Äôt have a four year degree that most jobs on the LinkedIn website requires for the positions. I‚Äôm a barber by craft looking for a career change. All of the graduates that you interviewed seemed to have gone to college, so my question is how likely do you believe I‚Äôll be at getting hired with just the certification being my only postsecondary education and a portfolio showing my skills.",True
@jagannathrath1914,2021-07-01T04:45:57Z,142,"The major difference between google and IBM certificate is R in google course and Python in IBM course. I would suggest to learn python after completing google certification because it also opens doors to data science and other coding related jobs which expands your range. However, it is a very nice course and teaches a lot of things like capstone and soft skills which is very essential for beginners. Best of luck",True
@vighneshchavan9226,2021-07-01T04:40:35Z,2,Thanks for the video,True
@sammitchell7310,2021-07-01T04:34:41Z,125,I figured the certificate alone wouldn‚Äôt get you a job. Google made it seems like the certificate would get you a job. The courses give you basic beginner level skills which is nice nonetheless.,True
