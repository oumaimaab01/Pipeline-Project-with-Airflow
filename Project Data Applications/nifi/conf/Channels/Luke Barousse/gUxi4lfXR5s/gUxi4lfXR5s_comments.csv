@layeeeeeTV,2023-01-05T12:35:19Z,7,The saying of “ you don’t really know what you’re talking about until you can teach a 12 year old” helped me out a ton when learning new stuff.   If I don’t have anyone I can teach what I’m learning. I often record myself in a voice memo and play it back to see if it makes sense. Technical skills can only go as far as you can communicate those findings.,True
