@AxaGarcia,2023-12-08T23:03:43Z,2,"Thank you for showing such an amazing workflow Luke! I'm a beginner but I'm definitely implementing this into my developing skill set.   I believe than rather than stealing our Data Analyst jobs, Data Analyst who are able to implement this AI tools within their skillset are going to standout against Data Analyst that refuse to use it. So it's better to learn this data analysis approaches to our benefit.  And who knows maybe tomorrow we can focus on being a Data Scientist because we've already automate the Data Analytics process since generative AI can improve over time, but we need to be there knowing how to use this AI tools to do so.",True

I would like to one day become like you and that is why I wanted to follow your steps and take the course you launched but the problem is that I cannot access the Chat-GPT 4 subscription, could you help me? I would very much like to learn from you and work with you to bring this world to more people and to be able to enrich my learning in my career. I was always told that to become what I set out to be, I should learn and be guided by the people who are what I want to become and that is undoubtedly you. Thank you very much, I hope you read my message ‚ù§",True

@landonman3959,2023-12-06T15:03:10Z,2,Just an fyi. SOC 2 compliance alone does not meet the specific requirements for handling PCI  or HIPAA data.  segmentation must ensure that out-of-scope components do not access in-scope components and that process isolation is a critical aspect of segmentation between virtual systems.,True
@landonman3959,2023-12-06T14:54:25Z,0,Is notable soc 2 compliant? You are exposing your data to at least two separate servers,True

@joeltorres1237,2023-12-06T14:09:45Z,3,Wow! You've convinced me. Having chatgpt is a must skill set now. Would you agree that being able to read/interpret the code is good enough and that moving forward with ai powered projects like this one is how we should learn and move forward?,True
