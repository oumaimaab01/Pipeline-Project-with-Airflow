It's a bummer for sites when a large part of their traffic is hobby project bots.  Secondly: web scraper often make mistakes as a site changes. I once had a sports scraper that started showing incorrect grades since the html I was scraping changed, it said Japan won the hockey gold medal. 🏅😂 and got a complaint that blamed the source site for being incorrect, when the issue was just my bad code.  So even if a site happily shares their data, they might wanna ban scrapers and provide apis instead: to guarantee that they get correct data.  providing public apis takes a long term commitment though just to handle versioning, since devs get so upset if you make breaking changes.",True
