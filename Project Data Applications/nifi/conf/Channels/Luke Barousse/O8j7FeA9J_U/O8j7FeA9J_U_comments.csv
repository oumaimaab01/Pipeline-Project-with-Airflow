@JW-mu4oh,2023-01-06T22:05:48Z,0,"Thanks for the tutorial Luke! I'm running into an error (3834C88E). I think it's because I have pivot tables in one of the tabs of the Google Spreadsheet that I'm importing. If I'm only interested in specific tabs within Google Sheets (ones that don't have a pivot), is it possible to remove those error-causing tabs from the import? Or does the entire workbook just always have to be clear of pivots. Any ways of circumventing the issue, like a third-party tool?",True

@michaellilly2550,2022-04-14T00:11:39Z,0,"Hey Luke,  thanks as always for all your tutorials and mentoring.  I don't know if you have a recommended reading list (apart from Storytelling With Data (I even found Cole's Google talk on her book)), but I would love it if you did.  If you did, I found a resource that I think you could endorse for Tableau:  ""Tableau Strategies: Solving Real, Practical  Problems With Data Analytics"" by Ann Jackson and Luke Stanke (O'Reilly, 2021). It's got lots of good stuff for datanerds.",True
