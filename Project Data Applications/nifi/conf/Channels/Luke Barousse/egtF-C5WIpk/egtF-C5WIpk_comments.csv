@jolness1,2022-04-07T19:35:15Z,175,"Python is notoriously hard to multithread though so it makes sense. For single thread of operations, they operate at almost exactly the same speed and unless you’re getting to the point where your saturating the heat sinks in the MacBook Air (8 or so minutes with all cores loaded) there will be no performance difference. On multi core aware apps, the m1 pro and max will be faster or in heavily memory bound stuff.   That said, the air is a HELL of a performer and with 16GB of memory, would last most folks 5yrs or more easily. We just got m1 max machines with 64GB (only reason we went max) of memory and it’s a huge jump vs my old 16” i9 machine.",True

Sure, this test case may show many people’s use case, but I am just saying that if you really wanted to get the best use of the potential of any chip with 2 and more cores, you would definitely implement multithreading. In that case, you really see the difference (approximately the same as shown at geekbench websites).",True
