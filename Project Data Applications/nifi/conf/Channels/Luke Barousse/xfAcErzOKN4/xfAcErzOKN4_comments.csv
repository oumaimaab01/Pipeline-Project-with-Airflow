Then i tried with anaconda prompt, it worked and showed all the packages. Do you have an idea of why it doesn't work with cmd plz? is it the PATH issue?",True

@nathenmiranda2822,2022-02-14T21:57:12Z,4,"Hey dude. I'm fairly new at this stuff. Getting caught up on all your videos. Quality content. So I saved anaconda in C:\Users\'name' rather than C:\ProgramData. When verifying installation and running cmd 'conda list' it says..."" 'conda' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file."" Is this because the term 'conda' has been changed since this video or is it because I saved it in a different location?",True

However, 90 percent of them tutorials are taught with spyder, but I cannot launch spyder on my windows 11, even after reinstalling it a few times, I tried both through anaconda and on its own, yet it does not launch. I tried ""for me"" and the other option, I deleted all python related apps and files but still could not solve the issue.  I have had two types of issues,   1st one showing when I launch spyder through ""active page code 949"" and not launching  2nd one is this.
