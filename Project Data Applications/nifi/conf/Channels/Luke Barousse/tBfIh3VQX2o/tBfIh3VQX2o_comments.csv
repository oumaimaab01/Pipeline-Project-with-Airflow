@EricVulgaris,2022-06-13T09:35:30Z,0,"Knowing the various data distributions is essential to the job as arithmetic if you're looking to be more than be a chart farmer.   It's important for troubleshooting your dataset and provide that analysis that stakeholders really want. Cuz your bosses don't want just a chart. They want the answer to the question the chart supports. The story (or context for decisions) requires a firm understanding of data sampling, biases, and distributions and how that relates to the business. This part of stats is IMHO so much more vital than knowing probabilities.   Like if youre a new hire, prepare to be shocked the number of times bosses make decisions around an ""average"" from a data set when the distribution isn't gaussian (e.g. ARPU is good for budgetary forecasting but not for detailed sales measurements)",True

I am looking for a new computer, and PyTorch just released an update stating that they will  soon be able to support building models on the Apple Silicone GPU architecture. It's a really tempting purchase, but if I get the thing fully spec'ed out, it's a bankrupting amount of money.

@dard4642,2022-06-11T04:16:26Z,0,"There is a lot of integral calculus hidden within statistical distributions. The area under a normal distribution (the integral of that curve) is equal to 1 and a z-score of 1.96 (Z = 1.96) corresponds to the alternative hypothesis being in the first 0.95 of the integral, where 1.96 in the upper limit of integration on the interval of x under the curve. Z=1.68 is the upper limit of integration for 0.9 of the integral, etc. I get that this is formal calculus and probably isn't used by too many data analysts but I find that learning integral calculus first really helps people have a better intuition and understanding of statistical distributions.

@JoshBabin,2022-06-10T18:34:10Z,4,"Another sweet video my dude.   One thought: on the distribution plot, it marks 50% at the peak of the curve. While this is true on a normal distribution (where mean=median=mode), your specific distribution was skewed to the right. So the 50th percentile would have been to the right of the mode (peak of curve).  Unless I'm wrong, then you should thoroughly pwn me lol",True
