@TAHJBecomeYourBestSelf,2023-03-14T01:32:05Z,21,I need a full YouTube video on this. Iâ€™ve always asked how much statistics does a data analyst use on a day to day basis.,True

@chacmool2581,2023-09-29T01:32:56Z,0,"Great, you've got a dataset that looks to be more or less normally distributed. A simple test is to compare the mean and the median, knowing that in a perfectly Normal distribution, the mean and the median are equal. If the mean and median are far apart, you are likely looking a distribution that differs significantly from normality. If you want to test it formally that it does indeed follow a Gaussian distribution (the tech name for Normal), you do a Wilks-Shapiro test or by visual inspection of a Q-Q plot. The Excel gurus will tell us how to do that in Excel. Cuz if it ain't normal, the characteristics begin to break down. What are some of the characteristics? In a Gaussian distribution, 68%, 95% and 99.7% of data points fall within one, two and three standard deviations plus/minus from the mean, respectively.  A Gaussian distribution is fully described by two parameters, the mean and the standard deviation. Once you calculate those two parameters, you can begin to answer more interesting questions like: * Given this distribution/dataset, what is the probability of making, say, $99,000? * What percentage of people make at least, say, $95,000?  These are the interesting questions for which you'll need to understand Probability.  Finally ""knowing"" Statistics means knowing all the assumptions and knowing how to test for them so one's conclusions based on the characteristics of the distribution in question are sound and justified.",True

@snitox,2023-06-04T17:36:39Z,5,Btw this is descriptive statistics. You need something like sampled data to make inferential statistics.,True

@mikehawk4583,2023-03-13T22:02:39Z,0,stop calling these things statistics. if it's something a middle schooler understands it ain't stats...,True
