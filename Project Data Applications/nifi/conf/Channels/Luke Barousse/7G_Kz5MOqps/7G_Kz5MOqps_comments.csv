@nessim.liamani,2024-05-09T11:16:42Z,0,"ChatGPT Summary :   In the last video, the creator highlighted a significant issue in the data science industry regarding the mismatch between recommended skills and actual job postings. They built an app analyzing data analyst job posts in the US and discovered outdated recommendations lacking evidence. The Stack Overflow developer survey inspired them to create a similar survey for data professionals. However, they faced challenges such as limited data for data professionals and technical issues with their app.  To address these issues, they embarked on building a new solution. They utilized Python to connect to an API, collecting job data globally. They engaged a data engineer to refine the data pipeline using tools like Airflow for scheduling and BigQuery for data warehousing. They also employed Spark clusters for processing large datasets efficiently.  After cleaning the data, they delved into exploring salary and skills. They found discrepancies in salary ranges in job postings and used median values for accuracy. They also identified the most in-demand skills for different roles, emphasizing SQL and Python for data professionals.  To provide accessible insights, they developed a web app using Streamlit, allowing users to filter job postings by title and explore skills and salaries. Users can now make informed decisions about skill acquisition based on real-time data.  Overall, their journey involved overcoming challenges in data collection, processing, and analysis to create a valuable resource for data professionals. They continue to seek feedback for further improvements to the website.  | Key Points | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | - Identified a gap between recommended skills and actual job postings in data science. | | - Built an app analyzing US data analyst job posts but faced technical issues and limited data. | | - Developed a new solution, collecting global job data using Python, Airflow, and Spark clusters. | | - Explored salary and skill data, highlighting discrepancies in salary ranges and in-demand skills. | | - Created a web app using Streamlit for users to access real-time insights on skills and salaries. | | - Open to feedback for improving the website and continuing data collection for future analysis. |",True

Since the video is 2 month old, may be comparision with past data would be super handful! *  It would be great to further enhance this data with a roadmap related to earnings. Mostly people lookout for a specific salary bracket and if they can just select a salary range, they can be showed with the skillset required in order to attain the same. Right now too we can get to below information but it would be great to just see it in a single glance rather than switching between multiple radio boxes.  e.g: Select Salary range: 150k to 200k Languages : ..

Targeting a ""top skill"" means that you will throw yourself into competition with a HUGE number of people. The way you make the big bucks and land elite positions, in such a situation, is by being among the top in that ocean of talent. For all but a few the path of ""top skills"" means competing (often globally) with people who are willing to paid far less than you are.  There's a case to made to instead target ""niche"" skills. It's much more feasible to become a top-choice in a lesser known technology. Ironically, it gives you more power in the job market because there's less competition. Is targeting niche skills for everyone? By definition, no, but that's the case for almost everything. Bottom line is there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to this problem.",True

Without your transparent work, a chatGPT answer isn't any more use than all those websites you looked at that which were different from the job application data, and its worded in just as convincing language.   Honest though: I'm a data analyst and I am scared of the medium term future! Hopefully its just neo-phobia though and it will pass as I find a place in it all. I think its just the proximity of probably upcoming great change that is scary, combined with watching too many YouTube videos of the current guesses about what A.I. will do, which are often delivered in a polarised good/bad way which is unsettling. Once we start to see it play out more, all the real actual opportunities (many of which we can't guess yet) will start springing out more obviously. I hope.     Q to chatGPT: ""What are the top 5 tools that data analysts need to be proficient in, in the USA?""  A from chatGPT: ""The top tools that data analysts need to be proficient in can vary depending on the industry, company, and geographic location. However, here are the top five tools that are commonly used and in demand for data analysts in the USA:  SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a must-have tool for data analysts in the USA, as most companies store their data in relational databases. Knowledge of SQL is critical for extracting, transforming, and querying data for analysis.  Excel: Microsoft Excel is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, and it is widely used by data analysts in the USA. Excel proficiency is essential for creating pivot tables, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing data.  Python: Python is a popular programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Python proficiency is in high demand for data analysts in the USA, especially for working with large datasets, building models, and automating data workflows.  Tableau: Tableau is a popular data visualization tool used to create interactive dashboards and reports. Data analysts in the USA who are proficient in Tableau can create compelling visualizations that communicate data insights to stakeholders effectively.  R: R is a programming language commonly used for statistical analysis and data visualization. Although not as widely used as Python in the USA, proficiency in R is still a valuable skill for data analysts working in fields like finance and healthcare.""",True

Although I still think the volume for the wage is overblown, for example, Luke just created this database almost by himself which answers the question for an entire industry. It seems it took him a few weeks of solid work to get this done. So realistically, how many data workers do you actually need worldwide? I feel like most of them are just doing work that other people have done elsewhere, but hasn't been monetized/shared via an app.  i.e 10 data analysts make 10 internal applications for 10 companies and are all paid $120k/year. Rather than making a singular app and then licensing that app out to all 10 companies, those 10 companies have each spent probably $40,000 worrth of time and investment to make the same thing, i.e 400k to solve a 40k problem.

Last week? Last month?  It would be got to see the period of time for the data shown and/or have a date slicers.   Thanks mate!",True

I referred a friend of mine to your site to check it out,  she told me almost everything is for senior or data scientists, which she is not.  She is a junior developer. And she was right.  This site needs to add lower tier positions, so its much easier for those people to look at the data regarding their particular type of jobs they are looking for. I myself can't find things for DevOps engineers on any level.  Instead of just restricting this site to only data engineering positions and pay, would be nice to include everyone else.

@JustAn0therSoul,2023-02-17T18:47:26Z,1,"The Site seems fairly slow. Maybe you should use some kind of caching. Its a bit wierd that for example i click on salery then the annual incomes loads, i select hourly, it loads, then i go back to annual and it loads again.  Is the python script in the background running all the time and automaticly updating the database? This would be not good. I mean have it run all the time if you want. But the Data people request does not need to be a live view of the data in the database. Instead pre-render all selection options on the site, once per day or week or months. So that you have just this pre-rendered html file that is handed out instead of having all this huge loading / calculations / databank calls / ... being done with every single visitor.  Despite my critism, this is really a job done well. I like the style you present the data and i appreciate all the effort you put in to it. üëç",True

@martinquick614,2023-02-17T17:22:56Z,0,"Perhaps an automated way of identifying what skills are mentioned in job postings would be to see what terms are mentioned more often in your dataset of postings than in ""typical"" (i.e., unrelated to data work) English phrases. I don't work with NLP much so don't have a specific dataset in mind, but there must be good word probability datasets out there. For example, if the likelihood of a term in your dataset being ""SQL"" is 0.5%, but in ordinary phrases it is 0.0001%, then you can assume it's a skill specific to data work",True

@vectoralphaAI,2023-02-17T14:49:51Z,0,Awesome I used your website yesterday night. You're an inspiration. I do have one improvement or fix that would make the website better. When I was using it the drop down box had a lot of repeat jobs like multiple data analysts and Data scientist  roles that were the same name but different data. That seems off to me. Shouldn't there be only one Data Analyst term instead of multiple? Anyway looking forward to more of your content.,True
