@cjn211,2023-09-19T21:32:09Z,0,"Hey Luke, I‚Äôm in the process of changing careers to be a data analyst. I‚Äôm currently taking Google‚Äôs Data analytics professional certificate course on coursera. I‚Äôm on module 7 of 8 and to be honest , feeling a bit overwhelmed, in that I don‚Äôt feel like I remember 1/2 the stuff I‚Äôve already completed. The course structure of watching a 5 min video, take a quiz with a few questions and then have to go do it is hard for me. I‚Äôm the type that if I sat with you or another professional for a month and practicing, I‚Äôd be 10xs better than I am since starting this course on cousera. There‚Äôs not much repetition on there and that‚Äôs how I learn best- hands on and repetition .  Was never a computer person, but I‚Äôm very analytical. Started on wall sr couple years after HS- No college degree- I know I can do this and I know once I know what I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôll crush it. Any feedback , advice, recommendations are greatly appreciated. Are there any sort of programs or courses for excel/sheets, SQL, tableau, R , python that are interactive where they give immediate feedback and also where I can get lots of reps? Again, thanks",True

@joshellis4966,2022-09-24T01:23:15Z,1,"Hi Luke! Nice video! I am curious of your standard method(s) for data collection from SAP? SAP is my company's ERP system, however our business is challenged with analyzing that data outside of SAP or in any analytical tool.   Unfortunately, the only method I am aware of is from the presentation layer, which isn't really ideal. There are transactions like SQVI, SQ01/02/03 that allow for query design in the presentation layer, but are quite limited. It feels odd that I have never actually written a SQL query via an editor to query our ERP data. These are just .txt or .xls extracts to a local machine, and that's about it. I want to know how to truly explore our ERP system with SQL.  SAP is so expansive, so starting for scratch using it as a source for data collection just feels like situation of ""You only know what you know"", and there really isn't anyone who knows otherwise to learn from.",True
