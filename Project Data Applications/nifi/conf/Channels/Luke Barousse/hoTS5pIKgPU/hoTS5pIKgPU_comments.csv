There is absolute truth in 80/20 on this topic and because I never had anyone to prepare the 80%, I had to do it myself and that was great learning - sure AI could figure out a lot of things at a great speed...

@AusFastLife,2023-07-30T23:16:37Z,2,"New technologies do change the work environment.  I am always of the opinion that if a task can be automated, it should be automated, to free people up to do tasks that only people can do.  But I don't think it is true that new technology always makes the role of a person obsolete, but rather the role of the person changes to incorporate the new technology.  Technology doesn't so much replace a person but rather becomes a tool that allows a person to do their job better and faster, which is essentially what Luke says in the video (3:01).  Look at all fields of work, there will generally be some form of technology that as people we use to be more efficient.  Imagine if transport drivers didn't have their big rigs and had to deliver goods in family sedans or horse and carts.  Trucks didn't take away their jobs it allowed them to do it better, faster and more efficiently.  In data analysis, is anyone suggesting we should go back to slide rules and human calculators (as shown in the movie Hidden Figures)?  I work as a technical writer, and chat bots are VERY good at writing in human styles.  You can get a chatbod to write up a technical document, but it takes considerable promting and refining.  Plus you then have to take what a Chatbot puts out and customise it to your specific use case or company's needs.  Also if you have a particular layout that you need or particular sections that you would like to add because you personally think that it makes a given document clearer and easier to use it again takes considerable prompting and skill on the part of the human to get the chat bot to do it.  Lastly, a major component of human roles in a company is accountability.  Someone has to be accountable for the work that is produced and stand by its accuracy.  Whatever a Chatbot produces has to be stringently checked by a person to ensure it is correct and that person who themselves must be an expert in that topic must sign off on the work and confirm that yes, this piece of work satisfies the quality standard of this employer.  All of these new technologies are just tools.  And like any tool they would just sit around on the bench unless there was a person to use them.  Of course anyone can pick up a tool and use it.  You don't have to be particularly trained to use a hammer or a screw driver or a sander, but in the hands of a master those same tools can be used to make some extraordinary things.  I don't think AI is going to replace humans, but humans are going to find some amazing use cases and will use the tools to do things that they weren't able to do before.",True

I think that the limitiations you mentioned in the video will be overcome in time, in particular and in general. However, I don't think all data analysts (especially entry-level ones) will have a hard time finding a job anytime soon. Consider how long it takes small and midsize companies to migrate to Excel.

@sumbularshi1834,2023-07-27T07:16:16Z,2,"I asked ChatGPT about its Code Interpreter, and here is the response (I wish I could attach the screenshot)  ""As of my last update in September 2021, there was no specific feature called ""ChatGPT's Code Interpreter."" However, I can provide some insights into how a language model like ChatGPT can be utilized for code interpretation and execution.  ChatGPT is a language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. It is based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture, which is a variant of the GPT-3 model. While GPT-3.5 doesn't have a built-in code interpreter, developers can leverage its natural language understanding and generation capabilities to create code interpretation and execution functionalities.  To use ChatGPT for code interpretation, developers would typically follow these steps:  1. Integration: Developers can integrate ChatGPT into their applications or systems using APIs provided by OpenAI. Through API calls, the model can receive text input and generate text output based on its training data.  2. Input Processing: Users can send natural language commands or queries that include code-related instructions to the model via the API. For example, a user might input a command like, ""Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.""  3. Code Generation: ChatGPT will process the input and generate a response that contains the code interpretation based on its training data. For the above example, the model may generate Python code for calculating the factorial of a number.  4. Code Execution (Optional): Depending on the implementation, the generated code can be further executed by an underlying code execution engine or interpreter. This step is optional, as some applications may only provide code interpretation without direct execution.  It's essential to note that utilizing a language model like ChatGPT for code interpretation and execution has several considerations:  * Security: Allowing a model to execute code poses security risks, as it might execute malicious code if not properly restricted.  * Reliability: While GPT-3.5 is a powerful model, it may not be perfect in generating correct and optimized code.  * Limitations: GPT-3.5 has a token limit for each API call, meaning lengthy code might be challenging to handle within a single API interaction.  Since my knowledge is limited to September 2021, there might have been updates or improvements in the capabilities and features of ChatGPT or other similar language models. I recommend checking the official OpenAI documentation or release notes for the most up-to-date information on using ChatGPT or related models for code interpretation.""",True
