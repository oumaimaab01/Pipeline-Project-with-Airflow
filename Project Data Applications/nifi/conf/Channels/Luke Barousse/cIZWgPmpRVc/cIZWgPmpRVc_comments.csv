@michaellilly2550,2022-04-11T01:36:22Z,0,"Hi Luke, thanks for all your hard work motivating and informing all us #JuniorDataNerds !  Somewhere among your videos you mentioned resources for creating portfolio website (or was it creating a personal , professional page for data analytics?). Heck, it could even be this video, (and if so, I guess I'm the goober) but now I can't find it, so was hoping you could point me (again) to your recommendations, or prepare a video on making your own page.   I am just starting my data analyst journey (as can be seen from my earlier dorky comments) and want to prepare just such a  webpage to show off where I am coming from, where I am,  and where I am going, professionally speaking. I want to make it as comprehensive as possible. Thanks.",True

@PeterHontaru,2021-09-06T22:11:12Z,10,"Excellent video! Highly recommend everyone not just to do projects for jobs but for their own learning experience. At the beginning of this year I wanted to learn to build apps in Shiny and ended up building one to predict how long it will take to learn a piano piece based on its difficulty, length, genre, etc. This was possible because I compiled over 1,200 hours of practice (by piece) in the last 3-4 years so thought Id make use of it. It also taught me how to use APIs to get that data which the titanic dataset doesn‚Äôt really teach so yet another point for personal projectsüòÖ Not only that this was always a topic when I interviewed for DS roles but I also submitted it to the R Studio annual contest and won a notable mention. This is not the grand prize or anything but I was competing against full time shiny developers as someone that learnt this on the side for a couple months so was pretty proud of myself lol",True

I constantly use SQL and work with data in my job, but the data is highly confidential so I cannot share it (I work in a government position - law enforcement). This is also the only professional job I've had, so do you agree that it makes sense to do data analysis projects on my own to add to my portfolio, or can I simply state the various accomplishments I have made in my current job? Another question I have is what is a good company or field to work in remotely? Guess that depends on my interests, but I am open to expanding those.",True
