@t2udu,2022-05-17T15:01:01Z,0,"This video came in time for me. I have a project that I thought was just fine for getting data from a website that updates its stats on players and teams in the EPL (English Premier League). I scraped the site using python with the aid of Selenium, Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries, then I used pandas to load the data and clean it up, the n matplotlib to visualize that data. All of that was done in Jupyter Labs IDE, and for me it was fine. But now I'm thinking of exactly what you're trying to do, because I need to look at historical trends for even better analysis, which a database would be useful for, and I need even better and more seamless visualization which I'm thinking Tableau would be useful for. Long story short, my roadblocks are first getting a database to load it into every game week, and also to find a way to get the code to run that automatically (preferably on the cloud, I was thinking AWS Lsmbda but I'm still learning about that).   Any help on this is greatly appreciated.",True

@speedspeed121,2022-03-24T13:19:56Z,0,"I am a bit more than halfway done with my project. This is what I did/am doing: 1. Imagined I was a consultant who received a problem from a client: They want to know where they should place new shops 2. I created a few questions of my own: a. if I combine all of the zip codes in a greater area, are there fewer existing shops in certain zip codes? b. is there a correlation between income or population and the number of shops in the zip code (ie. does the average income mean there will be more shops).  3. Collected my data from two sources: State license to find out where the shops are located and census income/zip data.  4. Cleaned the data.  5. Today I will do my calculations and predictions from above then decide if I can come up with more questions. 6. Make my predictions presentable for the general public. Then I will package it for opinions online (Kaggle? )",True
