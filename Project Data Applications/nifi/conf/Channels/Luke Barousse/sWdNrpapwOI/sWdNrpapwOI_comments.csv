@LuvLuke954,2023-01-11T21:45:26Z,1,I think this is one of the real truths of why I finally realized my passion is in Data. I LOVE learning. And researching! Always looking for answers. Family thinks I should’ve been a lawyer  & my husband calls me his little forensic scientist. Lol.  In almost all fields - it is what it is. A daily grind of rote work - even if the clients are different. There is ALWAYS something new going on and something to learn for a better outcome and for future projects.  I love it. ❤,True
