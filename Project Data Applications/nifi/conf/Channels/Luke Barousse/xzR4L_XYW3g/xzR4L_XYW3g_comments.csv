@naterod4515,2021-02-22T15:26:26Z,0,For longevity and price which would you choose?  7core Air 16gb RAM 256gb  8core pro 8gb RAM 256gb  The price difference isn‚Äôt much but will I get a longer use out of the pro since it has the fan but not sacrifice a performance loss in a lower ram?,True
@israelperezvargas9866,2021-02-16T03:00:45Z,6,"hello, congratulations on your channel. What would you recommend me? Macbook air with m1 16gb ram and 256 storage or macbook pro with m1 8gb ram and 256gb storage",True

@paxdriver,2021-01-30T00:03:32Z,0,"Your channel is coming along nicely! I offer constructive criticism just to help: if you could try to limit the way your tone rises at the end of a statement to questions or conditionals, it's really hard for some people to listen to the ""valley girl"" (for lack of a better term) way of speaking. For eg ""if money is a concern..."" [fine] ""... I highly recommend just going with the lowest option..."" [no need for inflection there, it's distracting]  New sub, looking forward to watching your channel grow dude",True
@warlockhaseo3642,2021-01-29T02:51:32Z,0,MacBook Air and SSH is another good option.,True

@ushuaia213,2021-01-22T08:47:50Z,53,"This is my first mac,  using a lot of R and Python, works fantastic. The battery is insane, going to 3 hour classes without the charger and coming back with over 75% or even 80% battery is just next level.  The soundless thing is also extremely comforting, specially when i try to use my also expensive laptop with ubuntu and windows that spins the fans whenever you do the most basic task",True

@VenkatDinesh02,2021-01-19T19:22:28Z,0,Crisp and clear explanation.I am pursing post graduation course In data science . I bought  8gb M1 MacBook Pro. Is is fine ?,True
@jono601,2021-01-19T13:47:25Z,4,256 gb is a bit too low. you constantly have to watch out for large apps and downloads. I find this micromanaging of storage unproductive and not worth the savings if you use it for work. Just get the 500 gb option so you don't have to watch your internal storage like a hawk. Hanging a storage drive off your computer is fine if you keep your laptop on your desk all the time. just note there's only 2 ports so even less reason to permanently plug up one of the ports with a hanging storage drive. Just be prepared to be constantly stressed about storage if you get the 256gb one.,True

@TheEmrobe,2021-01-18T01:16:18Z,1,"""For data science..."" Look, when your review summarizes memory and storage options, GPU load + some other irrelevant shit and NOT the only relevant question - x86 VS ARM software compatibility, it tells me one thing. You are not a data scientist, you are someone who uses a spreadsheet. I'm sorry, but this is not a very good review.",True

@simonnmorgan,2021-01-13T08:37:28Z,5,"The more important question is, should you be getting an M1 for data science in the first place. I pulled the trigger on a new Mac Mini few days ago but discovered many DS tools still don't have native versions. For people doing professional DS work probably better to still wait until more software vendors provide native ports.",True

@thaivunguyen8728,2021-01-08T12:23:01Z,39,"A problem in the video is missing information on how mac utilizes memory. The more memory you have, the more mac uses it. So, in normal usages, having 8gb and 16gb is not that different, even in the case you‚Äôre calling extreme here. For DS, i believe only when you working with a really large data set that 16gb will prove its benefits.",True
