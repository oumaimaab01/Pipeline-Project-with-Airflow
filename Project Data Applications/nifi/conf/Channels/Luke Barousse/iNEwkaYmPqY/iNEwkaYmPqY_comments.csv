It's a great class, but I am curious about something.  I am struggling to figure out how and when to use those concepts currently.  For example, I know how to use while loops or I know how to create classes with attributes and methods, but what I'm struggling with is how to know when to use those for projects.  Does this just come with time and practice or does that fact I don't know that mean I have yet to completely absorb the lesson?  I guess a simpler way to say that is my questions aren't about the code itself and how it works, it's the application of it. When practicing I am struggling with looking at it and going ""Oh yes, of course, I need to use this and that, and put one of these in here"".  Does that make sense?  I am hoping that will just come with more and more practice and real world application, but I don't know.",True

@themekfrommars,2023-01-15T15:07:35Z,0,"Hi, it was nice to see your video. I've been doing this sort of activity since before there were data analyst roles. My first reaction is you haven't shown me why I would use python vs other tools. I can do all of this more easily in Power Query, or Alteryx or if open source is important, Pentaho data integration. And each of these tools would leave a better, less impenetrable audit trail for the next guy. So why use python? I have used it for basic scripting (e.g. extract XML tags), convenience simple repeat ETL, and batch files to link other fragments of processing. What else is it good for?

Simply extracting the name Python might not be accurate. - For the % calculation are the instances of a skill reduced to 1 per JD? e.g if SQL is mentioned multiple times in a JD - it should only count as once :),True
