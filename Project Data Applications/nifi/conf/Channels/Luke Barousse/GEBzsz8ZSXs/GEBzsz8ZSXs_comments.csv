@mclovin6042,2022-06-09T22:05:43Z,1,I just want to say thank you!! I just finished up my google certification and I'm now creating my portfolio projects for my resume. I kept on running into problems with biqquery and from my research i realize that its much more tedious than it needs to be since all of my data is coming externally and most of the time through xslx files. Although bigquery is convenient i do see the limitations in it. Best way I can explain it is like jumping through unnecessary hoops when there is a much easier way to reach the end.  I started searching other SQL options and this video summed it all up! It never occurred to me that these more popular databases and query editors didnt come in a big package like the google cloud platform. I think thats one thing the google cert failed to expand upon. Or maybe i just missed that :)   One question do you think i should continue using the google cloud platform since im most familiar with it or search through other SQL means like my PostgreSQL and VS code?,True

Software Development (They branch into General Software Development and Game development) 2. Graphic Design 3. IT Security 4. Data Data is actually the least popular one because regarded Game Dev and IT Security (aka hacker wannabes) as the ""cool kid"" jobs. While graphic design is the general path for anyone since it doesn't involve much or any coding. Data is seen as this boring desk job of looking at mountains of tables and spreadsheet apparently, only recently that we got lots of new students who's actually prefer data because they see it as an easy get-rich career path (thanks to numerous data scientist bloggers telling their success story online lol).  Notes: Basically people in the same class year as me are mostly joining IT for the hype that ""easier to get a job as an IT"" or the ""anti-mainstream"" bs.
