@jimpauls7765,2022-10-22T22:32:20Z,0,"As always top-notch quality from Master Luke DataWalker :)  Quick question please! At 22:00, how exactly does the ""previous_item"" variable work properly?   When the condition initializes the item that matches the condition is (let's say) at position X in the list. How on science's green earth, we do retrieve the X - 1 position? (meaning with pull the sentence before our condition statement?)  I presume when the [for statement] takes takes effect the [item] is in X - 1 position (i.e. previous sentence), and it is only when the nested [if statement] takes effect that the [item] receives the position required by our condition?  Thank you!",True

I wanted to ask you, in the last episode of this video you create the variable 'previous_item' and it's = item, I don't understand how it returns the previous line, aren't you asking to 'previous_item' to be equal to item?",True

[closes door and locks it]"").   :( :( I tried and tried to understand why, but without success. Where does this issue come from? Thanks in advance...",True
