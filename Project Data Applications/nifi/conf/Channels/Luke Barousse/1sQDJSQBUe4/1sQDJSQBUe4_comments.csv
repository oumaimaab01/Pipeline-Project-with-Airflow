Please! 🙏🤞 I'm a content creator (which of course includes video editing, recording my screen and illustration) but also I'm currently learning data analyst skills such as Excel and Python. I've been checking out some of the M2 Mac settings for when I have enough money saved to upgrade my laptop (I'm using a MacBook Pro from Mid 2012, still going strong, it has only failed me once hence why I'm looking for another Mac rather than a PC. I've used 2 Dell PCs and eventually they stopped working properly after a 4 or 5 years of use).  What worries me a bit is that I might not be able to find a lot of IOS apps to continue learning about data analysis such as SQL, Macros or Power BI. I'm sorry if my comment seems silly, I'm still a noob when it comes to data analysis 😅. Thank you for uploading your videos, they have been very useful for me to learn new things and maybe eventually have a career change in the future (unfortunately in my country being a digital illustrator sometimes doesn't pay the bills).

@timsmith8489,2022-04-05T16:08:18Z,0,"As far as storage goes, I'd take into account that the larger SSD options typically also have a proportionally longer lifetime in terms of terrabytes written (TBW), so if one plans to keep their Mac a long time I'd be careful about getting a combination of both low RAM and low storage lest swapping due to the low RAM combined with the relatively low TBW of the small SSD significantly shortens your Mac's life. Personally I'd figure out how much space I need for files on the internal SSD, taking into account my best guess at growth over the time I hope to keep the Mac, find the smallest configuration bigger than that, and then go up on step. If I anticipated usage that involved a lot of storage of large amounts of temporary on the internal SSD I might go up another step.",True

@briancase6180,2021-12-09T21:06:06Z,11,"Great video analysis; thanks! But I would add a couple of points. As for M1 machines: the extra money for the 13"" Pro over the Air can be justified by: extra screen brightness and extra battery life. Just something to think about. As for the 14"" machine: same things: bigger battery and FABULOUS (and meaningfully larger) screen. If you work on battery and your eyes can get tired, then the screen and battery capacity can matter a lot. I also expect support for Metal and the M1 GPUs in general will increase dramatically. There will likely be a dramatic gain in the relative performance of the big GPUs in the Pro and Mac chips. I expect also better support for VMs in general. At that point, while16GB of memory feels good now, remember at one time not long ago, so did 1GB. Just a couple thoughts.",True
