@logaandm,2021-02-14T21:32:47Z,58,"Windows on ARM works just fine and has been on ARM since 2012. The Surface Pro X has been running Windows 10 on 64 bit ARM for more than a year. Recent developer releases allow for x64 emulation and so far I have been impressed with the stability although performance is not great. As a light productivity machine, it is hard to beat the Surface Pro X.  Windows on M1 is the issue and there are two problems:  1. Apple does not license Windows on ARM, so currently there is no legal way to run Windows on the M1 except for the developer version - which by definition is not a stable version of Windows.  2. The biggest problems with Windows on ARM are device drivers - these have to be supplied by the hardware maker, i.e. Apple, or software vender in the case of virtual machines, e.g. Parallels. Since Windows on ARM works just fine on licensed hardware, the problem is Apple not Microsoft.  Ultimately Windows on the M1 is going to come down to the chances of:  A: Apple licensing Windows as an OEM. Hmmm. Not very likely.   Sadly this may be Microsofts goal - to force Apple to buy a license of Windows for all M1 Macs. Microsoft has limited interest in selling hardware, it has great interest in selling Windows to corporations. Microsofts ""eco-system"" is corporate services and that means Office, OneDrive, Exchange and other corporate data services. Apple's mostly closed eco-system is not compatible with Corporate business requirements which demands different licensing strategies and longer software/hardware support than Apple is willing to give. There is a reason Windows 10 works just fine on 15 year old MacBooks. There is a reason the Surface connect still exists - backwards compatibility. You don't tell the US Government you no longer support the 1 million PC's they bought 5 years ago when they are paying millions for ongoing data services.  B: Windows providing consumer versions of Windows for ARM, and Apple supplying drivers.   I am not as optimistic, at least in the near term. Microsoft has almost no motivation to change it's policies in the near term. Microsoft may change this policy once there is a viable market on the PC makers sides of things. Not only does Microsoft build it's own ARM based PC's, but Microsoft' interests are best served by having a large competitive PC market on the ARM side of things driving down prices and encouraging innovation. Apple likes a closed system where it can keep prices up. In addition, Apple has a long history of supplying degraded drivers for it's hardware which makes Windows ""look"" bad on Apple hardware. Specifically, Bluetooth audio, Graphics, and touch pad drivers supplied by Apple in Bootcamp have been historically sources of poor performance on Macbook running Windows. In short, Microsoft has little motivation, monetary or otherwise to help Apple out. In 1-2 years PC laptops with ARM based processors with comparable performance to the M1 will be on the market. At that point what will Microsoft do? ""Ya dance with the one that brung ya."" Microsoft is just as likely to shut Apple out of Windows on ARM so that Dell, HP, Lenovo and others can continue to dominate the business computing world - with Windows pre-installed - which is what serves Microsoft best.  I have no doubt the teams at Apple knew all this and went ahead with the switch to ARM anyway. That is because Apple is not a corporate services company, it is a consumer services company. So Apple has little motivation to actually have Windows work on their ARM machines. As long as people can use Web based services to access the office, that is good enough for Apple. So, Apple's goal is to turn the PC into the next iPhone, a ubiquitous consumer device. I doubt that is going to happen because for most people their laptop or PC has to server double duty as a personal device and something to do office work on. As soon as office work is required, that means some piece of software which requires actual Windows. I suspect Apple will be satisfied with it's continued 10-15% of the market as long as they are really tied into the Apple Eco-system of services. In any event, the next few years will be interesting and the prospect of another PowerPC type of thing happening is very real but this time in the software domain rather than the hardware domain.  Long and short of it, Windows on M1 - don't hold your breath.",True
