@abuzarabbas7132,2021-07-12T13:57:42Z,0,Great stuff taught in comprehensible way. I want your advice that how to actually retain Pandas or SQL syntax. Should I go through lectures and practice along with it. Or just finish entire module and then take up projects. Since there are too many commands and its really difficult to recall them all the time. I end up wasting time chunk of time in correcting syntax to get desired result. Really difficult to recall exact command/syntax unless going back and forth to documentation. Appreciate your assistance.,True
