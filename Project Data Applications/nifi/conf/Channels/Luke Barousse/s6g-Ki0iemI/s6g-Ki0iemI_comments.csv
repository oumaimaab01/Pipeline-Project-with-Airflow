Even for your sample file, gsearch_jobs, I'm getting this message:  ""..... It seems my attempt to execute the code did not proceed as expected again, leading to no output or error message provided. This situation continues to indicate a technical limitation in processing the request within this environment.  Given the repeated difficulties in processing file-based requests, I recommend analyzing the data using dedicated software or tools designed for data analysis, such as Python in a local development environment, R, Excel, or Google Sheets. These platforms can handle large datasets more efficiently and offer a wide range of analytical capabilities......""  Can you help me?",True
