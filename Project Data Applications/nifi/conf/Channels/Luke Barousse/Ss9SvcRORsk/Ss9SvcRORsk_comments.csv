@banamailat_BM,2023-06-01T10:52:44Z,0,"When I decided to become a Data analyst 1 year ago, I met you while searching for an answer to ""where should I start?"". I'm following you for these thorough and honest reviews. And I learned a lot from you. In one of your comments, when I asked if I was too old for these jobs, you said that age is just a number. Remember? :)). Your statement was really encouraging for me. Really thanks.   Clearly; If you want to have a job, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Phyton or R, which are the entry-level tools you learn from the courses, if you do not have real-life studies in at least 3 of them, the probability of finding a job is very low. I learned this from you, and real life confirms this. No employer just looks at this certificate and asks for your bank account number. That's why, after getting the original analytical certificate, I spend my time, to sharpening my skills which I gain with course, to get specialist certificates instead of general certificates. I would be wasting my time if it weren't for those who share their honest and impartial personal experiences like you. I received my certificate in January/2023. Now I have come a long way in SQL, R (I started with the original Google analytics certificate and I love this language.) and Tableau. I am preparing for the Tableau Certification Proctored exam. You are an important figure for this community. Thanks again.",True

But, there are a ton of resources to practically learning Python.

As you mention, these certifications are good for someone who is brand new to the field and needs breadth of understanding of the field in general, hence the video heavy curriculum. I have an MBA in Business Analytics and we covered R in my program, not Python. As I have more experience in programming, I’m looking for something to get my hands dirty with, but also with thorough explanations so I can understand it better. I’ve tried DataCamp but I find that I learn less/use less critical thinking skills with the fill-in the black style code explanations.

@joeyoung7276,2023-05-11T16:32:55Z,0,"Is it possible for you to comment on ""the data janitor"" Mike West?  He makes a lot of bold claims and does seem pretty knowledgeable on the subject.  I find it hard to believe he is just wrong about everything he says but at the same time I am unsure if he is just trying to push his own data courses ( Logikbot ).  His courses focus primarily on SQL I believe which sounds great.  He says these certificates of ""completion"" are worthless to an employer and even look bad in cases.  Instead he says that you should go for a certification in the field which is very different from these online courses.  Would it be wise to just gain as much knowledge as you can from coursera, and or logikbot, and then try to take one of these certification tests at a university or wherever they offer them?  I'm not trying to bash his ideas or have you do the ladder but in my opinion he is a little on the hardcore side of the field and maybe doesn't realize that some people would be very happy with an entry level position to start , grow, learn.  I have an old bachelors  degree in C.S. and would be very happy to land anything in the data field I have been out of the loop for some time now and I would just like to know which direction to go and waste minimal time if possible.

@ShowBizJunkie,2023-05-07T20:02:17Z,3,"I am taking Google Certificate in Data Analysis right now. Befire this, I had taken SQl and Tablaeu basic. I am doing this for certificate and for discipline/order. To be good on mybown, I am having difficulty finding how to practice beginners knowledge and to gain intermediate knowledge. I was getting overwhelmed and also got me a job and became busy with it. For the whole year, I could not use my data analysis skills. So I decided to take the course. It is very basic. It wastes a lot of your time in useless exercises that dont teach you anything. Instead of making you create more small projects to learn better.  The exam questions are okay. Some of them are good, some are ridiculous but better than the opinion essays you have to write which in my opinion is waste of time",True

@Headlikeanorange84,2023-04-13T12:38:28Z,34,"Thanks for this video, Luke, and for not having it sponsored! I did the original Data Analytics course, and although it was helpful, it provided a mere taste of tools like R, SQL and Tableau. I really liked the UC Davis Tableau specialization. (The only aspect I didn't like was being dependent on the peer review pass/fail system, as a lot of people didn't take it seriously.)",True
@lotfibouhedjeur,2023-04-13T11:53:41Z,4,Thank you for calling them out on the excessive use of videos. A bunch of talking heads who sound more like motivational speakers rather than instructors. Really maxed out my boredom. 🥱,True

I honestly don't think I've learned anything of use yet. It's also ""padded-out"" with loads of videos from the Data Analytics course. Honestly, they could have made this a single course over 1 week and it would have had better value. Thumbs down so far.",True

I was going crazy about why I didn't have the audit option, but then I found out the example you use is the 'Managing Social and human capital' course,  not the data Analyst course.",True
@Flamechr,2023-04-13T04:25:14Z,3,That is why I like data camp it is much more hands on.  But I also do think that google certificate is more accepted due to the name google 😂  But I did due stanford introduction to statistic learning.   Ps they just released a new book were they use python instead of R   And stanford basic statistic.,True

@frothylube491,2023-04-13T02:01:06Z,193,"I completed the original Data Analytics certification about 3 months ago. The course is very good for beginners, however, I think Google needs to take off the aspect of “be job ready in 3-6 months” and “connect with employers.” Most of the jobs on the platform are requiring a degree and prior experience, and didn’t care about any of my work that I’d done from completing the certificate.   I wasn’t expecting to get a job because of the certificate but out of the small handful of interviews I got, which were for entry level positions, they all denied me on the basis of “lacking experience/not the right degree.” Even though one recruiter commented “that’s impressive you learned how to do this type of work within 4 months.” Truly sucks that Google isn’t trying to help more with these programs and actually help people land some jobs",True
@Geomaverick124,2023-04-13T01:54:05Z,50,"I think these courses are supposed to be taken in addition to the first course. If you take the course by itself then you will wind up missing a bunch of stuff. I would suggest to take all 3 and take the META Database Course or the SQL for Data Science and then get a tool cert like Power BI or Tableau. If short on time, take the Original Google DA certificate, META Database Engineer Certificate, and get the Tableau Data Analyst certification...you will still need to build plenty of projects. The certification will just set you a part",True
