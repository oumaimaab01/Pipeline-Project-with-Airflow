@richiehunt5097,2023-03-03T15:45:53Z,0,"Nice video.  I've been a Data Analyst for over 15 years and I'm a power user of Excel.  Over that time I continuously heard that Excel was going to become extinct and was too limited in its use.  For those looking to get into programming/analysis I would highly recommend learning Excel first because the logic translates well into other programs like SQL, Python, etc.  A lot of the language doesn't apply, but core logic is strong enough to allow those learning other platforms more familiarity so you don't get overwhelmed and lose faith in your ability to learn the new platform.  Excel is great at providing quick and simple analysis.  I'm not nutty about its visualization capabilities but if I need a quick answer to something, particularly as a quality control check, Excel is the program to use.  And from my experience, the vast majority of companies always have a need for somebody that is truly an advanced user of Excel.  I've worked with too many people that have just novice Excel skills and not only do they continually make silly errors with the program, but because they lack Excel skills projects that can take roughly a seconds to do end up taking days for them to do because they end up having to do them manually.    It's easy for analysts and programmers to trash Excel, but so many of them...including myself...owe their careers to Excel.",True

@komanguy,2022-05-23T20:37:42Z,27,"I followed a similar path. As a business analyst in a bank, my main tool to deal with huge amounts of data was excel. Processing files with almost a million rows per sheet was a daily routine. Vlookup here, sumifs there and you got your aggregations done. But it was cumbersome. Later, I wrote some vba macros in ms access to do all the dirty stuff of cleaning data, aggregating the data and exporting it into csv before doing analysis in excel. That was better but not optimal. One day, I was wondering if it was possible to overcome the 1 million rows limitation in excel, because I needed to create a new particular dashboard. I did some research and found powerpivot! Wow! That was the discovery of the century. It was so easy now to embed all the data in one file and do all the calculations there! Dax is so powerful. But again, archiving piles of data became tedious, so I learn how to use databases especially sql server. I created a data warehouse and linked all my excel to that database. Learned powerquery. The new challenge was to feed the warehouse daily: vba macros and tsql. Once you use power query and powerpivot, adopting power bi is just natural. Using excel can push you to learn lots of useful things but this app is so powerful that it‚Äôs difficult to drop it totally for other tools.",True

The main benefit to VBA is that it is built into Excel and requires no additional software dependencies.  If you plan on sending a workbook to someone with scripting in it and you don't want the user to require additional software installs, VBA is your best bet.  To be clear, it isn't the first language I'd suggest someone learn these days but to suggest that your database workbook was the fault of VBA is false.

@santiagobardelli5675,2022-05-16T19:30:54Z,0,"The video was very instructive. I tried Power query two years ago but it was not a good experience. I am sure it was because of lack of experience. It is the first time that someone mention when to use each of the tools. I mean when to use SQL, python, power query, power pivot or power BI. It would be great if you could show more exemplars on each of the steps... Thanks",True

@justinoz06,2022-05-16T13:22:17Z,0,"okay,  I am using vba to create a relational database across multiple small tables that will never exceed a few thousand rows each.  i am happy with the speed (loading the tables into arrays prior to searching) and the functionality, but am aware you need to be very careful with some of excels ""autocorrect"" functionality such as number and text to date and other helpful features. Excel is on everyone's work pc, so it can be accessed across the network, unlike access for example... though maybe you can use that to create a standalone database? anyway,  appreciate the video,  I am definitely using Excel outside the basic intent described here, with I hope appropriate caution.",True

Since I started as a Data Analyst, I've been working on the Gsheet a lot since it can directly connect to the Data Studio.
