It would factor in the times he/she would do in the meets or tests and also the heart rate after said meets or tests. Until now it sounds like a simpler project I can do with an excel spreadsheet.   My question is: Which excel for data analysis course would fit best for this type of project starting out? The Excel Basics for data analytics, or the excel skills for business specialization?  I would like to start off with the essential skills to accomplish my coach‚Äôs goal and then start diving deeper in the subjects of excel and SQL and the other programming languages.",True
