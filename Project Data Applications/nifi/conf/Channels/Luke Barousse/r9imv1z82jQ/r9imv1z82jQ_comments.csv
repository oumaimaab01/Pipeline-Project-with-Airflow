@psychxx7146,2023-07-15T12:05:57Z,1,"This is my opinion :  Bard, just like ChatGPT is yet another test platform to train the model and make it perform better over time, essentially adding on to pre training and RLHF.   While ChatGPT has been designed from the start to be versatile and universal, I view bard as a test platform that will be helpful to infuse LLMs into Google‚Äôs search engine, enhancing the user experience and preventing Microsoft and OpenAI from competing as much as they are doing right now.  TLDR ; Bard will most likely be specialised in web search and ChatGPT will stay the versatile tool it is today",True

For the sole purpose of bettering my life and learning data analytics, I've bought new laptop since the old one was very faulty and slow and I'm planning to genuinely start from zero. Yes, motivation goes away sometimes especially if you're alone or doing this at home so it will be really great if someone also wants to join me on this journey....if there's someone just starting out and also want someone to be constantly reminded of the progress...i think by sharing progress and telling each other what it needs to be done, we will progress faster than average.

Currently I'm trying to build a portfolio to showcase my skills that I am learning. However, I've run into a problem pretty early on. Here's my problem:  Context: I am attempting to do this project all within python as I am currently focusing on my python skills.  I'm a big fan of formula 1 racing. I was curious about how much qualifying lap times impact race results. So I found a website with API's I can use. I used requests library to retrieve the API's that had the data for qualifying lap times and race results for the 2021 season. They imported into my Jupyter Notebook as an xml file.   Problem: I have the pandas library installed. However, I am unsure if I am parsing the file correctly, and I'm having trouble converting the xml file into a structured, tabular, pandas DataFrame.  I hope you see this. I've scoured the internet, and even asked ChatGPT, but can't find an exact answer. It would help a lot!",True

Specifically, it wants me to clean up my line graphs and pie charts, when I have neither in the presentation.  When it tries to summarize the findings, it is able to correct identify which condition in the A/B test produced greater sales, but that was it.
