@swordsimkid23,2023-01-30T15:51:56Z,0,"I want to do that, but only with python because I don't have reliable internet enough to download things so I'm stuck with python but I love it and really want to make things out of it but the references I find require 3rd party software to make All I want for Christmas is pure python creation",True
@shivayshakti6575,2023-01-21T18:10:32Z,0,Now you can use Bigquery SQL for ML,True
@MultiCaboose,2023-01-18T03:34:48Z,0,I use Matlab. I should learn python so I can advance in Ai,True
@johanlarsson9805,2023-01-04T22:56:51Z,1,"Well, python isn't a good alternative, it just happened to become like this due to many researchers not knowing any better language and then tools were made to work with python. I blame tensorflow and numpy for this! Python is bad and slow. I built my own framework and models with c++",True
