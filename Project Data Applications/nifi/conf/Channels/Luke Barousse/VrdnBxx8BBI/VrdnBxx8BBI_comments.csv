I think they are very interesting cases how data science  is helping  local authority make strategic decisions, but I don't know yet how much I can talk about my day -to day job?

@arthurmiller5276,2021-11-13T19:55:10Z,0,"üëè This is an awesome video on the different ""Data Science"" roles. (Though I've never played Mario and got lost when it focusing on one role, showing only one title at a time, and comparing to the others. ME: ""WAIT! Was Luigi the 'engineer' or the 'analyst'?"")      I will say that, towards the end, it gets a bit discouraging. And perhaps it begins with the interviewees. Lots of vloggers and guests appear to be fresh out of college with multiple degrees, including masters, or took one sponsored advertiser's certificate course and landed six-figure FAANG jobs in a matter of weeks with little or, in the case of one, no effort to even submit a resume.      This doesn't seem realistic and gives the impression, much like many job postings, that anyone without a masters and decades of experience in technical skills like Python or PBI AND Tableau, etc is not ""qualified"" for even a basic ""Data Science"" role.      This isn't meant as a criticism, but merely ""constructive feedback"" to hopefully encourage followers to pursue a career in data science.",True
