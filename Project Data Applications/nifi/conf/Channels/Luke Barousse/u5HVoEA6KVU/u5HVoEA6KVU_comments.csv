@baptistegiannesini3139,2022-01-14T23:07:28Z,0,"hi! Happy New Year! Thank you for this awesome tutorial! I'm currently learning Tableau and your videos have been ugely helpfull! but i still have some issues with dashboard creation. Maybe can you (or some of your viewers) help me as a Tableau Power User?   I want to create a ""filter like"" menu for 5 diff√©rents sheets, if user click on the first option i want the sheet X to be visible, if user click the second option, i want to replace the sheet X by the sheet Y... I also want to create some condition on a filter ""if filter has selected a single value, show sheet Z, else show sheet W""  I think all of this can happen in Tableau, but i don't know ""how to make it happen""... Maybe a new video idea? Sorry for bad english skills and greetings from baguetteland!",True
