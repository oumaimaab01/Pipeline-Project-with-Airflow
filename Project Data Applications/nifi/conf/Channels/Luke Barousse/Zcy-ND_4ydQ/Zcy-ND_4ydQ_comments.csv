@danyos777,2022-04-15T23:46:23Z,0,"The issue at hand is that no video has segregated the use and value of using either language for a specific purpose.   Overall, while both R and Python languages achieve almost the same results, they show them using different visuals and representations depending on the purpose. Usually, they are looked at their work dealing with statical results.  R language is mostly popular among the scientific community, universities, and large and sophisticated organizations. It’s used for a lot of advanced statistical analysis that most organizations will never need to use.  Python, on the other hand, is mostly used for the analysis of the average business world from small to midsize companies, and even large.   Most data analysts get bogged down into details about tools rather than the actual use case. I feel that looking into LI job postings should be enough to tell you what path you’re following.   One must examine oneself and decide the path to follow rather than the tools. Knowing oneself and passion will help you then decide on the tools.   Am I looking for a sophisticated organization that needs more a Data Science person? This role is more sophisticated as if would go into more advanced analytics techniques and technologies.  Or, am I looking into companies that want a more entrepreneurial person with more business acumen to find business insights for a company? A data analyst role would then be more appropriate for this role as it will deal with data is spreadsheets and simple databases.  From here, we can then determine the types of tools that would be more effective and the language.  Yet, we can do more with Python if looked outside statistical needs and analytics needs. We can build things that R simply is not designed for.",True

SQL really is the foundational skill you need before Python or R. Writing proper, and specific queries will save you so much time and effort. Whether the data is local, or in a cloud based service, you need to know SQL to even interact with it. You will never analyze the data if you cant write sql to retrieve it.   That being said, I still think Python is easier for beginners vs R because the syntax is considerably easier. Python is generally written in plain english whereas R has a lot of funky syntax.  That being said, R is still very useful and certainly beats python when dealing with floating point numbers.",True
