@LukeBarousse,2024-01-27T00:15:10Z,38,"Data Nerds! Super stoked to finally have this course launched!!...again  (BTW, I have a FAQ👇)  Quick background on this course: I first launched this last November, and unfortunately, shortly after that, a plug-in that I used for the course (i.e., Noteable) was deprecated, causing me to pause enrollment for the course while I fixed it. Additionally, this entire course was behind a paywall, and I’ll be honest, I didn’t feel right keeping video content from my subscribers. So I felt like this was a sign and instead decided to make the entire course public after I upgraded the course for the deprecated plug-in issues. So, I want to thank those who support the course by buying the course notes and certificate; without y’all, future tutorials wouldn’t be possible. ✌  FAQ === Q: How do I enable 'Advanced Data Analysis', it's not in Settings under ""Beta Features""? A: 18:30 ADA is no longer included under this section and is auto included in the most advanced model.  Q: Does this require a ChatGPT subscription? A: Yes, you’ll need a Plus or Enterprise subscription to unlock the full potential of ChatGPT. The free version of ChatGPT is not powerful enough for this course.  Q: Do I need to know how to code to take this course? A: No prior coding or analytical experience is required! This is for data professionals who want to automate finding data insights.   Q: What are the computer requirements? A: You only need a functioning laptop, desktop, or tablet with an internet connection; we’ll access everything through a web browser, from ChatGPT to the course material.",True
@ak-uj2sy,2024-05-29T08:23:16Z,0,What about data safety ? Doesn't chatgpt process later on that amount of data and feed itself with it ? Nothing is for free.,True
@davidsch99,2024-05-17T19:56:45Z,1,"I took the course (which was great btw) and was very excited to create a custom GPT. I uploaded three CSV files to use as knowledge data. I provided the key column for each relationship. There are a Company file, statistical question file and a statistical answer file (with two years of data). The experience was laughable. I instructed ChatGPT to only use the data I provided and it constantly made up responses. It even made up data as it was telling me HOW it was coming up with the FAKE responses. I would ask a question like ""How many widgets did Acme Corp sell in 2023?"" It would respond like ""I see Acme Corp listed in the Company file and it is company 1234 (there was no company with that ID). I see the code for the widget question in the Stats Questions file is WDGT (that didn't exist) and the data in the Answers file linked by the question code. So Acme Corp sold 552 widgets (it made up that number)."" I must have tried 25 different ways to tell it what is was doing wrong and it would sound like it ""Got it"" but it only gave me the correct answer once. When I changed the question, it screwed up in new ways. Has anyone had this type of experience?",True

I tried and tried but chatgpt said "" Error analyzing It seems I've encountered limitations that prevent executing machine learning model training, specifically with the Random Forest Regressor, directly in this environment. This limitation is related to the operational constraints of the platform rather than an issue with the code itself. Although I'm designed to assist with generating and explaining code, including machine learning models, the execution of certain tasks, especially those requiring extensive computational resources or specific library functions like scikit-learn, might exceed the capabilities provided here. For running complex machine learning models like the Random Forest Regressor, I recommend using a local Python environment or a dedicated data science platform. These environments offer the computational resources and library support needed for such tasks, allowing you to train, test, and deploy machine learning models effectively.""

@BruceNJeffAreMyFlies,2024-01-27T11:31:15Z,0,"You say that Harvard suggests an improvement with the use of ChatGPT; is this the same study you mentioned in a previous video, that included the stipulation 'if it is within the scope' of what ChatGPT/the data nerd can do?  I just recall that it suggested that data nerds did worse if it was outside the scope and they used ChatGPT wrong - I'm wondering if there has been some improvement that means this isn't true any more?",True

@JohnPrevost424,2024-01-27T03:53:17Z,0,"Hi there! I usually lurk but I'm just getting started in the world of data analytics and had a couple of questions. As a note, I intend on watching this entire course, however, I am asking these questions beforehand so I apologize if they're covered in this -  1. As a beginner who is in Google's Data Analytics course on coursera, I am a little under halfway and it's been heavily conceptual work so far. Understanding how data analysts operate, the process and everything up to processing and cleaning data (where i'm currently at), so on and so forth. With incredible tools such as ChatGPT and other AI tidbits, I'm curious on how important is it to know the fundamentals and analytical skills? I've seen a lot of people mention to not ""overlearn"" and become an expert with SQL or R or Python, and to really put emphasis on knowing how to do what you truly need to do- but I'm curious how much in the future will be an actual data analyst and their trusty AI companion?    2. Would I be putting myself at a disadvantage if I were to lean more into being independent and not using ChatGPT (i.e. studying more and using AI less) or vice versa? I find this question incredibly challenging because I personally place a lot of emphasis on understanding what I'm doing but I don't want to be putting myself at a disadvantage because I didn't learn how to balance the mundane/autonomous parts of analysis with the human element.   3. Are there career implications if I go this path? I have a degree in Business and with a few certifications in analytics I'm hoping to start a career in Business Analysis but wonder if it'll be enough.   I hope this wasn't too sporadic! Any advice is truly appreciated and I appreciate all I've learned from this channel and community :) Thanks",True
