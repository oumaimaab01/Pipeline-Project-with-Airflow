@cucciolo182,2024-02-24T15:33:17Z,0,"Lol‚Ä¶ I thought that programmers were totally geeks and nerds, but I think you are an exception. Really nice video, and exactly, VSC is super helpful. But I hate that for now, the Copilot can‚Äôt chat with my whole code.",True

@-es2bf,2024-02-04T17:56:07Z,8,"Using ""AI"" to do something you could have done since 1985 with excel with just a few clicks on a button seems pretty useless to be brutally honest. In addition, feeding company data is a big NO if you are working in specific industries such as cyber security where publicly sharing data to the wrong people could have fatal consequences.",True
@jcoggon86,2024-02-04T17:30:46Z,6,"Thanks for confirming in the logs that GitHub Co-Pilot sometimes uses GPT 3.5 Turbo, was pulling my hair out not understanding that sometimes I would have to take my code to ChatGPT to fix the error and then continue again in Co-Pilot ü§ò",True

@qamstel,2024-02-04T08:51:26Z,4,"But if were a junior developer/data analyst, what insensitive would you see learning what all those lines of code are doing instead of relying on GPT to spit out the code for you?

,2024-02-04T08:19:28Z,0,"Could the conclusion at 1:54 not also be, that because they have access to the copilot, they have the time to go back and fix stuff, that prevously would have remained bad.",True

@jks234,2024-02-04T04:04:57Z,5,I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that this is considered making you ‚Äúlower end‚Äù in development.  And ‚Äúdoing it yourself‚Äù is considered being ‚Äúbetter at programming‚Äù.  That‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI walk to work so my commute is more legitimate than your drive.‚Äù  It‚Äôs just intentional self-sabotage in the name of outdated pride or something.  It‚Äôs like people being proud that they didn‚Äôt have to google a historical date.  How about be proud of delivering a useful product instead?,True
