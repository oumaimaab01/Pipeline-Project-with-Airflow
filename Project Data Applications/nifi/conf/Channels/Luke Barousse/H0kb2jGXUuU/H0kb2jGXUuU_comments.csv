@user-cq1wc5tz7c,2023-12-19T00:45:27Z,0,">|< I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh which are our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God's Word. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God's Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove text can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.  *HOW TO MAKE GOD'S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?* You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, ""You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men."" Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth - ""But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed"", Isaiah 53:5. Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart's desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying 'Thank you, Jesus...' over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven't let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don't worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), ""Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride..."" The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Let us watch and pray... Thank you for your time.",True

@booyalol,2023-12-08T02:10:53Z,0,"I have tried chat GPT for generating so scripts, let me tell you it S*UCKS, for the basic tasks it just does fine, but more advanced?? Well i have to ""point out where the errors are and ask it to correct it"" even after that it corrects the part where i pointed the error was, but it just vomits some parts of the earlier response which are very much required WT H!  I would rather code myself once instead of this double work😅",True
@drogonbol123,2023-12-07T23:20:17Z,0,"But, almost all the examples that google provide are not how they interact with gemini ,because they show pictures to Gemini and not video  so disappointed",True
@rudra7615,2023-12-07T20:43:17Z,0,What I fear is a race As an AI race will lead corporations forcing the release of AIs that might not be tested properly to stay ahead of the war and this is exactly how one day the AI will reply back “No…no more”.,True

@Spathever,2023-12-07T13:01:37Z,8,"It's very likely that OpenAI is a lot ahead since they completed training GPT 4 in August 2022. All that time to work on and improve a state-of-he art model is a definite advantage. But if Google has vast resources and a lot of brainpower so if Gemini proves to be a good base, they will catch-up step-by-step.",True

@FactsNoCare,2023-12-07T10:56:37Z,2,"I think it couldn't understand the graph because its only the text prompt version. In the update log it says ""you can try out Bard with Gemini Pro for text-based prompts, with support for other modalities coming soon.""",True
