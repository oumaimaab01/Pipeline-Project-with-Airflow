@mehregankbi,2021-04-28T23:04:38Z,1,"i wonder if you can find any correlations between watch data and jumping. for example a spike in heart rate correlating with jumping etc.  The labeling part is gonna be difficult tho. you'd have to start and stop recording every minute or so, so that you know when you jumped. or you could go the Michael reeves way of connecting a button to your bike so you press it while you are in the air.  Now that I'm thinking about it, a sonar/optical distance sensor attached to the bottom of the bike could do the job. welcome to data science everybody, where you can spend an eternity getting deeper and deeper into a subject :)))",True
