@Boomk27,2022-12-29T16:35:15Z,14,"After hitting my head on a desk for the last 4 months.  I’ve finally (almost) finished the infamous 100 days of Python.  It was tough, hard, challenging but I loved it. For those who wants to learn python my advice is : TAKE A F***** project hahahah.  Seriously, learn by doing is the best way. If Python doesn’t make sense at the beginning (especially if this is your first language) don’t give up, stick to it, this is the most difficult. After some time, eventually, it’ll start making sense and then let the magic operates.",True
