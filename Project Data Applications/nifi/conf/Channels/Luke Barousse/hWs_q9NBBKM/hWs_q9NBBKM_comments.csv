@logaandm,2021-03-08T21:28:43Z,2,"Windows for ARM has been available since 2012. The current version of Windows for ARM was released with the Surface Pro X in 2019. Many of your problems have nothing to do with Windows on ARM, but are a result of trying to run it on the M1 - which is an Apple and Parallels problem. So it is misleading to suggest Windows Arm is ""under development"" and misleading to people thinking that Windows support on the M1 is immanent.  I have a Surface Pro X running the pre-release developer version with x64 support and my biggest problem is the OS updates one a week. Most applications run smoothly and the only one's I've had problems with so far are those that don't have ARM drivers for the hardware. In other words, Windows ARM runs just fine.  1. Windows ARM licensing is only from the OEM (at the moment) so the only way to get a licensed version of Windows on ARM is for Apple to supply it. 2. The main problem is drivers on the hardware (Apple) or in the virtual Machine (Parallels). Microsoft has nothing to do with these drivers and does not supply or support them. 3. Under the current legal situation, you will only be able to run the (ongoing developer) pre-release version of Windows for ARM - which by definition is unstable and lacks complete support and may have features disabled. This will be the case even when Windows for ARM officially supports x64 applications.  Microsoft is committed to a fully operational ARM Version, but it has never even hinted at supporting the M1 or providing consumer licenses for ARM. Keep in mind the M1 is ARM, but it is modified by Apple and may not be compatible with what Microsoft is writing it's code for. Again, Apple or Parallels must supply the drivers for this - because Microsoft only licenses and supports large OEM ARM makers.  I think the M1 is a fantastic chip and what Apple is doing is the future direction of computing hardware, but Windows support on MacOS M1 is not by any means a certainty. If you only run MacOS applications, get the M1. If you need Windows, then I suggest keep your old hardware around for now.",True
