@ProGamer-vv7ef,2022-06-19T08:05:38Z,0,"I will share one of my interview experiences with Operative Media. The role was in UX design. I was a graduate at the time looking for 1st job and I went in with confidence on a virtual interview. They asked me about my previous experience and I showed them my personal projects including college works. Clearly, they were not impressed and asked me if I actually had any experience working on a commercial project with big teams. Since, I didnt have an industry project other than my passion, efforts and good GPA , I was straight out rejected. The manager at the time was a bit rude as well mocking the virtual interview as he expected me to show up at the office in person on my own expense from another state with no guarantee for an offer. I also didnt realize at the time but do not falsely believe there is no bias in hiring especially when all companies state that hiring is equal to all and won't be affected based on citizenship,religion,gender blah blah etc. cause I later found out that the team I was being interviewed for , the entire freakin team including the lead designer who interviewed me was from one specific race and country of origin. They did not want anyone else in the team and clearly was in violation of the law in terms of hiring practices.  So, basically the point of this was to say that even in the field of data science , I don't know how far you could go with showing personal projects and that does not mean it is not helpful but if you can get industry experience any way possible that would shut them up and most people in hiring won't pester and reject you cause they see the lack of it as inadequacy. They want some other company to take the risk of training you before they commit and this for a junior entry level role. It's sad that they do this to new graduates but very few people start out not experiencing any corporate hell including pathetic hiring practices and prejudices by the people sitting in these companies.",True

I didn't do an internship so I started off as an assistant PM. Worked my way into the position of a BI analyst. Did great in that role, moved into new position and was able to identify a big issue in my company and solved it for them. This opened me up to my current role doing doing data science thingy's for our revenue arm. If you can show that you can make money for a company, the sky is the limit.
