Pre pandemic I took a frontend web dev course and completed it, but I wasn't able to find work that was remote or outside of a big city and became really discouraged.   I saw some posts about data analysis on social media and it caught my interest. I have taken intro to databases courses with SQL years ago and was pretty good at it. My hope has been rekindled somewhat but I have concerns.  I'm not looking to work at a big name tech company or anything, I just want to work. Moving isn't something I can do right now ($$ and elderly relatives to look after). Is working remote a possibility as an entry level DA? Alternatively is freelance a source of steady work or a way to build experience if I can't find a job at a traditional company?  Also I'm over 35 and have been told how ageist tech can be, but it was mostly from coders that wanted to work their youth away at Google and the like. Is the data field that way too?

@KS-ic5tc,2022-07-04T18:33:36Z,1,"I got my Google Data Analytics Certificate in April this year. I agreed with panelists that this certificate is a great starting point if you want to pursue a career in data analytics, but unlike panelists here, it took me about 8 months to finish the program because I was taking other courses on Coursera. I have taken Python for Everyone, SQL for Data Science, Tableau Visualization, and Wharton Business Analytics while finishing up this certificate.  I was a Marketing Associate and have been wanting to switch my career to Data Analytics. I started looking for a new job in data analytics in May after getting my certificate. I applied for 80 jobs over 5 weeks, got 27 rejections, interviews from 6 companies, and just landed my first job as a data analyst that I truly love.  In my personal experience, this certificate is very helpful in three ways: First, it teaches you how to approach a data analytics project in general (6 steps in this program). This comes in handy very much during the interview process because you will get asked questions like that by interviewers. Whenever I was asked this question during the interview, I felt very confident in answering.  Second, the Capstone Project can give you things to talk about during the interview when you are asked a question about the data analysis project you have done. So I would DEFINITELY recommend finishing the capstone project.  Third, upon getting this certificate, you will get one-year free access to Google's Big Interview, which I found extremely helpful in writing the resume and preparing for the interviews.  However, getting this certificate itself is not enough to get you a job. You will need to do a lot more than just this certificate such as doing more data analytics projects, getting more certificates like Python for Everyone, SQL for Data Science, etc.  I hope sharing my experience can help other people with their data analytics journey. I would love to share more if you have a sequel to this video :)  Really love all the videos and keep up the good work, Luke!!",True

Its not just about getting a job, the stuff you learn from these high quality courses (there are more so check them out too) will help you figure things out. IT is very overwhelming if you are passionate about working on a meaningful project, and even getting to know how basic things work is pretty euphoric. You won't get a job just by doing these, but these are helpful. I got a paid internship (Students in India usually do not get paid internships unless they are from the IITs, its really messed up, and only few students get internships in their 1st year) and the questions asked to me during my interview process were mostly based on my projects, and i could answer them so well only because i knew exactly what i was doing, and these courses played a huge part in this. 100/10 absolutely recommended.

@adamquek1095,2022-04-08T12:26:35Z,2,"Thanks for diving into this topic. I have completed the Google Data Analytics certificate last year just for fun, and also to see what the hype was about. I have more than 12 years of data analysis experience, and the course took me around a month to complete. Just to be clear, it was not meant to help me clinch my current job (dealing with machine learning). It's just something I'm curious about.   I do echo with the others that this is a good introduction to someone who have no previous experience in data analysis before. It is however not really set up to help clinch a data analyst job. Realistically, someone in the industry needs to be fluent in at least one programming language, and that do take a lot of time and dedication, beyond what this certificate cover. What this certification introduced in SQL and R are insufficient to carry out the daily data wrangling work that are often noisy, and the requirements of the analysis (mining and evaluation) can be ill-defined.

@ModestMatcha,2022-04-06T18:18:39Z,2,I think the problem is that a lot of people who go for this certificate is that some people get this certificate and don‚Äôt have a degree in anything. The people who get a job with the certificate usually have degrees. Someone without a degree it‚Äôs almost impossible to hear a call back.

@jb-oi9yv,2022-04-03T16:15:42Z,2,"By the way it is not a big deal breaker that they teach R instead of python. You can literally watch 1-2 YouTube videos of python and be as ready as the people learning R from this certificate. The programming in this certificate is nothing complicated just the basics you need for data analytics. Theres no crazy algorithms you need to learn just basic R so if you want Python instead, then I recommend you to watch 1-2 YouTube videos of python related to data. One big thing I recommend people is to really master at least excel. Theres so much you can do with excel. There are some analyst jobs that all they do is excel. If you can master one I would go for excel. Then I would go for SQL. Like I said you only need to know the basics of Python or R for data analytics so you don't need to master programming as long as you know enough to apply it to your data.",True

What would be the demand of Data Science in next 5 to 10 or 15 years? Whether it will going to grow or decline in future? How would it help in boosting the economy of the countries? There are some rumours that it will going to get automated. But I believe that if such type of job will get automated then there will not be any job left for humans in the world.

@Voyager_AU,2022-04-01T15:51:59Z,2,"I am using Google's cerfificate as a framework on what I should learn. Becase of that, it is taking me about 5-6 months to finish it.   For example, I would do a weeks work of lessons from the cert in one day, but then focus the next several weeks taking additional courses and even a book or two focusing just on Excel and Power Query. Rinse and repeat for SQL and now I am on Power BI.  While the cert taught Tableau, instead of Power BI, I have been studying so much Excel/Power Query that Power BI felt like a natural extension. Ironically, since studying Power BI, I have come full circle and am diving more into Power Query and now DAX.  When the R course came up, I had to make a choice. Should I study R, Python or focus on portfolio projects right now? I decided to focus on portfolio projects because what I learned in Excel, SQL and Power BI will be a good enough foundation to start applying in projects. I can learn R or Python later.  So, I am running through the R course in one week get it out of the way. (I am thankful to have at least an introduction in R). On the side I am taking some Power BI and DAX courses and I just finished reading ""Master Your Data with Power Query in Excel and Power BI"" by Ken Puls and Miguel Escobar. (I highly recommend this book)  I have done a few projects throughout some courses but once I finished the courses I am doing right now, I will start grabbing some datasets and focus on doing my own projects to apply what I have learned.  In summary, the google's cert skims the surface. There is no way you can learn to be a data analysis with JUST the certificate. However, it does provide a good framework for further study.

I am just now feeling like I can make it into the field with my newfound knowledge. I guess I am pretty risk-averse to trying to learn everything I can until I am comfortable applying. I'll get there though. My background is 5 years in the manufacturing field with a mechanical engineering degree as well.",True

@anantsinha3067,2022-04-01T14:57:11Z,22,"As always what an amazingly made video!!  What surprised me the most was even though none of us have had conversations in real life, our thought process and approach to everything related to learning and job search are so so similar!  Really loved the way you took our almost hour long conversation and condensed it in a way that I felt our whole conversation was in this video.   And finally congratulations my fellow interviewees for getting such amazing jobs!!",True
@MessinaImages,2022-04-01T14:40:35Z,5,"Thank you so much for this video and all your very helpful research. In the interviews, they mentioned the Google Certificate Data Analytics course is a great place to start. What are great next steps for people after they finish the course? Additional courses that cover SQL/R/Python/Tableau?",True

@o0laieta0o,2022-04-01T14:02:04Z,0,Luke can you talk with people that did the HarvardX one? It's 800$ so it's a bit pricey but it's for data scientist instead of analyst.,True
@o0laieta0o,2022-04-01T13:48:52Z,33,I'm taking it right now! It's pretty interesting so far. I'm also taking the ML one from Stanford. Hopefully it will allow me to find a good wfh data analyst/scientist job.,True

At first I thought I was doing unnecessary studying on the side, but I am just adding on to the knowledge that I know now. I'm willing to learn it all just to get my foot in the door. Thank you!",True

@syhusada1130,2022-04-01T13:35:18Z,0,"As a GDAC alumnus, I have yet to get a job from it :(  ... because I'm still shackled by my current job.   Too bad I hate my job, so I don't really want to mix the data stuff with my government job which is pretty hard to resign from, with convoluted bureaucratic rules and steps and wastes of times.   But I might mix my hobbies into the data stuff, I doubt I can get a job with it though.  Also, I've been learning Python. And I like that how easy it is to chain function just with xxx().xxx().xxx().  I want to combine R and Python in 1 project, do you know what project that might present that? In Kaggle, unfortunately, I can only use R and Python in different notebook.",True

@cesararacena,2022-04-01T12:36:49Z,6,"Hey Luke. I've got my Google DA certificate a couple weeks ago and I just want to make a point on the R vs. Python discussion. They both can do the same when it comes down to manage data. The main difference is how you have to write each of them. If you have never ever learned any programming language before, Python is intuitive to learn. This is equal to this. Do the following and a colon at the end while R is not like that. You assign with an arrow to either left or right, you have to put variables the other way around sometimes... it's a mess.  Now, if you come from a different language, you feel like you are learning to program all over again. You have to switch a lot of switches in your brain and that can really hurt your programming skills in the long run.  To put it more clearly, if you know all other modern programming languages in the world, you will find R very weird so no matter how good is it for data analysis, nobody should be using it for that. It hurts people. R is bad for humanity. Leave it just for weird people like statisticians.",True

@Z3R090210,2022-04-01T11:31:01Z,104,One of the things I don't hear a lot when talking about the Google Data Analytics Certificate is how the Certificate occasionally reminds you that it's preparing you for a Junior Data Analyst role.  So I'd be interested to see if the experiences differ for applicants if they're applying for a Junior Position.,True
@hrinaldy,2022-04-01T11:30:57Z,0,"Hi Luke, I actually enrolled this Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate by February because watching some of your videos (especially about this program), and now I'm on the end of the fifth course (3 courses more to go), I think what's next is enroll the same program but by IBM or taking python for data analytics, which one should be?",True
