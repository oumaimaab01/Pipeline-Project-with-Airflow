Started with Google DA cert, then moved on to UC-Davis SQL Training, then the UC-Davis Tableau specialization. Already had previous working knowledge of Excel. I was able to use these courses to increase my pay by over 50% by quitting teaching and becoming a data analyst. Thank you for the recommendations on what are the best Python courses though, that is my next target. Suppose I can benefit from the Excel course too. Thank you for sharing these.

He was making 48K with no prior experience and no degree; only having a certificate from the General Assembly bootcamp. Now, in his current position, of just one year, he is making more than 75K in Chicago! He loves his job and works remotely, 90% of the time. He learned CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, React, MongoDB, Express, Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Fullstack applications. He believes I have the aptitude for this field.  However, I know he's tech savvy and me, not so much...he's 41 and I am 52. We both have had major struggles in life trying to find out what we want to do in our careers. We both have had jobs in car sales/finance, dance and health industries and various odd jobs. I recently became a Flight Attendant, love the free flying benefits but hate having to be away from home so much...I'm so torn.

@noor_51,2023-01-25T09:51:01Z,0,"Incredible stuff here Sir. I would encourage anyone watching to follow these tips in becoming a Data Analyst. Just ensure that you get some credible certifications to prove your competence. This will make it very easy to get recognized among the crowd. There are tons of them, some are even free like the Alteryx certification. I can help guide anyone to pass the Alteryx exams. I am already certified. Before all these, I graduated with my first degree in Mathematics. However, it was very tough finding a job with that degree. I then started learning Data Analytics on YouTube and acquired intermediate competence in using various software like Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Despite having these skills, it was still very challenging to land my first job because I didn't have the credentials to justify my skills. So I resorted to online freelancing while building my professional network. It was then that an idea struck me to seek certification that could enable me prove my competence in the said areas. However, another major obstacle was that majority of the certifications like Tableau, Power Bi, and Oracle were a bit expensive for me since I didn't have a job yet. So I learnt of Alteryx free certification and aced it https://www.dropbox.com/s/9imtpea345s166h/Alteryx%20Cert.jpg?dl=0. It became a good starting point for me and later on I was able to raise funds and register for the paid certifications. I am glad and appreciative for the progress I have made ever since.",True

@joaovitorpinheiroocker8343,2021-12-27T18:27:00Z,1,"Great tips Luke! I have to say that from your list I have completed 2 specializations (Excel e Python) already, and in the way to finishing the 3 one (Tableau). What are your thoughts about learning tools for unstructured data, like MongoDB, and for work with peers, like Git, it should come right after getting some knowledge in script languages?  As always, awesome content!",True

@thecrippler555,2021-12-27T17:02:31Z,17,"Hey Luke, currently I'm going through the Goodle Data Analytics certification. However, I have a question, do you have any recommendation for courses that teach soft skills for data analysis instead of just technical skills?",True

@tonepoet,2021-12-27T15:17:42Z,0,"Timely, man, just finished course 2 of Google Data Analytics from Coursera and got the certificate (10 minutes ago!). Invaluable info, Luke. Going to comb through your links and get my hands dirty with more knowledge.   Question, man, would you suggest learning something in parallel to finishing up the rest of the Google Data Analytics course, or should I focus solely on that? I also have access to LinkedIn Learning, which is loaded with courses.",True
@ikeslo,2021-12-27T14:43:31Z,21,"Awesome video, luke. Yes, I find the Coursera platform is the best to learn too. I'll add a few of them to my saved list to enroll later to continue my Data Science track. I finished the Python for Everybody Specialization already. Now I'm doing another python course to solidify my python skills because I need to take a Machine Learning specialization. I'm almost done with PostgreSQL Specialization. I'll check the Exel and Tableau next. I'm planning to enroll in a Master's Degree Program in Data Science later on, but I need an entry-level Data Science job first to cover the cost.",True
@GalaxyTracker,2021-12-27T14:31:41Z,0,"Hi Luke. I am a recent subscriber. I would like to ask your opinion on some path choices. My field is environmental engineering and I am interested in learning data analysis in order to build my CV,  maybe land a job in research and get accepted into a Masters for uni. I need data analysis for working with large data structures for projects and studies. I realized, writing my thesis, that, if I knew Python, I would easily be able to work with my dataset, and would save weeks off my project. So, now, I started with ""Python for Everybody"" in Coursera, which teaches you Python to work with data structures, etc. I plan to go for the Google certificate after this. My plan is to finish them both in the next 9 months. In short, I don't need the data analysis certificate as a main requirement for the job, but more as a means to have more skills in search for a job in research fields and for an application for a Masters. I have some programming background, so, they seem easy, so far. Have you got any other recommendations? Thank you in advance and keep up the good work!",True

@danielbruck3103,2021-12-27T11:43:50Z,5,I’m a bit confused by the one thing in the video. Are you saying that the pass you recommend is to finish the google certification and after it a number of the mentioned courses? Or is it one or the other as doing the all would be at least 4-500 hours  I know that in other videos about the google certificate you said that it wouldn’t be enough in it self and some other things on ones cv can go a long way  Basically I’m a bit confused on how in-depths you need to know a specific skill to reasonably get a job in data science/analytics   Thanks for the videos you help a lot for many people so keep up the good work :),True
