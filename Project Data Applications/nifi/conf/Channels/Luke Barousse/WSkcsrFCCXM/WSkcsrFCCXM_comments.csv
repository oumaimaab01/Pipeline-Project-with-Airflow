Because the AI responds you with extreme confidence and sometimes the responses are wrong, because it skips part of the logic or the data. It is great for a preliminar view or to accelerate insights, but in a serious job it has to be double checked. Another thing, that you even mention in your video, is the high concern about data privacy.   If I may ask you something.  There are a lot of companies asking for deep knowledge in ETL processes and Data Warehousing. I have seen many offers asking for snowflake, AWS, BigQuery, Spark, knowledges of Data Lakes, etc.   I completed many of the courses that you've recommended for the basic tools (SQL, Tableau, Excel, the Data Analytics from Google) and they were all very good.

I am doing a course where they help you to upskill yourself even if you're not from a tech background. I am very positive about AI and data science going hand in hand. I did a real world analysis of the students in my batch (we have a mixed batch, consists of people already working in the data field and people who are freshers in data), I found that the freshers are more inclined towards using AI tools to perform day to day tasks and even learning new concepts. The people who are already into data, have heard about AI tools but the new people entering into data are actually using AI tools to get their work done. Even for me, I use chatgpt to debug any python code for me and to find alternate ways to solve a problem as it reduces dependency on others for easy problems.

@diegoariel707,2023-07-08T12:59:05Z,0,"Very interesting, I think that the economy situation we are living in has to do with the companies response towards AI. Maybe this will dramatically chague in the near future.",True
@user-wp8vj2bt7y,2023-07-08T12:32:04Z,0,I love the idea of a green screen special this moment 3:47 made me laugh 😅,True
@screenapple1660,2023-07-08T12:14:15Z,0,has anyone tries something different. What if you take entire Chatgpt information and turn into Chip implant and insert into dog's brain. Can dogs actually talk like human or Brian from Family guy? Just curious....,True
@Thuvu5,2023-07-08T10:05:30Z,1,"I totally relate to the moment when you got some graphs out and think ""Hm.. I don't like this!"" 🤣Love this video and the analyses! 💖 The Noteable plugin seems pretty solid! We're definitely facing a big time as data professionals RN",True
@nick_g,2023-07-08T08:31:56Z,0,I mean… the title for the video might perform better if it’s “How I use ChatGPT… as a millionaire” 😂,True
@KenJee_ds,2023-07-08T08:00:43Z,2,Elite clothing choice at 1:18. Also loved the new green screen Luke in my Chat GPT window. How can I get that feature?,True

@justStardust940,2023-07-08T05:40:44Z,0,this means AI can replace data analysts sooner than we thought?,True
@praveenkumar_0143,2023-07-08T05:08:38Z,0,"Hello Luke, what is your opinion on using AI in Data science jobs from business perspective and most analysis has to be done based on historical data of customers or any companies data then there is a chance that data we are feeding to AI can be risky. While using chatgpt, what are do's and don'ts especially people working in companies.",True
@jordanmartinetti8224,2023-07-08T04:28:49Z,1,4 out of 5 is an A+? Confirmed Luke plays JRPGs and knows S tier is the highest.   One of the frustrating things I hear about are those companies that have blocked these AI tools from being used because they deal with sensitive data and employees can’t be trusted to use it properly.,True
@mohamedfakhri2390,2023-07-08T03:07:10Z,0,can i become data analyst by using phone or even learn by mobile,True

@1sttimegunowner,2023-07-07T22:18:58Z,0,This is cool as an analyst I think itll be a requirement to know how to use these tools,True
@jimmycabutotan975,2023-07-07T21:57:36Z,1,"I really like how you choose your application as data analysts, thanks for data set although it's not conclusive somehow it give me a picture of what's its gonna be a year from now. I'm really worried about how Ai will affect this job in the future and it gives me somehow a better perspective.",True
@nwba,2023-07-07T21:56:44Z,0,What about data security of connecting your database to this thing? Is it safe to connect work or even HIPPA data to this?,True
@Prawnz-cl9sv,2023-07-07T21:31:56Z,0,"Love the topic & Content! Keep sharing the good work (pls no ads! take sponsors instead), you can cross 1M by end of this year",True
@paulbuono5088,2023-07-07T21:31:44Z,197,"I'm a teacher learning data analysis/data scientist and one thing I found working with ChatGPT that reminds me of teaching is that with a class of students, you can't just give instructions to a class activity and then sit back and wait for them to finish. You have to make sure everyone understood but observing their work/progress. And that's a lot like ChatGPT, you can't just ask it to do something and then blindly assume what it gives you is correct. You still need to check what it produces to make sure the two of you are on the same page.",True
@marcink6879,2023-07-07T21:29:49Z,8,"As long as AI tools are not implemented in companies, these will not require employees to have that skill. It all boils down to privacy issues, as you mentioned. That will take some time. If I were to guess, that's a frame of 1-2 years, depending on the law, which is being established right now (in Europe at least). edit: that applies to big companies, smaller ones might get into that earlier.",True
@shinlanten,2023-07-07T21:18:33Z,3,"*_""If it ain't broke don't broke, don't fix it""_*  That's the mentality of the companies I worked for so it's not surprising that the survey showed few companies requiring AI related knowledge.",True

@afrasineiserban8298,2023-07-07T20:51:44Z,9,"Very thorough video as always! Also the thing about why it gives different values compared to what you see in the pdf itself, from what i read about how generative ai and tools like chatgpt work is they try to *guess* what the true response *should* be, that’s why in this context they’re not very good at working with numbers. For example if you give it a simple multiplication of two numbers it gives something that *looks* right even though it isn’t most of the time.",True
@Mandelbrot567,2023-07-07T20:46:20Z,0,"Some very interesting analysis and conclusions, appreciate the video, thanks.",True
