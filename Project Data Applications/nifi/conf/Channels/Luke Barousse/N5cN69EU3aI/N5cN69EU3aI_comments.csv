@carlkim2577,2023-11-25T01:46:13Z,0,I'm curious how their Advanced Data Analysis scales up. We have multiple gigs data sets. I have a feeling it will have issues reading it all unless some sort of RAG is implemented.  Maybe they already have?,True

@SalientInsights,2023-09-18T02:26:40Z,1,"This will be interesting to see how Data Governance Councils of various organizations will handle outputs for this, should they adopt the Enterprise editions.

@madjohnshaft,2023-09-17T18:02:10Z,0,"Thank you for this. I was baffled by the discontinuities between their press and what I was using it for - doing the case studies from my MIT No Code MLAI class.   It's not there yet, but once it gets the libraries it is always failing to load and the memory it does not have access to, it might be something outstanding.   The EDA great, plan of attack for models is great, but always dies in the random forest.   Try making Word Clouds!   It is an expert at RapidMiner and you can cut and paste the operators in all at once and it will give a nice analysis of the XML too.",True
