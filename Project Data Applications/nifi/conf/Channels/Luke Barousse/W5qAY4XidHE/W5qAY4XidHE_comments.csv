@dwaynesudduth1028,2022-07-22T11:19:36Z,0,"I suspect that the negative comments about interspersing activity with your workday were by mostly Americans.   Here, we even have companies installing spyware that records keystroke frequency or they enforce rules that your camera must be on, and if you look away too long, you're penalized---all to ensure their concept of 'Productivity' for their remote/telework personnel. (luckily, my company is not one of those).  Work studies show that very few workers are 100% engaged and focused while at work. The best is about 80% and I think it averages somewhere in the 65%-70% range.    I would argue that, if you're thinking about a work problem when you're not at your keyboard, you're still being productive--so if you're engaged in your brain on a walk, bike ride, run, etc. on work---you're really working.    I actually watched this for my daughter who is struggling a bit for her elementary education degree and have passed it (and the Coursera offering you mentioned) to her.

@SuperUdhai,2022-05-15T06:02:03Z,0,"Now here is a ridiculously powerful technique for long term learning.  Just before sleeping every night, close your eyes and start recalling what you have learned during the day. Make sure your body is completely relaxed and you dont need to open your eyes after this exercise and will go to sleep from this point onwards. Back to recall: Start recalling in detail what you have learnt throughout the day. Go in as much detail as possible. If you are unable to recall, that is also an indicator of somewhat ineffective techniques used during the day.  Its important when your doing this exercise you go in as much detail as possible. Infact, try to go in every minute detail you can come up with, even if its indirectly related to learning like what music you were listening, what you were wearing or what you could see through the window outside.   This recall exercise, significantly increases the connection of new synaptic connections throughout the night. Not only that, the next day, before starting work, just take five minutes to recall what you learnt yesterday. You would notice an incredible change in your recalling capacity.   It did wonders for me. Hope it does the same for you guys!!",True

I then take a picture/scan in my notes and use an OCR to convert my notes. I save the digital image and OCR text to a digital notebook by date and can then search notes.

Regarding the negative comments on your workday routine, I don't understand why the incorporation of healthy things like exercise and leisure activities into your workday is seen negatively. Yes, work is important, having an income is important, but, it's more important to stay sane and healthy, and it's things like exercise and leisure activities that help a lot of us in doing that.   Regardless mate, love the videos, looking forward to the next one!",True

@konstantinosmaravegias4198,2022-02-25T21:33:26Z,5,"Thanks for the video Luke. Amazing work.  While I was studying my MSc in Data Science, almost every night prior sleep I would study a few pages of Data Analysis/Data science books.  This definitely helped me to know where to recall the information i need to solve a specific problem. I remember reading the ""Python for Data analysis"", and even if i was already quite confident with python i was often surprised with some very handy but ""not so popular"" functions. By this way next time i was working on a problem i had an extra tool (function) in my disposal. Code has many similarities with a tool box. What you need to know is what tools are available and which are the most suitable for the particular problem you are currently facing. You can  always recall how to use this particular function/library as long as you know its existence.",True

I've recently learned more about her background and her approach, it's just awesome.  I have recommended this course to so many people, it's awesome to see you do a piece on it.  And I recently listened to the book 'Ultra learning' by Scott Young, which I found a nice revisit of some stuff I'd come across before, with some interesting new info too.    I'm surprised there was such push back on you including activities throughout your day, I have the sense that people might not understand enough about burnout or diminishing returns.  But also, why are we working?  Surely being able to include activities we enjoy in our days, which also reinforces our ability to do great work and learn is a good thing?!    More great content!

In college, I read thru my notes and repeat them in my head as you would in a rehearsal. I try not to memorize rather understand it based on my notes and repeat them without looking in my own words. Now I know I am not the only one. hahahahahaha! Thanks, Luke! this affirms my old method is right. And I agree, employers do not have the luxury of time to wait for you to recall or read your notes again. that is my struggle at the moment.
