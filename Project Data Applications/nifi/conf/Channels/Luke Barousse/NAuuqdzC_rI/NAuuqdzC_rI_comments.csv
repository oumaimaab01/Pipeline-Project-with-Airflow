@TheKittenLover69,2022-03-22T00:20:21Z,0,"Hi Luke,  I am struggling to determine a future career. I am wondering if you could give me your thoughts on a potential path I might like to go down.  Currently, I am working as a lab technician in a biochemistry lab, studying yeast genetics and translational machinery. However, I have always wanted to work with neuroscience and study emotion, cognition and memory.   In addition, I have always loved math and wanted to become an engineer but in my undergraduate schooling I decided to go with a biochemistry degree to try and pursue a medical doctorate. Unfortunately, my ambition and drive to continue into medical school fizzled away and I never took the mCAT.  So, I am currently thinking of trying to use data science or data analytics inside of a medical institution to try and explore, refine and develop neurological disease therapies or use data science or analytics to engineer therapies or technology to aid in neurological disorders.

As far as stakeholders having strong opinions on which charts you should use (looking at you finance people üòÖ), I generally create the exact dashboard the stakeholder asks for and then add my ideas. When I present the dashboard, I start off with what they asked for, make they‚Äôre they‚Äôre satisfied with that, then say something like ‚ÄúI put something together last night that I think might help‚Äù and show them the extras.

Soon you will be making spreadsheets and trying to quantify everything. While thinking like that has its benefits, there are many downsides.",True

Each person can modify the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or workbook. Eventually, nobody can agree on the outcomes produced by the various modified versions , each held by a single individual. An interactive dashboard, with clearly defined functionality and restricted ways to ""tamper with the outcome,"" in my opinion, is a superior way to let users ""play"" with the data.",True
