Now I'm looking for a job or internship as I have no work experience.   I studied SQL in the year and looked into Power BI from Youtube tutorials;  Recently started looking into Python on Kaggle  The problem I have is all the SQL work I did was contained.  Trying to find an internship to get that experience but I'm struggling. I have ADHD and have trouble learning things, retaining the information.  Could you suggest an idea for me to progress?  I really want to break into the market badly and start getting actual experience... It's upsetting that I can't find anything.  I'm from South Africa and they always ask for 3-5yr experience.  Pls Luke, help me",True

@michaelprinc,2023-08-22T16:09:13Z,3,Thank you for an interesting video. I see there are notable synergies with ChatGPT and other external tools. I presume that Code Interpreter is better for a complete data analysis of a smaller data set when you do not care for version control. While Noteable plug-in is better for larger data sets and more precise version control and its other capabilities are somewhat limited.,True
