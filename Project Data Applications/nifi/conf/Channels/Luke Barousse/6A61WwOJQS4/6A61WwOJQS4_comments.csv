@Mr.Potato23,2023-04-02T04:51:01Z,0,Why PowerBI is below Tableau and Python here ? I thought most companies prefer PowerBI over Tableau.,True
@whitewolf9660,2023-03-27T15:54:08Z,0,"There's a massive disproportion between the experience expected/ what you can do and what companies will pay you.  I have experience in research and science for a decade, but did not have a ""technical title"" for X+ years as many job positions ask. I knew all the basics and intermediate knowledge of SQL/computer science and even more for Excel/statistics.   I'm paid ~$50k less than a ""lead automation technology analyst"" who cannot do half of what I can do, but she has had that ""technology analyst"" title for 5 years.  Personally, I think HR departments along with managers and what people can actually do are hugely out of touch.. even gatekeeping.. access to these titles.  I have a manager who was a software engineer and I can just about keep up with him in every domain of a data analyst position, and arguably know more about statistics and research modeling.  It's wild how people seem to neglect or don't acknowledge that you're not just competing against other people in the job market - you're competing against a club, egos, and ignorance that doesn't really want to have people come into the field.  At least that's been my experience with corporate and I may well be too bias.",True
