At leas 32 gigs of RAM is highly recommended in those cases. Mac is an interesting beast here. Overpriced for most use-cases. BUT, if you're crunching MASSIVE ML models or similar, a highly spec'd M2 MAX with 64 or 96 GB of RAM becomes useful, as models might require more GPU memory, and 8 or even 12 GB of VRAM might be insufficient, and the runs would fail. GPUs with more RAM than that will cost more than a MacBook 16"" with M2 Max and 64/96 GB of RAM. And M2 can put all the ram to use for GPU tasks.

Example.: The fact that I can run Diablo 1 or even Doom from 95 on a PC with brand new hardware with very few to no problems says a lot. The fact that I can run XP, Vista, 7, and 8 on new hardware also says a lot. That fact that Windows takes time to end support also says a lot.

No you have until 2025 and even then you will have major companies that have there own fire walls and so on in which they won't even upgrade to Winndows 11.
