There's something I simply don't understand: let's say you build a project, run the analysis and jump into an outcome. Fine. Project finished. What's next? Even if you build a dashboard, it becomes ""their"" problem because you aim them to self manage their decision making process. Is this right? If so, what is the daily basis activity of a data scientist? Would I be unemployed right after the project is finished? I'm kind of stuck with this doubt. Thabks for your great videos.

@md.masumomarjashim,2022-03-07T16:28:12Z,1,"This was eye opening. Just listening works. But I am usually alone at work. And would like some ideas for solo projects for a newbie to programming to go into my portfolio. I don't have a portfolio website for myself, but would like to add the experience on LinkedIn or the likes. I just cannot start working on Upwork because of the shifts I mentioned in your previous video. So I would like to get a little bit of experience in analysis and programming (I am learning R due to the Google Data Analytics Certificate) so I need lots of time for the projects. Are there any DIY Data projects for newbies like me? I searched Google but the projects mentioned there are either too difficult as I am new to programming or are very time consuming.  I was thinking maybe I should just ask my boss to give me sales data from his business and then talk with you on how to approach the analysis, if he even agrees to provide the data to me. Other than that, I just can't seem to get working on my portfolio. My Google Certification Capstone took me almost 2 months to complete due to time limitations.   I am sorry for my really long comments, I wish I could TL;DR them, but the TL;DR would remove the details that would make a person comprehend my situation on a fundamental level. This is Saudi Arabia. There is no team here. Expats just are thrown into a job and expected to do everything. My boss comes around at 11 usually. And we also have to do his job on the maintenance part. Basically, I do the job of my immediate Supervisor and he handles everything for the boss. And being Saudi Arabia, we cannot even raise our voice, because there is no rights here for expats, like literally. I hope you have a clearer picture of my situation. I have my family to take care of. And little to no savings. If I had savings, I wouldn't have stayed here. Most of my earnings go to my family to support them with the help of my sisters living in the US because I earn very less. They are trying to get me to the US but I cannot get a work visa if I have no experience and maintenance planner experience in Gulf nations are not appreciated there is no exposure to technical work in Gulf countries.",True
