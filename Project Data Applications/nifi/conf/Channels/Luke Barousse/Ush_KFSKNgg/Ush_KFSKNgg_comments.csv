@Davlet,2023-01-06T20:45:22Z,0,"I don't know why you all recommend Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This course is AWFUL in terms of structure and tools. A total waste of time. They explain many things over and over again. You can spend one hour on a topic that can be described in 15 min. The instructors don't instruct you, they just read some text from prompter. Practical activities is not what this course is about. I really mean it: this course is disaster. Go read reviews from actual users. Most liked ones are 1 star reviews. One good blogger like you could teach better than this course.",True

@HeinsChristian,2022-02-16T06:33:25Z,0,"Hello Luke, Thank you for your informative and humorous information. I am 41 years old and come from Germany. Two years ago I completed my Masters in Finance and Accounting. Now I work in a bank in customer potential management (i.e. not really ""finance and accounting"") as a data analyst. I am currently completing the IBM Data Analyst course and am definitely planning the Google Data Analyst course afterwards. Now I saw the Master of Science in Data Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. This costs about 20 kUSD. However, the individual modules can be visited individually (about 80 dollars a month for 70 euros). With a required period of 2 years, this costs about 2 kUSD. I don't think I need another academic degree. Long story short: Maybe you can say something about the possibility of attending these master's degrees as a course. I can imagine that these are to be placed well above the certificates in terms of the range of services. Is the scope actually identical to the respective master's degrees?",True
