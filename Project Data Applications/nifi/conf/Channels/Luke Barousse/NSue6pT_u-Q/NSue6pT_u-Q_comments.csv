@ajaypatro1554,2023-10-30T12:13:31Z,0,"Hy, luke, Myself Ajay I've been meaning to reach out to you for quite some time now, I wanted to know opinion on my roadmap for Data Science for Geospatial Industry, I will not waste your time I will share what I am doing write now and what are my goals are and please give me idea what to do:  I have a postgraduate degree in geoinformatics, but I've had trouble finding a suitable job in the field of spatial analysis. This is mainly because I lacked Python skills. However, as soon as I started the CS50 Python course, I realized there's a whole world of spatial analytics out there (which is essentially like supercharged spatial analysis with data science). I'm currently enrolled in CS50 Python and plan to take CS50 SQL next. After that, I wanted to know if Google's Advanced Data Analytics course is a good choice for someone like me who doesn't have a fundamental understanding of data science and statistics. I'm also interested in statistical learning, but I'm not sure how to go about it since it's currently in R on edX. I did find a book in Python for it, though.  I also have an interest in computer vision applications in the field of earth observation and machine learning for spatial data patterns. Essentially, I want to do what Foursquare and CartoDB are doing in spatial data science, with a focus on image processing for earth observation (although this part can wait for about a year).  or should i go for IBM's Data Science certificate",True

Super niche use case, but it would be great to see. (I need to put a spreadsheet on computers that don't have Excel on them, and my options are image file on desktop the user can double click on, or wallpaper, and I like wallpaper a whole lot better, since it's harder to get rid of .)

Together, these are the single biggest upgrade to Microsoft Office since its very introduction 25 years or so ago. Yes, it will change work. Yet at the same time fears that lots of jobs will disappear are likely overblown. We can't turn back the clock, and time doesn't stand still either. Business is competitive and so is work to some extent. Level up, figure out how it works and reap the benefits. Most of the new features will result in increased productivity by reducing the amount of donkey work. The resulting productivity improvements are the single most important long(er) term driver for healthy economic growth and prosperity for all of us, provided we're willing to change and level up.",True
