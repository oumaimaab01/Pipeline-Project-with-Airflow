The best thing to do is teach some basic sql and add it in as a plugin to the spreadsheet program.   The biggest difference between an enduser and a software developer is that the enduser expects their program to work even if they put in ambigious data. A developer knows that exactness is required.   Once I got my friend trained on the concept of yes the program will react differently if you put an uppercase vs a lowercase letter as a filename and special symbols may or may not affect the output, they were able to troubleshoot their own issues.

@eltreum1,2021-07-02T21:53:41Z,0,Good case example. We use Tableau to mine our various data lakes for analytics and is mostly for the non technical people/managers. We started to use MSs BI solution but that is more the technical side of the house that uses it more for machine learning and custom mining data for patterns that indicate unknown opportunities for sales or network operations trends/audits that cause system outages in the future.  Python is a great companion for Excel as well as data on a SQL database as that server can run python on it instead of the end users machine and just send them results in a browser or Tableau plugin. R is getting traction in data science because its faster in the runtime but is still going through growing pains where Python is very well known and proven. Both are great for this type of work though. It's all about using the right tool for the right job.  SQL is great for tabular data but has its own limitations. If your data is multiple tables of related/join data and needs to find various relationship based insights that change it has the same problem as Excel. The larger and more numerous the data tables are it gets slower to search. The queries of those tables also gets slower the more intricate the relationships of the data gets. It can get to a point the SQL engine dies and crashes the server as the memory gets full while it compiles the query results in RAM before sending the final results to the user. If you need to find unknown insights of data based on its relationship its better to migrate the data to a graph database engine like Neo4j.,True

@CarlosEsquivel71,2021-06-12T08:57:38Z,2,"excel is a great tool, but it must be handled with care. Users love excel spreadsheets because it's easy to use and they can easily integrate spreadsheets into therir daily workflow. If some care is taken, you can use excel without great trouble. Some things I learned (the hard way) along many years are: 1) Don't store data in spreadsheets (BIG NO). Store data in a SQL Database and use that data from the spreadsheet by using the tools provided by excel to connect to databases. 2) Don't use the query builder provided with excel, instead, put your query into a stored procedure and just call that sp from excel. SP's are way more tractable, a DBA can get lots of usage statistics about sp's and if some changes are made in the undarlying structure of the database, you only need to modify that SP instead of changing every single excel file. 3) This is a bit difficult one, but the rewards are huge. Spreadsheets tend to ""spread"", and if no care is taken, that spread can become a realy nightmare. At some time, we had over 50.000 spreadsheets in the company (we made a ""bot"" for counting them). We are not interested in traking every single excel file, we are interested in tracking only thoose that connect to the company database. Normaly, an averange user can't make such a spreadsheet by himself, the will need some help from the IT deptartment, but once the file is created, nobody will stop him from making lot of copies and modifications, and there is where de hell begins. A way we found for mitigating this is, for every excel file usign db connections: a) register the file: assign an UUID for that file a and put it into the spreadsheet's VBA code. Every time a copy of de file is made, that UUID is inherited, so we can know where a spreadsheet came from, no matter the name of the copy. b) change the code of de event ""Workbook_Open"", so every time the file is open, that UUID is sent to a service along the name and location of the spreadsheet. We use that service to log excel ussage statistics, and the service response to verify if the spreadsheet is a valid or a deprecated one.",True

I kept insisting that they needed to give us access to SQL and the databases but because nobody understood how scripting can make those processed much more efficient they just told me to keep trying.

@Gaib_al_lisan,2021-06-02T17:55:40Z,1,"I have been stumbling on such problems with excel for a while now and can totally relate. I am a Simulation-Control Systems Engineer and in reality don't really need excel. But I have programmed thousands of lines of code and I am quickly growing tired of it (eyes hurting :P ). I use excel to make my sort of custom GUI for my work. At times wherein you have a problem with the speed, excel is capable of being integrated with other tools. You can even trigger stuff from excel and then get your results for visualization.  Great video by the way! Well structured and did not feel bored at all while watching!",True

Had they used the right version of Excel spreadsheet they would actually have been OK, but they used the plain XLS version that has a very small row limit. And yes, I like Python for SQL queries.",True
@connozac1109,2021-05-31T22:31:26Z,1,You've described two roles one is a insight analyst and the other an MI BI Analyst. One does reporting excel and makes slides. The other is BI building dashboard  using something like SSRS or Power BI for dashboards. The issues arise when teams build in house dashboards using insight analysts that generally use Excel. The reason excel and these dashboard won't go away is because of cost. It's cheaper to make an excel tool to do the day to day than to build a whole CRM system. It's easier for analysts to use Excel because management use Excel it has a lower entry bar and analysts that know excel are cheaper. If management knew Jupiter notebook or python then the bar would be higher... It would be great if business would use the right tool for the job but they don't because of cost and available knowledge...,True

@olemew,2021-05-30T21:20:46Z,0,"Agreed 100%. As somebody that spent and still spends time with Excel, and see its value and capabilities, I was shocked by the disdain some python/R folks show for Excel and even Microsoft in general.  Guess what, in many use cases and industries, if you master Excel you can make a difference. Not everybody works with heavy datasets, and not everybody can be or want to be a programmer. If those were the only options available, many people would have been left out in the last decades, and many products/ services / ideas would have never achieved the quality/price we enjoy today.",True

Whereas in the early - mid 80's when I was starting out with computers in business we would automatically use databases for heavy datasets and/or a relevant programming language depending on job. This was also a thing 35 or so years ago and not many people learnt the lesson. Seen many companies come to grief with this.",True
