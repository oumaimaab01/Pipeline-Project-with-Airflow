@vanerk_,2024-01-09T12:13:57Z,1,"Mr. Alammar, your post with gpt2 explanation is great, I frequently return to it, because it is very detailed and visual; A lot of time has passed, it would be awesome to see the same post explaining more modern LLMs such as llama 2 (for instance). I wish I could read the explanation of the ""new"" activations, norms, embeddings used in modern foundation models. Looking forward for such post!",True

@SatyaRao-fh4ny,2023-12-15T23:59:54Z,0,"I think it is unfortunate that the word 'model' is used so often everywhere that it becomes difficult to understand what it means. e.g is it LLM ""tokenizer foo"" or LLM ""model foo""? Are they the same? is bert-base-cased a ""model""(if so, what does it mean?), or a ""tokenizer"" that has N number of tokens in its dictionary?  Another question that is a bit fuzzy is, a ""model"" that uses a particular tokenizer must ""know"" what these tokens are, and must have a corresponding embeddings for every one of the tokens supported by the tokenizer it is using.  So, speaking of tokenizers in isolation, without the downstream ""model""(?) that is tied to this tokenizer is a bit confusing. I am still unclear on the flow of these tokenizer->embeddings->output-vector->some-decoder etc...",True
