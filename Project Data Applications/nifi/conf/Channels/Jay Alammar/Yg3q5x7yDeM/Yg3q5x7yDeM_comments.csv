@juanpablopajaro9229,2022-10-28T22:14:30Z,0,"Jay, I was exploring SHAP for explainable deep learning, and it didn¬¥t work. The git mentioned an update in TensorFlow that conflicts with SHAP. What do you know about that?",True

@jeanpauldelamarre6583,2021-07-29T07:08:32Z,2,Explainable AI is not only based on neural networks. Everyone wants to make neural networks explainable which is not the case by design. You also have to consider other types of models like rule based models (expert systems) or even probabilistic models which are explainable by design.,True
@chathurijayaweera1590,2021-07-24T02:17:59Z,0,Very informative and easily understandable. Thank you for making this video,True

@moseswai-mingwong8307,2021-05-04T14:33:39Z,0,Just wonder if FAIR's recent DINO model can give a hand on explainability too. This self-supervised training model is able to highlight multiple regions in an image for which a CV model should be focusing on. https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dino-paws-computer-vision-with-self-supervised-transformers-and-10x-more-efficient-training/,True

@moustafa_shomer,2021-04-30T20:19:32Z,0,"The example based part was kind of shallow, you didn't talk about how they figure out the specific flaws in the model",True
@MeriJ-ze5dd,2021-04-30T01:17:02Z,1,"Thanks Jay. Amazing video. I have a question though: why the pretraining in gpt-3 is called unsupervised learning?it works on labelled data, so I think it should be a supervised learning task.",True
@its_me7363,2021-04-29T16:36:01Z,14,Now I think it would be great if Jay can make video on SHAP explanability and usage...hope you have time to accept this request.,True
