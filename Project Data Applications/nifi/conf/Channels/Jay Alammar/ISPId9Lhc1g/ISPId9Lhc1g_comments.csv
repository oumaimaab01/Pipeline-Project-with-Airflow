@debbs_io,2024-04-13T12:09:01Z,0,I’ve watched a lot of videos on YouTube. So many with animations etc. I nearly lost hope thinking I would never be able to grasp this concept. This is the only one that truly explains what the word embedding is and how it’s being derived in just a simple manner. Thank you so much,True

@Udayanverma,2023-10-15T02:15:47Z,1,instead of explaining you went scrolling pages'. it was better if you have just kept it short and may be make other vid for subsequent sections.,True
@sahipadhai,2023-08-27T11:00:39Z,0,"Nice video explanation. But if you actually want to understand the mathematical foundation behind this model in Hindi and English mixed language, you can refer to videos in my channel. I have made all the concepts such that people can start from scratch and understand it clearly which can be supplemented with practical understanding. Here is the link to my channel . https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeWlQOzq28IIS8qVh8jawgg  BTW, thank you for making students life easier :)",True
@bagamanocnon,2023-07-17T11:56:24Z,0,"jay, how does training LLMs differ from training text embedding models? or is an embedding model a byproduct of training an LLM? Like in transformers where text are converted to embeddings first before being fed to to the transformer blocks. Thanks!",True
