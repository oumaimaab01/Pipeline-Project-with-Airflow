@oosmanbeekawoo,2021-07-23T04:49:24Z,0,"What should I get from this? That AI in Natural Language Processing is still in its infancy?? Have you heard about Duolingo. I need to know whether AI can successfully be implemented in Language Learning. It seems to me Duolingo corrects homework based on the order of the tiles.   Gives you [boy] [am] [I] [a] (which he reads as [4] [2] [1] [3]. Just expects a correct order.)   [I] [am] [a] [boy] >>[1] [2] [3] [4]  That explains why (when it asks you to type) "" I am a boy "" is wrong but "" I am a boy. "" is correct! Just because of a dot! Sometimes it penalises FOR writing a dot. I'm guessing it checks the database for the exact sentence as opposed to language recognition.",True

@SreeramAjay,2021-07-10T12:54:39Z,0,"Your videos, contents and explanations are really good. Thanks for making quality content.  It will be more nice, if you speak with same pitch as a start till the end of the sentence. Because words at the end of the sentences are low in volume.  Thanks again for the great videos",True

@manavmadan793,2021-06-28T12:18:16Z,2,"Great Video,  But using a small test set for QA should be done carefully as with time model can over-fit on those datasets.",True
