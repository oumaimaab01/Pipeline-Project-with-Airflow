In the case of the React demo, are we not essentially training GPT-3 by giving samples of code for some input?

This question is because you mentioned as of now GPT-3 does not do any fine-tuning/update of weights.",True

The model has already been trained with the text of this law and associated that text with ""the 1st law of robotics"".  Correct?
