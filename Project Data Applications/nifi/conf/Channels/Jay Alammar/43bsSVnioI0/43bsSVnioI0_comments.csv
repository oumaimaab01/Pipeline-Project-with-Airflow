@FiXato,2023-01-02T12:41:36Z,1,"Nicely made, though I do think it kinda lacks a uniform art style when it's not made by an actual artist. Plus, there always remains the question how much of the training data has been taken from artists who didn't agree to be part of the data set, and how close the generated art might actually still be to the source material.",True
