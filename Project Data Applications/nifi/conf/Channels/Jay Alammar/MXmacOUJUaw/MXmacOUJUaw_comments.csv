For Example: if I forgot to write CONTACT US, BUY NOW, CONTACT NUMBER, SPELLING MISTAKE, etc... in my social media post. that the tool finds error and suggests what are missing or what is incorrect in social media post.  üôè Please guide me and suggest what course I need to buy or what I need to learn to create this tool  Thank you!",True

Its like Maya‚Äîbut with words, and using 1B+‚Äôpre-trained models (images with their text descriptions) from the Internet wired up with plain English, so you don‚Äôt have to build the models in 3D, you can just type what you want to create using plain English, and the AI renders out the image.",True

@karthik8972,2023-08-31T04:04:46Z,0,"Thanks Jay for the video, the concept of converting noised image to a clear image is understood.   How does it creates a image which doesn't exist in its training ? It is understood that the model doesn't understand the concepts of the image and only focuses on the patterns. But how is the below operations performed,     1. Creating a cartoon image of cat based on caption ex: Place a  hat on top of cat         How does it creates a cartoon image of cat ?        How does it know the exact location of cat's head ?        How does it know to place the hat exactly at the head ?   2. A closeup shot of a dog facing the sun       How does it knows to create a close shot of a dog ?        How does it know to place the sun in the background ?       How it makes the the object to turn towards the sun ?   No videos exist to explain this concept. It would be of great help if you could make a video on this.",True
@jamiewatts333,2023-07-02T12:13:26Z,0,"Is this simplified explanation of the process of noise in Stable Diffusion true?   It's like teaching an artist about our visual world -- object definitions, shapes, dimensions, etc., and how they correspond to the person who commissioned the art (text prompts).  The artist then watches a mosaic - say of an ice cream - being inserted by hundreds of tesserae (rectangular slabs used to create a mosaic) and then removed to restore the original mosaic. During this, the artist learns how to understand, recreate, and reinterpret the ‚Äòice cream‚Äô image in other mosaics. The artist goes through this with millions of other depictions in mosaics (objects, locations, etc.) so they can create entirely new mosaics based on the requests (or text prompts) of the person commissioning them.  Sampling steps are like commissioning an artist to interpret and construct a mosaic quickly or carefully. The more detail or accuracy you want, the more work and time have to go into it.",True
@daveonvr2192,2023-06-22T13:46:41Z,0,"Thanks Jay - I had been looking for something that does more than describe the denoising process and the attention bit related to prompts is what I was missing. That said, I still can't quite understand how you get a completely new image. I can understand that you should be able to get back to an original image (say a dog, or a flower) via the noisification and reverse process, but how can it, say, create an image with a flower and the dog such they are integrated in some way? Where does that data that come from? A visual example of the earlier stages which show this would be helpful. The examples you had jumped from basically to an image (albeit unrefined) in 3 steps - I'd like to see this broken down so I can ""see"" what is happening. Still requires a level of acceptance without evidence that I am not happy with....",True

@d.p.5874,2023-03-11T18:35:13Z,1,"Thanks Jay for all your efforts to share a bit of your knowledge in AI. I am not an expert, by far, but I came to the conclusion that AI is mainly a construction of hundreds of lego bricks, assembled together into specific architectures and trained with the same gradient back propagation algorithm. Some of them perform well some other don't. Therefore, the only genuine piece of AI theory is the mathematical background of the training algorithm. The rest is pure heuristics more  or less  well explained, a kind of AI cook books with ad hoc recipees. The training algorithm itself seems very limited (even if highly powerful), since it is applied in a centralized way onto a predefined architecture and does not participate to the architecture topology definition. In other words, the topology is defined before the training while, intituively,  the training should probably define the topology. Therefore incremental learning remains a big issue in most of the AI architectures if not all. This lack of a consistent and unified AI theory (there is no, to my limited knowledge, any AI theorems nor demonstrations that some sort of optimum is reached using a given  architecture) makes me believe that we are at the very beginning of a new science still to come. Could you react to the above humble considerations and share your thoughts ? Kind regards,",True

@nerdfinite,2023-01-16T22:08:33Z,1,"Not all photographs are art, but photography can be an art. The nonsense I draw in a game of Pictionary has no craftsmanship or personal expression. However, illustration is an important form of art.  Not only would the AI never produce art on its own, it would never produce anything. The amount of craftsmanship and personal expression being put into the image is dependent on the person using it. A low effort random prompt to the AI is arguably not art, but that's not really the point.",True
