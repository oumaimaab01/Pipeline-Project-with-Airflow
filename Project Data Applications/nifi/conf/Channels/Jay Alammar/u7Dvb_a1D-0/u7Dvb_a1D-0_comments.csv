@Murphyalex,2021-06-10T22:05:12Z,5,"Correct on the Scandinavian points. Written Norwegian is just historically imported Danish (they even call it, ""Book language"") with a few tiny changes added later (they can almost perfectly read each other's languages) and Swedish is also very similar. They're part of a dialect continuum and not really different ""languages"" from the perspective of a lack of mutual intelligibility. It's for political and historical reasons we consider them as such, today. Main differences lie in the spoken language, anyway. Written, which is what NLP models see, they're all very, very similar.",True
