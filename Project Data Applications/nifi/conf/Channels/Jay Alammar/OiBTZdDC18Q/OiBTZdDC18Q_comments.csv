It gives me some motivation to keep working on the next one (based on my lecture series), probably not starting with iris the next time ;)   Unfortunately O'Reilly only prints in color in very rare cases, which is a bit sad but makes sense, I'm still figuring out how to ensure my next one will be in color!
