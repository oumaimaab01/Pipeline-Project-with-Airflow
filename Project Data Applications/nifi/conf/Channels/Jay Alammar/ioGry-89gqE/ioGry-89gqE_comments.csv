@CheeseCakes11944,2024-02-27T02:41:14Z,0,"I got lost, when you said the article is represented as a vector or vectors at 4:34. How is it creating only one or 3 vectors from an entire article?",True
@Fussfackel,2024-02-07T20:53:27Z,0,"Although we mainly see decoder-only models nowadays with LLMs, this is still super helpful, thanks Jay!",True

@hdubbs9174,2022-03-16T16:00:49Z,2,"Can I ask you which program you use to make your graphics? They look nice!  Edit: I found out it's keynote! (In case anyone was wondering). In that case, would you be willing to make a video on how you make your blog posts? They are amazing and you have a real gift at explaining concepts! It's a bit meta, but I think it would be really interesting.",True
@AliS-th1ck,2021-11-03T13:09:36Z,4,"Great video, thanks! Do you have any idea which similarity score tends to perform the best when computing the similarities between the sentence embeddings? I suppose cosine similarity, but are there some more exotique ones that you can recommend?",True
@womeninairobotics1302,2021-11-03T08:57:08Z,3,Excellent video Jay! You are a natural educator.,True

@chrisw1462,2021-08-05T12:57:20Z,0,"I'm betting BERT even finds listening to your voice tedious with all of the high frequencies CUT OFF.  I don't know who started this trend, and I don't care.  It's moronic and it sounds AWFUL.  Human speech has most of it's differentiation around 4kHz.  When you cut most of that band out, it's harder to understand and tiring to listen to.  STOP already.   Between that and half the video being taken up by 'Who has used BERT'... Sorry.. downvoted.",True
@sasna8800,2021-08-03T20:55:04Z,0,Great are you going to explain coding for BERT,True
@WalkAloneLive,2021-08-03T13:17:17Z,0,Too good. Thanks,True
@evertonlimaaleixo1084,2021-07-12T16:33:06Z,0,Great!  I have a doubt: Why should you only look to the first column?,True
