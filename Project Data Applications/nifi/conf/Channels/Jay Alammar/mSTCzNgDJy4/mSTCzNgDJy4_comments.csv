@JamesBreiner,2023-10-02T21:57:12Z,0,"These are excellent examples of how AI prediction models are used. Great stuff for explaining the value and use of AI to the general public, because everyone in an audience will have bumped into many of these companies and enjoyed or suffered from their recommendations. In the case of fraud detection, I have been the beneficiary of some of these prediction engines in that my financial services providers have quashed fraudulent attempts to use my data illicitly. Simple explanations, direct, but profound in their implications and widely applicable. Thank you, Jay.",True
