@podunkman2709,2024-05-21T09:55:51Z,0,"Take look at this demo:  >>> How many liters of water per minute can a Dutch windmill pump out? That's an interesting question!  The answer depends on the specific design and size of the windmill. However, I can give you some general information.  Traditionally, Dutch windmills are designed to pump water from shallow sources, such as polders or wells, for irrigation purposes. The capacity of these windmills varies greatly, but a typical small to medium-sized windmill might be able to pump around 0.5 to 2 liters per minute (L/min).  Some larger industrial-scale windpumps can pump much more, up to 10-20 L/min or even more, depending on the turbine design and the pressure head of the water.  Really? What a sh****",True
