@ms.k.kiruthikadept.ofcompu510,2022-08-24T05:47:37Z,0,Hi Sir ThanQ so much for all ur videos. I have a doubt. u mentioned that u took the stock data from Yahoo Finance. It seems only the headlines (text data) are considered for Analysis. What is the purpose of Historic data (Stock data)? csv file too contains only headlines. Did i missed anything in this video? Kindly reply when u have time.,True

@swapnilingale1075,2021-03-26T04:49:01Z,0,What to do after writing this script? How to run the model?,True
@lixinlin4563,2021-01-26T16:13:03Z,1,"it seems that part of your testing data are used for training. When splitting training and testing dataset, we should use 'yyyy-mm-dd' as the date format.",True
@dataanalytics2593,2021-01-22T17:54:07Z,0,Sir great work ..i watched this video but still i have confusen... From accuracy what i have predict price increase or decrease...... Nd what is the final output.. I think it will be bore question.. i have confusen so i have to asked..,True
@vatanpatel6011,2020-09-11T07:46:22Z,0,"Krish, I like your videos. But you have made a mistake here.  You took overlapping training and testing datasets. This is why the accuracy is at 85%. With random train_test_split, the accuracy falls down to 52%. Please use Cross Validation for the same.",True
@deepsheth4905,2020-08-28T08:59:16Z,1,Where and how did you scrape the news from?,True
@ravichilka1474,2020-08-25T05:42:31Z,0,"Brother how can you overlapp the training and testing dataset ,,,,, (time)3:28   training<2015 test>2014 then testing within range 2014-2015 will always get correct answer so,accuracy automatically increases...... Hence, 80% accuracy from news (lol),,,,,,,everyone would have become millionaire by then. Though I liked your approach,,,,,,,Thank You",True

@susovandey1875,2020-03-10T06:31:32Z,2,"Hi Krish... I tried the same code in my system and i have a few queries. Here is what i did 1. Uploaded data in dataframe. 2. Did preprocessing of the whole data and created a combined column containing all the headlines. 3. Then used countvectorizer on this data.  4. Used random forest classifier just like you showed.   Questions :  1. I am getting error ""Cannot allocate xxxx bytes of memory..--------> Please tell me why I am getting that. Though it worked on google collab. (Laptop I am using has I5 9th Gen...8GB RAM and integrated graphics card) 2. Why did you not use test train split? Also in your code some of the training data was present in the test data. Data redundant...When i corrected it the accuracy came down to 55%. 3. In the countvectorizer how are you finding out whether it should be univariate or multivariate [why you selected ngram_range=(2,2) and not (1,2)] I am new in this and might be asking a stupid question also....Please help me out.",True

@mattcirelli6019,2019-07-02T16:49:09Z,0,"Hi Krish great video, I see you've used the DJIA price to create the labels, suppose we wanted to create labels based on the word vectors (or unlabelled text) is that possible? my thinking is the categorical label would then be used to predict prices as part of a model with more features?",True
