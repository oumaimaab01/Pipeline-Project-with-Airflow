There may be 100s of mechanical engineers and civil engineers going through fomo now. It's a fact even if nobody wants to admit. And Hats off Krish Sir, for bringing it up as one of your videos.

You may be excellent but you are at the wrong field or domain or place, hence getting fomo. It doesn't mean you are worthless. When the playing field is level, you will prove your mettle. Believe in your skillsets, believe in your goals, BELIEVE IN YOU.",True
