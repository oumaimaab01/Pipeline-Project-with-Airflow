@JoEl-jx7dm,2024-02-23T17:40:47Z,0,"Krish i need help here,  I have a query that has been bothering me a lot lately, and I don't have many people to help me clear it up. I would appreciate your assistance.  Recently, I have been experimenting with LLMs and Langchain. I have created an application that helps store managers retrieve essential and high-quality insights from their database. And i have built it on top of Streamlit  My query is, now that I have been learning Html, css and javascript, how do I combine or integrate this data science application into an actual website?  What I mean is, I would like to do both jobs in this project: the data science job as well as the web development job.  Perhaps I will create a chatbot that uses LLMs and LangChain to query the database in natural language and retrieve information if the user logs in as the admin of the website. It should display a separate UI for the managers if they log in, so they can use my data science application.  To be able to do this project properly, what are the fundamentals? Could you provide me with a roadmap to ensure I'm heading in the right direction or if something could be helpful?",True
