@sumitmishra1787,2022-07-12T00:28:56Z,0,"Hie sir, i recently started learning from your videos and its amazing. I did my masters in business analytics from US. I tried running decision trees after selecting features using filter method and chi2 but i thought that around 20 variables of the 175 variables which i got after one hot encoding is necessary. But when i constructed the decision tree the plot was very small and the depth of the tree was also very large. What should we do in such scenarios.?",True
