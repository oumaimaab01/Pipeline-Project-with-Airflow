@siddharthasinha520,2021-04-12T08:52:41Z,0,"This approach is not 100% correct. It shows which attributes are good. Those which can clearly separate the target into two classes are good variables. Thus this is at best a feature selection method. But often multiple variables together can also create a clear separation. So by doing pairplots, it may lead to high false negatives against the suitability of logistic regression. Better way is to take 10-20 smaller chunks from different locations and apply all algorithms. The ones which show consistently better performance (with least variaton)is a good algorithm for the given data.",True

@satriogani3105,2020-05-04T08:52:30Z,1,"In the pairwise plot, the points are only plotted on two dimensions. However, our data have dimensions more than two. This means that we do not plot the other features. It looks that we do some projection from higher dimensional space to two dimensional space. Can we conclude if the groups overlap with each other only by looking on two dimensional plots? Simple example, if we project the earth on two dimensional space, we can see that the norther and southern hemisphere will overlap on each other.",True
