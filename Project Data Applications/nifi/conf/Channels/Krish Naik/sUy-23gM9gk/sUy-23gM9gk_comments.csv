@adipurnomo5683,2021-10-07T14:50:39Z,0,Great video krish naik.,True
@shwetadalal1549,2021-08-07T19:30:07Z,4,First we will see the type of problem. supervised/unsupervised? classification/regression?...then we will try out multiple ml models for each case and see which model gives best accuracy,True

@prateekreddybatapatis7269,2021-06-08T17:14:08Z,1,How to resolve 'XGBoost error: bad allocation' in multiclass image classification? Please let me know.,True
@phanindraparashar8930,2021-06-07T18:46:45Z,6,"In my opinion, algorithm is the last important thing. More important is whats the end use. What is the predection used for? Is it safety critical or not?  Is predection more important or is understanding causality more important?  (Hypothesis testing)  Also depends on tradeoff between generalisation and accuracy(or similar metrics) that is needed for the client.   Do we also need to estimate the uncertainty in our predection?  (Basian approach)  What if we don't have the data? What of we khow the dynamics of environment only like Autonomous Driving? (Reinforcement Learning)  In reinforcement learning also - do u know the dynamics of the environment?  (Model free vs model based)  I think for answering this question, it is important to mention that as a data scientist our focus is towards understanding the needs of the client, get to know about the quality and quantity of data we have.   In the simple case of working with a real estate company (a venture capital firm which funds many real estate projects (both sales and rent))  Predection of price may not be that important. Their focus is towards what micro and macro factors influence the price and rent?  What would be the impact of price of a house if we have additional supermarket within 1km or 500m? Which micro factors are more significant?  (Area of house, balcony, etc..)  If this is a problem statement, probably the best algorithm would be a discrete choice modelling and Hypothesis testing to understand the business in a much more detail.",True

@balapranav5364,2021-06-07T10:40:09Z,2,Hi Krish in one of my interview I faced questions like. 1. What is the loss function in collaborative filtering 2. How we can use regularisation techniques in collaborative filtering  Can you please explain,True
@raghuvararora9673,2021-06-07T09:28:14Z,1,STAR should be used to structure the ideas,True
@trojanatom6836,2021-06-07T08:35:58Z,4,I prefer your old style of teaching rather than using whiteboard/blackboard. It's a good question though!,True

@datascientistoflife8550,2021-06-07T08:11:02Z,1,It depends on type of data then we can only deside which algo to be applied..,True
@vasudeva5345,2021-06-07T07:25:05Z,1,Can anyone suggest me a book to refer for Python learning. I am new to this course..,True
@reenasheoran893,2021-06-07T06:47:18Z,18,"I think this question should be tackled in a hierarchical manner. For example, 1. First, check does the data have a label column- if yes (go with supervised learning) else (go with unsupervised learning).   2. Second, check is the problem prediction or classification. 3. Third, check size of data. If the data is too large go with ANN else Machine Learning 4. Fourth, apply basic algorithm such as linear, svm, etc. first 5 Now, apply ensemble techniques.",True
@ajaykushwaha-je6mw,2021-06-07T06:21:05Z,2,I also follow the same approach which you have suggested.,True

@satyanagajyothi4514,2021-06-07T05:43:19Z,8,Hi Krish...even i faced the same question in interview and said i will go and apply all the algos and select based on trial and error and will select the best model with good metrics.. but the interviewer said that it is not proper approach to select a model on trial and error ...,True
@yogita4631,2021-06-07T05:35:48Z,4,"Visualisation of data using seaborn library ,if my data point are linearly separable then I use linear regression and logistic regression if not the I go for ensemble techniques , and SVM",True
