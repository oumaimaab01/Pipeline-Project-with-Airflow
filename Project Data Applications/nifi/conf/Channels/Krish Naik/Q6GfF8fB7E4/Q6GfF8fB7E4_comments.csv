There will be cross- questions to understand you really know the stuff or not. And to be honest these fake kind of resume  (only certi no knowledge) is making DS hiring very challenging. Even good candidates are seen as fakers because of high number of these kind of resumes.  No hard feeling for anybody, I understand they are trying to be in this emerging domain. but they also need to understand what they are doing to the eco-system of DS.

How can someone can have a end to end implementation experience if nobody gave him the chance to have some project in this.  The only way I see is that the guys himself create his own project. If it includes Cloud , we do not all have the money to be able to use GCP, AWS or azure technology ( it cost a lot of money ). If it does not include cloud and the guy manage to have an end to end implementation of user case ? that's already a ""start-up"" like the guys made himself  ""solving a problem""",True

It makes me wonder if the instructors have ever deployed a machine learning model or other data product to a production environment (real or simulated). I am completing the final year of a data science degree; I have been giving considerable thought to how to showcase my skills through a portfolio.    By the way, most of the so-called professional training courses offered by major universities in association with third-party organizations, such as Emeritus, are not worth the fees - they are cashing in but delivering little to no value that cannot be found on YouTube or elsewhere online for free or at significantly lower cost and higher value in terms of real skills.

@justmyreviews1989,2020-12-31T08:51:16Z,32,True !!! Certification doesn't matter knowledge is important.,True
@vahiagyat,2020-12-31T08:50:54Z,578,"@Krish Naik    That sounds like me 1 year back!  From my personal experience: I went for tooooooooooo many certifications! Even completed Simplilearn Masters. I was able to do all the projects in the courses. But when I got my first interview call - after various models related questions, the interviewer asked me - how and where are you going to deploy it? If your model is starting after a long time it can take some time - how you handle that? How you build an auto-deploy model? And literally, I had no clue!!! Obviously, I didn't get that job.  I don't want to make it a review of any certification but most of the certifications miss the end-to-end implementation. You get data in excel - do cleaning and all, select model do hyperparam tuning and evaluate and then with the best result submit your project - and you are done! They don't even touch on how you will retrain the model - when you keep getting new data.  I was following Krish's channel but my mindset was also that way - I used to find videos for a specific thing and used to go through it. It did help, In the interview, I was able to explain the mathematics and logic behind it.  But obviously, a company needs someone who can put the model in production NOT ON PAPER.  Post first interview experience only, I started considering any project/use case from starting to end. For example, from finding out a use case to giving it to the client and then improving the model while running in production.   I am NOT a pure data scientist. I am a Data Science Technical Product and Program Manager. And that makes it more important for me to know things end to end.  Instead of certification, start showcasing these in platforms - it can be any platform, Linked In, even FB, Twitter, etc. People prefer seeing even a simple running model compared to a complicated theoretical model on paper. Github is by default considered but you need to market what you have done - social media can come in handy there.  P.S: wanna add one important point which I missed above - post any interview please do analyze what was asked and be honest to yourself, whether you knew that and were you able to explain it in simple words. And, when you find a concept which you didn't know - go in-depth of that don't just limit yourself to what the last interviewer asked. very basic example - someone asked you 'recall' and you didn't know. Then don't just come back and check what recall is. Read about all the common metrics, and more importantly when you will prefer what, and why? If possible have some examples ready. Recently, in an interview, I asked what is precision and recall and in reply, I got the formula. Formula is good but it's always better to explain the concept and practical usage  Addition on 6th Jan: I want to clarify one point. After reading this comment, many people are concluding Simplilearn's course is useless (many people reached out to me). I just want to clarify this is not the case - I have mentioned where they are lagging. Otherwise, their courses are pretty good and few faculties are outstanding. It's just that ROI is not that great. But definitely the course is not useless - I learned the fundamentals of GANs there only. It's up to us what we do with the foundation. I created one simple deepfake using the learning from that and other papers - https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6751891497441988608/  Addition on 19th Jan : Got so many requests and queries on selecting courses/certifications. Hence, wrote a quick blog - hop it helps: https://anantjigyasa.com/how-to-select-data-science-courses/",True
