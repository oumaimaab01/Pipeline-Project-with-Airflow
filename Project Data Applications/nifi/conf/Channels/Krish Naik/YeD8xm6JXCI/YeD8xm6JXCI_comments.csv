@siddhantkohli5063,2024-04-23T02:28:55Z,2,The ground reality is that most students shift there focus from learning basics to Llms etc. Learn the basics first.. No firm is going to put you directly on a llm project as a fresh data scientist or ml engineer you need to work on ground level and then make ur way up to the trends and follow the trends   Krish sir taught me so much so it’s my pleasure to help people in community as well. So stick to basics first get into the dirty work or cleaning etl advance stats ml dl and then move to llms   Thank you,True
