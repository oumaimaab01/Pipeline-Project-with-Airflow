@ramadhiantoagung5086,2021-11-04T12:29:46Z,2,"Tested on my personal pc with RTX 2060, its quite promising for my job (corp finance, report monitoring, dashboard, data engineering, and the likes. Glorified number cruncher basically)  My work pc has quadro rtx 4000 and quadro rtx 5000, but windows only due to global policy. Its boost paralel workload like crazy, but WSL is bottlenecking the IO.  For now i havent made the decision to switch from Dask to Cudf (or Dask-Cudf since i got those 2 unit) since most of my workload are IO intensive (interprocesses data are dumped into NVME cache disk for audit purposes), but once WSL solved its IO challenges OR my workplace allow Linux, ill make the call.",True
