@tikendraw,2021-10-10T06:15:25Z,0,"sir, since we are just assigning count numbers to the categorical values and even it may lead to problematic situation  if the counts are same , why don't we use label encoding in each columns , YEs it may not be the ordinal data but it does better job then what this method that you are talking about is doing.the Goal is to assign numbers to strings . -- I may be wrong but according to the info you provided what i said should work too , and it is easier. CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG @KRISH NAIK",True

@anilsunny4443,2021-01-15T08:32:52Z,0,"I thought we were to consider the top 10 most frequent labels and perform one hot encoding on them, but this is completely different :/. Somebody pls help, I'm a beginner at this and some lead on this would be greatly appreciated.",True
@srishtikumari6664,2020-12-27T06:33:39Z,1,"Thanks for sharing this video! I was looking for this type of code for replacement of column with it's count column. I am learning feature engineering from kaggle couses. There, count_encoder() is used and I was trying to write code for steps used in the count_encoder() which I find in this video.  I have a doubt, the column in that tutorial was numerical and both the column (col and count_column) were used in predicting output and calculating the validation score. I calculated validation score using both the ways (i.e.included both col & count_col and then only count_col), I found score to be higher in the model using both(col & count_col). Can you please clarify, should we use the original column as well if it's numerical ?",True
