@deepkachhawa2256,2022-05-31T18:25:21Z,0,The assumption of linear regression mainly talks about the error terms and is not related to X and Y.

@BlasterMate,2021-01-07T17:34:50Z,18,"The normality assumption for linear regression applies to the errors, not the outcome variable per se (and most certainly not to the explanatory variables).
