@deeptithakur3661,2021-03-30T21:31:09Z,1,"No quality. Such a waste of time Krish. Things should be planned better. No clarity and the answers given are not showing how the AI is used. Given answer is always that machine learning can be used, interviewer should asked ""How"" and ""Why"", where is the data how the data can be used, and why  machine learning algorithms should be applied. Many of the problems can also be solved using statistics but now a days people are trying to fit machine learning without understanding the actual problem.",True
