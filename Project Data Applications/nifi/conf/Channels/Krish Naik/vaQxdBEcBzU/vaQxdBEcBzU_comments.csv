@milanmishra309,2024-01-06T06:44:05Z,0,"Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting): When a model has low bias and high variance, it means that the model is able to fit the training data very well (low bias), but it is overly sensitive to the specific training examples and may not generalize well to new, unseen data (high variance). Overfitting is characterized by capturing noise or random fluctuations in the training data. To find an optimal model, there is a trade-off between bias and variance. The goal is to strike a balance that minimizes both bias and variance, leading to a model that generalizes well to new data. Techniques such as regularization and cross-validation are commonly used to address overfitting and find a suitable compromise between bias and variance.",True

@NeeRaja_Sweet_Home,2022-02-03T05:17:12Z,22,"Hi Krish, Is the below steps was correct for regression problem.  1. In linear Regression Model first we will do EDA, Feature Engineering, Data Pre-processing and will split data into Train and Test. 2. Creating model using Linear Regression and evaluate the model like finding Loss and R2 Square. 3. If we could see more Loss then we have to do optimization using gradient decent and stochastic gradient decent for minimizing the Loss 4. Finally we have to check Bias and Variance trade-off if model getting overfitting then use L1 regularisation for preventing overfitting and L2 regularisation for preventing overfitting and feature selection as well.
