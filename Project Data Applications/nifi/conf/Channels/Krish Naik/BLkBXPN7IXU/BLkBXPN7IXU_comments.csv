@venkatesh532,2023-07-17T15:12:52Z,0,Finally i broke blackbox of Bias & Variance.. Thank you Krish 🙏🙏,True
@ManojKumar-ge4dj,2023-04-04T22:06:20Z,0,To be corrected....definition of high and low bias in training data set,True
@ikram_6024,2023-02-03T16:07:57Z,0,"Thank you for this clear presentation. I have a question about low variance variable, how to find low variance variable (threshold)  , why and when we should remove this variables ?",True
@sidharth1452,2022-07-02T19:09:56Z,18,"Hello guys,  Please don't get confused. For Training data :- Good accuracy --> low bias Bad accuracy --> high bias For Testing data:- Good accuracy --> low variance Bad accuracy --> high variance",True
@VijayBhaskarSingh,2022-06-29T07:51:59Z,0,"your explanation is wrong at 3:14. A model performing well on training dataset will have high training accuracy, low error/Bias. Bias is the measurement of error. Model fit (Y_hat) against the existing training dataset (x). The delta between (y_hat) and training points is the Bias.",True
@karrmanbhatia4261,2022-05-11T19:44:15Z,2,Krish i think you mentioned wrongly in case of bias at 3.20min.... when model is performing well on training data it means error is low  and this is low bias case but you said when model is performing well on training data its high bias  high bias means high training error,True
@anandvyavahare2031,2022-02-09T03:40:57Z,3,3:14 I think you said it opposite.,True
@saitarun6562,2022-02-08T17:47:39Z,1,thanks kirsh for this video model 1(example for over fitting) and model 2(example for under fitting) finally model 3 is perfect model to use.,True
@suriyaprakashkk9365,2022-02-08T14:31:43Z,4,"3:14 low bias ......not high bias.....bias and varience is just a error respect to training dataset and test (Validation) data set.....when model perform well, it means low error.",True
@rafibasha1840,2022-02-08T11:02:51Z,2,Low bias/low variance  :When model is performing well on both train and test   High bias :When model is neither performing good at training/test   High variance :Performing well on train but not on test,True
@deen4803,2022-02-08T10:39:26Z,0,Sir please continue mySQL series also,True
@rafibasha1840,2022-02-08T09:13:36Z,24,3:14 it should be low bias when model is performing well,True
@JaiRudraNath,2022-02-08T08:00:10Z,2,I think you explaining in white board the traditional way is far far better than digital board..,True
@sumanreddy4165,2022-02-08T06:27:40Z,4,"Sir, could you make videos on algebra and calculas, and how to code these in python to use these effectively in machine learning.",True
@vishaldas6346,2022-02-08T06:14:40Z,4,One can only understand these conpects better while implementing the same into their respective work. Your videos are worth watching and I urge people to practice such concepts into their respective projects to get clear idea.,True
@narayanbabubharali9846,2022-02-08T06:03:47Z,1,Nice,True
@prudhvimunjeti9232,2022-02-08T06:02:27Z,1,Once again rocked 🔥🔥,True
@dailyDiary213,2022-02-08T05:57:37Z,1,Sir agar m hp Pavillion aero 13 laptop leta hu to ye acha rhe ga long term k liy kyu k models to Google colab m train ho jay gy ap ka experience ka khehta h?,True
@AmanKumarSharma-de7ft,2022-02-08T05:53:58Z,10,In model 1 the accuracy training is high still u r saying low bias .....whereas u said high train accuracy means high bias,True
