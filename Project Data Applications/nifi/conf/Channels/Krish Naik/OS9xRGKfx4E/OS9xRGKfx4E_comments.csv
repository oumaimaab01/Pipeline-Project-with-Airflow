@sanmaypaniker2320,2024-05-20T18:19:51Z,0,"I had a doubt - Ideally, there wouldn't be any train needed in isolation forest is it? It will just predict, but if we have past data and an understanding that those do not contain anomalies, then which algorithm can be used for that? How can I use isolation forest for that?",True

@shashanksinghal8395,2023-11-04T00:21:20Z,0,I feel that contamination argument tells how  much proportion should be treated as outliers and not the threshold itself. threshold will be chosen based on the proportion of the outliers that we'll define. Please correct me if I am wrong.,True
