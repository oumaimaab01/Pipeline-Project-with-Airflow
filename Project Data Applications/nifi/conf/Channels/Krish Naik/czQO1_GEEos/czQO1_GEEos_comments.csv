I would like to make one correction here (at around 19:10 minutes) NumPy.random.normal(loc, std, size) creates n (=size) random variables with mean = loc, and std = std.  In your case data is basically a list of three arrays, each of which is a collection of 100 random normal variables with mean 0 and three different values of std respectively [given by range(1,4)]",True

First I have written the matplotlib import line & then (%matplotlib inline) & run it. So it got executed without plt.show(). Later I removed  (%matplotlib inline) & run it, but still it's reflecting the output, without writing plt.show() command.
