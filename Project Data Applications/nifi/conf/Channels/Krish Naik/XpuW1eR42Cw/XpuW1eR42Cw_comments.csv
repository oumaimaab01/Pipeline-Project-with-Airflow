@zyphtron,2022-01-26T17:57:31Z,22,"I managed to learn Data Science and ML on the following system due to my budget constraints. - Intel Core2 Duo processor (old laptop from 2007) - 4 GB DDR2 RAM - No dedicated graphics - 128 GB SSD Hard disk (I upgraded it from 160 GB HDD) My laptop was very slow on Windows, so I installed Lubuntu (Ubuntu LXDE) and was able to practice coding. I used free Google Colab whenever required. I recently got a very decent Data Science job at an MNC and then bought a laptop with 32 GB RAM and Nvidia graphics card because I want to try some deep learning. I still feel my new laptop is not really necessary because I can do all that in my office laptop too. But I think of it as a reward for getting a job, lol. The bottom-line is don't waste money on expensive laptops when you are not earning. You can still learn ML with whatever laptop you have. If you don't have one then buy a basic one.",True
