@prabhat4700,2021-10-15T12:53:01Z,14,"To be honest, this video had the most negative impact on my motivation to pursue data science. Till now I was in the bubble of belief that as someone from non-CS/IT background, with some effort, probably in 6 months or so, I would be able to make an entry in data science... But this video shattered everything.    It all seems extremely difficult all of a sudden, if not impossible. We have guys like him as our competition, who are working so hard to learn so much in so little time... Look at his resume.. and probably still jobless? Where do people like us stand?   By the time I learn some coding, the world of technology would have moved further ahead. When would I ever be able to catch up with the demand?  Why did I even assume I could beat the already existing competition of CS/IT crowd who are far ahead than me? Maybe it was just a dream out of desperation..  but it definitely isn't as easy as I believed it to be.. and probably one of those hopeless things",True
