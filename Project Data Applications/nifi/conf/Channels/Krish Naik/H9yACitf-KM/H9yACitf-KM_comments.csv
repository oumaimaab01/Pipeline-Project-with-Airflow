@shamshersingh9680,2021-02-27T15:05:53Z,0,Very nice video but I have few doubts:-  1. What is the actual significance of Support Vectors.  Are they just the data points which help create margins and is that there only role.  2. The hyperplane or ML model can classify data into two labels based on the position of data above or below hyperplane. So what role do the margin play. In any case the data will be classified as per their position above or below hyperplane. Hyperplane plays the critical role.  3. How increasing the margin will reduce generalization error.,True

@vamsikrishna9825,2020-07-01T05:33:53Z,0,Thanks for the session.nice tutorial. I have few questions which i didnt get 1) why we need to marginal planes i mean what exactly is the purpose of creating a marginal planes  around hyperplane. 2) can we call svm with only hyperplane is equal to linear regression when the data is linear?(i am not talking about nonlinear data).  3)what creates more advantage to the svm with more marginal distance than svm with less marginal distance. 4) If a real world data dont have sufficient marginal length how svm will perform then? thank you very much,True

I think kernel SVM tries to transforms  points from SOME dimensions to the OTHER  dimensions where the points r linearly separable or almost separable but not necessarily from lower to higher dimensions.we try different functions .... sometimes in real world we can‚Äôt Visualize the data ...so we believe in SOME dimensions data might  be separable....or might not be .. if it gives good results according to the metrics we have chosen, it‚Äôs nice  else  we go for other algorithms ...thanks for making this algorithm simple.nice explanation brother ...üëåüëåüëå",True

@swagatmishra9350,2020-04-28T18:47:03Z,2,Hd 1 q here. Is there any relation btw d+ and d-.  As in the 1st fig- d+ is the distance from the +eve support vector to the hyperplane and d- is the distance from the -eve support vector to the hyperplane.  So is d+ always equal to greater than or less than d- or there is no specific relation as such?   As always gr8 video and gr8 explanation. Thank you..,True
