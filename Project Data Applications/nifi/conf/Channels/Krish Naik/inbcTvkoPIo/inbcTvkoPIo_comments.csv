@souravsinha6129,2021-06-30T18:23:35Z,0,Sir I have a problem of imbalanced data set. Where class 0 is more than class 1. And as per problem statement class 1 is necessary to predict more accurately  When i applied the algo with parameter tuning my model was giving good prediction in term of less false positive. Now when I use SMOTE or up-sampling my model fails miserably to predict the class 1  but predicts the class 0 very good.  In this scenario what to do?  What should be the correct way. Please Answer.,True
