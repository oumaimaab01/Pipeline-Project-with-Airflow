@saptarshisanyal6738,2023-06-12T08:07:30Z,7,"To all the AI Learners, here's sharing recent interview experience from Biggest IT Company of india in their kolkata centre for SDE (ML) position for 3 years of experience . They asked each and every mathematical concept of Support Vector mechanism and PCA. These two are the most difficult topics of ML landscape. Even those who are working in Amazon find it difficult and explore new things each time they study these concepts. The entire linear algebra can get very tricky and you need to have very strong foundation in vectors, which is a difficult task. Dont expect that you will be asked to explain sklearn hyper parameters, instead expect that you have to write code from scratch and explain each vector computation.    If you are not comfortable in Linear Algebra then this field is not for you. Gradually so many students are studying ML, that in near future only best of best brains will get the job in AI.",True
