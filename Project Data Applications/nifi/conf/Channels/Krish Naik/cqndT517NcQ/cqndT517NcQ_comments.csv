@krishnaik06,2021-04-02T06:49:57Z,8,"So Finally we were able to see the model was really performing well with some error margin. We can still hyperparameter tune the model for better performance :). Happy Learning!! Neuron is coming up with the Affordable Machine Learning And Deep Learning Master Course. This batch is starting from 10th April and the timing will be 8am to 10am on Saturdays and Sunday and it will be live sessions.The course fees will be 3000 inr+18% GST. Download the syllabus and fill the form to reserve the seat http://ineuron1.viewpage.co/MLRDAPRIL Incase of any queries you can contact the below number. 8788503778 6260726925 9538303385 8660034247 9880055539",True
