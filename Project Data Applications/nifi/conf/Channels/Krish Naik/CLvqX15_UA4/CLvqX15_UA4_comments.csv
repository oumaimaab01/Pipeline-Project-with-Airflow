@zagesh.,2022-10-15T12:24:22Z,26,I applied 150+ companies from LinkedIn got 50+ rejection mail not even a single call for interview... I come from commerce background... Only btech students and IT experience people get jobs... And talking about intership projects i think they are too tough for a fresher. There are many technologies that you need to know. Everyone is just saying data science anyone can make transition from any field but all we see is students from btech... Most of the students from mechanical or btech have came into this and students like me have no chance of even getting interview call,True
