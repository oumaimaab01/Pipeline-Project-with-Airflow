@MrTapan1994,2020-07-03T06:40:12Z,0,I will explain the linear regression to a less educated student like: You came outside to purchase some apple. you went to a store and asked for the price. The shopkeeper told you that 1 apple price is 10 rs.  if you purchase 2 it will be 20. Think like you want to purchase 10 apples. Then How much you will pay to the shopkeeper ? If he told 100 rs. Then he knows y = mx . Later on i can explain in another case you were purchasing some other item for like banana.. for 3 bananas for 21 rs and 10 bananas for 60 rs. i can explain him about the 10rs is a bias or error to actual outcome. Please let me know is it will be enough.  ??,True

@bipinyadav934,2020-03-16T15:02:32Z,26,"I would like to explain linear regression using following example: The moment you sit in a cab ride, in a cab, you see that there's a fixed amount there, it says $2.50, $2.50 You rather that the cab moves or you get off, this is what you owe to the driver, the moment you step into a cab. That's a constant, you have to pay that amount, if you have stepped into a cab. Then as it starts moving, for every meter or 100 meters, the fare increases by a certain amount. So, there's a fraction, there's a relationship between distance and the amount you would pay, above and beyond that constant. If you're not moving, and you're stuck in traffic, then every additional minute, you have to pay more. As the minutes increase, your fare increases, as the distance increases, your fare increases, and while all this is happening, you've already paid a base fare, which is the constant. This is what regression is. Regression tells you what the base fare is and what is the relationship between time and the fare you have paid and the distance you have traveled and the fare you have paid. Because in the absence of knowing those relationships, and just knowing how much people traveled for, and how much they paid, regression allows you to compute that constant that you didn't know it was 2.50, and it would compute the relationship between the fare and the distance, and the fare and the time.",True
