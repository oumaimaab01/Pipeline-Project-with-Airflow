@nehamangal7860,2020-08-27T06:58:23Z,0,"Hey @KrishNaik,  I have switched my career(I've worked as a bureaucrat for 4 years)in data science 1-2 year back. I have been laid off 4 months back due to this Pandemic and my career aspiration to become a Data Science has been severely impacted.  I have been rigorously self studying from MIT OCW(Probability, Statistics), Edx, Coursera (ISLR, Andrew Ng- ML, DL) since last 1.5 years along with my internship and job as an analyst. I have gained deep theoretical knowledge in probability, statistical modelling,ML algorithms, and Python Programming. I am also currently studying a course in Deep Reinforcement Learning from IISc Bangalore. I have started writing DS blogs on Medium, participating in Kaggle etc. to quickly fulfil my aspiration as a sincere Data Scientist.  I have just came to know about your channel and I have realised that I have come to the right place for achieving my goal when I heard you explain in one of your videos about  **the reverse engineering approach** which I have missed in my self-learning journey.   I have known what all to study for knowing in and out about the data science BUT being a fresher(no **industry** experience for developing an end to end DS projects) in the DS industry, I do not know how to showcase the level of my skills and knowledge to reserve a good spot in the interviews.   I believe you can provide a guide plan for me me on how should I progress in order to create a good DS profile for getting good DS interview calls and clear one for a candidate like me with any formal education(degrees/industry certificates) in Data Science and past industry experience as a data scientist. For example: Do I need to get AWS certification? How should I build my DS profile? Do I need to do a lot of Kaggle ? Do I need to focus on more NLP/DL projects? Where to get good projects? Is there any learning plan I need to follow in that order? Please Guide!! Thanks a lot. (I am a 2012 IIT graduate, have 2 years of risk analytics experience, 4 years of government sector experience)",True

@vahiagyat,2020-08-26T12:15:46Z,11,"Appreciate the effort guys! In the next 1-2 years, you guys will be the Andrew NG of India! Good luck :)  It's quite surprising to see people being skeptical even for the free courses! Asking about the agenda or what benefit you guys have - As long as I am getting what I want and no one is being harmed, why should I care about your so-called ""hidden agenda"".   Demo classes - I didn't get it, what's the concept of demo classes when the classes are free! Oh, yeah we don't want to waste our time watching something that doesn't worth our time! We will prefer going through our insta/twitter/fb feeds :P   People asking for all the courses: as Sudhanshu suggested, don't spread yourself too thin. Focus on one or two. With experience can grow into the other fields. For a fresher, it's more important to focus on the core first then expand your horizon (for everyone it's different but in general that's a good approach) - obviously, don't be oblivious of the current tech world!",True

I have seen two type of methods to preprocess data and I am confuse which on to choose and which will be good for future projects in ML and DL.  Method 1: (Most of them follow this one)  Handle missing values by using pandas fillna.  EDA  Handle numerical column and do some feature engineering  Handle categorical column by mapping ordinal values and do one hot encoding using pd.get_dummies  Split data and then model building  Method 2:  EDA  Do some feature engineering  import sklearn and create pipelines to impute, encoding and so on.(little complicated)  # Make Transformer  preprocessing = make_column_transformer((make_pipeline(cat_impute,ohe),make_column_selector(dtype_include=object)), (num_impute,make_column_selector(dtype_exclude=object)), remainder='passthrough')  # Make pipeline  pipe = Pipeline([('preprocessing',preprocessing), ('classifier',None)])  I wanted to know best practice which can be use for others such as Deep Learning, etc.",True
