@rezamohammadi3096,2021-01-18T16:23:52Z,1,Hi  @Krish Thanks for amazing tutorial. I'm using k-prototyps library (for mixed numerical and numinal data type) and I want to calculate Silhouette Index to compare my clustering results with previous studies (e.g. k-medoid). Could you please give me a clue to calculate Silhouette Index in my case?,True
@kamilc9286,2021-01-08T16:46:48Z,1,"Sir, if you'll run the number of negative_samples k=4 has 1 (not visible on the chart), so k=2 has score 0,74 and 0 -ve and k=4 has score 0,65 and 1 -ve. Only elbow method suggests k=4.",True

@arjundev4908,2020-08-26T07:07:57Z,33,"So to brief about clustering algorithm..  1. its a unsupervised Machine learning algorithm. 2. To find out number of clusters we use ""Elbow method"". 3. Silhouette(si-lo-wet) scores helps in finding whether the data points in a Clusters formed belongs to respective cluster or not. formula is b-a/max(b,a) where 'a' is distance within the cluster and 'b' is distance between the cluster... if a<b the silhouette scores are positive and is likely that the clustering formed is correct... if a>b and the silhouette scores are negative and highly unlikely that clustering formed is incorrect..    Please add points if missed or correct me if i am wrong..!!",True
