@pnachtwey,2024-05-19T23:28:59Z,0,"All this works fine in theory.  Reality is a bitch.  Right now, I am trying GD with momentum to find the parameter that best fit this equation ""dy2dt = (-(_t0+_t1)*y[1]-y[0]+_k*_u+_c)/(_t0*_t1)"" where k is a gain, t0 and t1 are time constants.  u is a control signal and c is an offset or ambient temperature.  It is not a simple two-dimensional problem.  There are five only five. Yes, the path bounces back and forth.  The derivative for each parameter seems to go positive and then negative.  The problem is finding filter coefficients.  I am very familiar with filters.   For my problem a simple line search seems to work the best.   If going in direction (v0,v1,v2,v3,v4) is good then try n*(v0,v1,v2,v3,v4) until the MSE or SSE isn't decreasing anymore.  About the video.  I could easily take my python program and copy it to jupyter lab.  This way I won't waste time writing on a white board and I could show how changing the momentum number affects the search.   I would start with something simple like a x^2+y2 cone.  Then use the Rosenbrock which is two dimensional but hard for the solvers.   Then I would use my problem with is real data and one would see that in reality things don't work as well the theory claims.",True
