@IvandeAquinoTrigueiro,2023-03-03T13:37:13Z,2,"I managed to make it work, in every way you describe here. But I can't find a way to work when the files are in different folders, not just parent>child. I mean siblings folder. I've read multiple stackoverflow answers but none worked for me and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  Here it goes:   I have a Parent folder. In this folder I have 2 subfolders, let's say: Child1 and Child2. And each subfolder has a .py file. Child1 has my main.py program and Child2 has all the functions.py to make main.py work. So the structure is like this.  Parent/Child1/main.py Parent/Child2/functions.py  I can't for the life of me, make main.py import functions from functions.py.  I've tried ""from ..Parent.Child2.functions import *"". I've tried ""from .Child2.functions import *"". These ones give me ""ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package"" I've tried ""import Parent.Child2.functions"". I""ve tried ""Import Child2.functions"". These ones give me ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Parent'"" and ""ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Child2'""  What am I doing wrong? Yes, I have tried ""__init__.py"" in every folder, no folder, only Child2 folder, only Parent and Child2 folders.",True
