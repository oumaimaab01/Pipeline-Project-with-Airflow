@davidgarmroudi8747,2020-01-28T15:03:36Z,0,"nice video but not perfect! I have question: is it univariate or multivariate? ur out put influenced buy 21 other factors or variable! can u please solve this for electric load signal without any other variables , just demand and time that demand is variying according to the time(univariate I think) can u please explain it for a input time series that output is shifted one? how can I use these methods to reduce the dimension of this type of data? for example 400 load samples according to the time without any exogenous data, and goal is reduce it a vector with 10 features",True

@soumayanmajumder7799,2020-01-24T17:06:38Z,5,"From above we can see that correlation matrix also give correlation between independent features,so it is more helpful than univariate selection. So can you say when we should use univariate selection over correlationmatrix and why ?",True

@SaiPavankumar1,2019-12-15T15:45:54Z,1,Great Video. But I am not sure if Chi square test can be applied between a continuous and categorical variable. In the uni variate analysis chi square was performed between all variables including continuous against categorical target variable,True

@SSNU706,2019-08-25T01:33:16Z,5,"Thanks a lot for all your videos and your efforts. I would like to mention something regarding Covariance and Correlation Coeffiicients @3:25 that you talked about. What you mentioned about Correlation Coeff is correct that it ranges from -1 to 1. However, Covariance is measure of correlation and doesn't vary between 0 & 1  but varies from -inf to +inf and is unit dependent(ie, for ex: covariance of age vs height in cms will be drastically different with age vs height in inches is considered as both of them are in different units) unlike correlation coefficient where the values are standardized and hence it ranges from -1 to 1.",True
