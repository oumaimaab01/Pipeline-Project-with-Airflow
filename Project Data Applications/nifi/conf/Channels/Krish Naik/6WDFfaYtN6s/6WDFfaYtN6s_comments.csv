@anirvansen6591,2019-09-17T03:29:44Z,0,Learnt this new technique.Thanks,True
@niveshtayal979,2019-08-31T17:35:58Z,1,Hi Krish I think this technique is not useful when we are working on real time project. So can you please explain the same with some other technique that will be really helpful.,True
@deepeshkumarsharma6514,2019-08-12T23:40:10Z,0,"sir if you get time please create a video about mean encoding ,  that's also a good technique for encoding",True
@mukulmishra2296,2019-08-12T03:50:22Z,1,can't we use frequency encoding or target encoding?,True
@chowdarybkc1619,2019-08-11T13:26:43Z,3,Bro no jupyter notebook please upload it,True
@datadrix,2019-08-10T20:25:13Z,1,"One stupid question from my side, what the different roles in Machine Learning ? for an example in other fields like developer, tester, coder , etc",True
@abhishekprasad7030,2019-08-10T18:11:33Z,2,"Hello, Can I get to know where are you currently working .. I mean city and Company !!",True
@shaz-z506,2019-08-10T18:00:28Z,4,"Hi Krish, I just have one question, that how we'll decide the top 10 or top 20, the threshold value seems like a tedious way to decide. We'll for threshold value, does that depend upon business and to whatever domain we gonna apply this technique to, please let me know.",True
@HARSHRAJ-2023,2019-08-10T17:35:10Z,2,Can I have GitHub link please for the code used.,True
@vamsireddy6306,2019-08-10T15:43:14Z,1,Sir can we know that one hot encoding with top labels is only way to improve model performance for more labeled datasets. Suppose datasets with 100 labels having same frequency neglecting 90 of 100 labels make our model less efficient.,True
