@aditimondal3995,2022-11-28T04:32:04Z,0,We can see neural network can be of both type as a solution of Adversarial attacks. So the conclusion is neural network can be of both type.,True

@ShashwatAgarwal007,2021-06-23T00:22:12Z,0,Neural Network works on Black Box Model as we can't see what all the calculations are getting done in it. We give some input and get the output.,True

@viralparmar1,2021-06-22T08:07:28Z,3,"Well AI or ML whatever you say was in existence since Geoffrey Hinton. But in those times we were not having enough computational power and at the same time enough data to go ahead and make some inferential models. But today in this 21th century or technological era we are having tremendous amount of computational power, lots of data is getting generated everyday. So technically when you say that Neural networks are complex to visualise the internal workings which apparently makes them a black box thing. I don't agree with that. What makes a Neural network a black box is that people don't care of what's going on inside. All they want is a readymade model and just traing and tune some parameters and that's it. I would rather prefer to say that Neural Network is too a white box .",True
