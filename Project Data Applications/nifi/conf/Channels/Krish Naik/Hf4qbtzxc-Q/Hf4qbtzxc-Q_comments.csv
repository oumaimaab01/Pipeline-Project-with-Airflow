A candidate should be first evaluated based on his/her critical and problem solving approach. Any resource who is strong at maths and critical thinking side can be trained on any r/Python languages or tolls very quickly. Remember tools/languages are only enabler it will not help in structuring the real business problems. These all rest api and and Python implement can be done using small googling but solving a real business problem is an art which comes slowly with time and dedication. Pls ask more business use cases / hypothetical business problems to candidates instead of only focusing on tech or tooling,True
