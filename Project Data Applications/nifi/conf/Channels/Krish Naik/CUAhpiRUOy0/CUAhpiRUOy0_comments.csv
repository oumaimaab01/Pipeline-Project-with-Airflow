After ChatGpt we are still spending time on searching solution almost same that we were doing before chatGpt. It became just another tool that help to search in a better way but at the time of  real problem chatgpt could not understand the problem context    now lets talk about this AI engineer - it provides the integrated environment for development with bug fixing  but at the time of custom development we have to ai instruct on every stage of development also these tools are copying codes from opensource projects they may be less secure or may left the bug or can create the complexity in software that may close the project for adding new features , or may be leave a bug that can't be fixed. If you guys are using coPilot or Codeium you can see these tools also generates codes very quick but i found i had to change those codes 100s of time everyday almost with the every function that these codes build but yes they save a lot of time.   so my conclusion yes its dangerous for new developers because software development will become more faster and required less number of software engineers to work, it will also increase the learning curve because with basic knowledge fresher won't be able to start work in companies because for that they have robots in their companies , Also you can think to  sell your all Indian service based it companies shares in next 5 years they will be nowhere in the industry if they don't create real-world solutions   i don't think ill be witnessed losing my job because of ai in next 10 years because ppl are becoming more stupid all because of AI",True

@user-rb5nd2uv2q,2024-03-14T03:21:26Z,1,"🏀 Inquire of AI what steps to take if one loses their job due to automation replacing human labor.  Losing a job due to automation or AI-driven changes can be challenging, but it's not the end of the road. Here are some steps you might consider taking:  Assess Your Skills and Interests: Take some time to evaluate your skills, interests, and experiences. Identify areas where you excel and consider industries or roles that align with your strengths.  Upskill or Reskill: Consider acquiring new skills or updating existing ones to remain competitive in the job market. Look for online courses, workshops, or certification programs that can enhance your employability.  Explore New Opportunities: Keep an open mind and explore opportunities in emerging industries or sectors that are less susceptible to automation. Research growing fields such as renewable energy, healthcare, or technology, where there may be a demand for skilled workers.  Networking: Reach out to your professional network, including former colleagues, mentors, and industry contacts. Attend networking events, join relevant online communities, and utilize social media platforms like LinkedIn to connect with potential employers or collaborators.  Consider Entrepreneurship: If you have a business idea or a passion project, now might be the time to pursue it. Entrepreneurship allows you to create your own opportunities and potentially build a sustainable income stream.  Seek Support: Don't hesitate to seek support from career counselors, employment agencies, or government programs that offer job placement assistance, training grants, or unemployment benefits.  Stay Resilient and Positive: Job loss can be emotionally challenging, but it's important to stay resilient and maintain a positive outlook. Focus on your strengths, set realistic goals, and celebrate small victories along the way.  Remember that losing a job to automation is often beyond an individual's control, and it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities. By taking proactive steps to adapt and evolve, you can navigate this transition successfully and find new opportunities for growth and fulfillment.",True

@AdityaRaj-kb1uo,2024-03-13T20:16:00Z,1,"I am really really scared about the future of this country. The way people of this country idiolize someone or something is remarkable. Maybe that's because their cultural background has been such that they idiolized gods for their problems and many such things. The impacts of those cultural elements can be seen even today. Based on what I have seen so far, even an entry level java developer will have hard time in getting the proper help from GPT 4, let alone the free version(I have around 50-55 pics of such embarassing encounters). But that difficulty will rarely be discussed because the number of real developers especially at entry level is severely low. I have seen the way Americans write code. They don't bother writting the same code even twice. But the way Indian developers have been involved and are still involved in redundant works in the majority of cases, their future is definitely scary(they can be very easily replaced by AI in the near future). Now, let us take a look at the way you get answers either on Gemini, Perplexity, or ChatGPT (you can refer to the videos of Andres Karpathy for better understanding of it). You get it from a dataset which is the internet in majority of the cases. LLMs can filter out irrelevant things upto some extent but they are terrible in several other things. And once you compare the way human mind creates something and the way LLMs do, you'll know the difference between the potential of human mind and AI. The very quest for making an unbiased AI solution (as in the case of LLMs) is the reason that seems to make these pieces of software unguided upto a considerable extent. And about these CEOs, they'll do no matter how absurd things to gain as much funding as they can. If you people had watched ""The Social Dilema"" when it was released, you'd find it really difficult to believe the words of any silicon valley-based CEO. Any AI based software can work by processing natural language but that AI-based software can't be written in natural language. There will always be a need for good programmers. Based on what the CEO of Nvidia has said about learning to program, I am eagerly waiting for the day when Nvidia will be hiring common people instead of programmers. Programming teaches you a special kind of thinking i.e. computational thinking that can hardly be replaced by AI. That thinking can surely be enhanced by AI but can't be replaced. Unfortunately, the youth of this age are so much confused and distracted that they can consume any information because they lack the ability to think. God bless India.",True
