@viralparmar1,2021-07-16T18:02:53Z,1,"First thing over here is you didn't answered your own question which is "" Are your learning data science in a right wa?"" . All you were talking about applying it which I think is correct when people are having knowledge of  data science at first place. Right now what I feel is, people are not even knowing from where to start. This question which you raised in this video points towards course quality of many institutes who are offering data science courses. I'm not in favour of you neither against you. All I'm saying is people need a "" Getting started Thing"". All I have seen them is learning numpy pandas scipy scikit etc. I think first we should focus on data and analyse it rather then using readymade models and doing tunning.",True
