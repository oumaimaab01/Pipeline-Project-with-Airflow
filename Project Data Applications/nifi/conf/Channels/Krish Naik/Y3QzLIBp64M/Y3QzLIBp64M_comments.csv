I don't understand why you have added, do not reject and reject in the left. In the mentioned example,  Type 1 error occurs when H1 is predicted to be True, but H0 is True. It is the case when predicted that the market is not going to crash, actually it does crash. Type 2 error occurs when H0 is predicted to be True, but H1 is True.

Hence, in case of lack of evidence we will fail to reject null hypothesis and cannot conclude anything. In lines to the judicial example that you have taken, the null hypothesis is that the person is innocent and it is upon the onus of investigating body to prove that the person is guilty, in case they don't have proper evidence to prove that the court/justice system fails to reject the null hypothesis of person being innocent.",True
