@abuyudhistira4129,2021-05-10T15:02:51Z,0,"I want to share my experience which is maybe related with this topic. I have ever learnt item-based collaborative filtering algorithm for machine learning recommender system in pandas dataframe using the famous movielens dataset and it works. Unfortunately on another occasion i have to perform the same algorithm but in big data environment, and pandas cannot work anymore. At the first i write the code using python with so much combination of nested loop. Since i have to deal with 100millions user data, it took 1 day to find recommended product for about 5000 users. Because we want to have recommended products for 100millions in less than 1 day, i change my codes overall to pyspark dataframe with different logic but same algorithm. And it works. Maybe it is one of so much reason why we should have deeper understanding regarding data structures and algorithm.",True
