@eneso8657,2024-02-19T03:27:14Z,0,"Hello, firstly I love your contents. I have an chatbot project and I want him to read both my files and examine my mssql database, follow the instruction I entered in the code and give high-quality answers. It does not examine my pdf, text or Excel files in detail and only gives certain parts of my sources, I want all of my sources to be examined in detail, I want it to be able to answer every question I ask, it does not listen to my instructions completely, I want it to listen better quality and speak as I want, and I have an optimization problem, both the database and the documents should use resources to answer, but if there is no answer in the files, it should switch to the database, but even if the files are not correct, I need a customized mechanism because it gives answers, but it should not be static and it should give answers quickly. By providing these, I want to design a quality chatbot based on RAG with history in the form of q&a. I would like to state that I can connect this code with Aws and use it for public. It would be very nice to use neo4j as a database. As a model, I will use the newly released 4 model and the newly released 3.5 model, I wonder how much you can make this chatbot for me, I have a code I can share as an example. I wish you good work.",True
