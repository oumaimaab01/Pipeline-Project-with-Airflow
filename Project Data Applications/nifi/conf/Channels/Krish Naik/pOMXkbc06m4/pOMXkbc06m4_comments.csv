I have kept NaN values in a dataset, in Integer type columns as well as in String type columns. when I applied df_pyspark.na.drop().show(), it only removed the rows where NaN values are in column of type Integer. Rows having NaN values in string type columns did not get removed. After applying df_pyspark.na.fill('Missing Values').show() , it is not replacing the NaN values with 'Missing Values'. This is the same scenario when I passed single & multiple column names inside fill(). I have also applied the solution provided below by keeping inferSchema = False, but after that also it is not working.
