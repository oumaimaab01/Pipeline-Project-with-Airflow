@sanushaw8643,2021-09-24T07:34:14Z,0,"Hi Krish... I had one query... Here you mentioned that logistic regression is sensitive to outliers but in your theoretical video, you mentioned that it is very good in handling outliers as the cost function is passed through sigmoid function scaling it between 0-1 hence reducing the outlier's impact... Can you please clarify...thanks",True
