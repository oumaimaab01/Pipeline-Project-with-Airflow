@anmolsharma3942,2023-10-09T07:17:51Z,0,can anyone tell me whats the difference betwwen correlation and Mutual Information. what i understood so far correlation compare the  independent features only and MI used to see the relation between depended features. Is that correct ? Thank you,True

@haribattula5187,2022-05-07T12:43:53Z,0,"sir I expected you to implement code from scratch.. But left with lot of confusions how mutual information is calculated between two variables and two features, what the formula behind all those values that we get after applying mutual_info_classif.......",True
@akshaymutalikdesai4370,2022-04-03T20:04:32Z,1,Hi Krish - For a multiclass classification problem i used model_coef method to find the influence of input features on the target variable. How does this method differ from the one you have shown in the video. Which one would be best?,True
@md.younusahamed4969,2022-01-23T03:44:01Z,0,Do we need to apply this SelectKBest in our X_test?,True

@rajeshoo7,2021-10-05T10:36:40Z,0,"Hi sir, whenever I am running this it is taking too much time and not giving any result or any error. Is it because of large data size. No of rows is more than 5 lakhs for my data",True
@arefeshghi,2021-08-22T08:22:29Z,2,"Interesting video, thanks! :)  Just one question: Can we go through the whole data and perform the mutual information gain, and then divide the data into train and test sets? In addition to that, every time I run the code, it returns different values! So, it might be that useful at the end of the day.",True

@vish183,2021-03-02T16:18:08Z,4,"Hey Krish, great content. However, i have a grave concern to share. Why do all Data Science youtubers consider a dataset which has no null or categorical values whilst they touch upon such crucial topics? Main challenge is in understanding how to use various topics when we have heterogenous data.   I guess, you might have good reasons to consider absolutely clean data, but i feel it defeats the purpose when the situation in real world is lot different from whats shown in tutorials.",True
