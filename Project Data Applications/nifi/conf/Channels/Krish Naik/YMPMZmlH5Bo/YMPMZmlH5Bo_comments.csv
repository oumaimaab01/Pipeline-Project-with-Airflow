@MOHITBARTHWAL,2021-10-01T17:20:04Z,0,FIrst of all thanks for bringing such nice video lectures on machine learning. I have Two query regarding down sampling.  1. As we have down sampled the dataset belonging to one class(drastically) will it not result in loss of significant amount of information.  2.And how to decide upto where the downsampling is to be done? as here in the video we downsample the dominant class and made it equivalent to the other one.,True

@ruchitaphalak3603,2021-01-30T12:41:36Z,1,Hello there. Firstly a very big thank you Krish Naik for these videos. A major part of my ML coursework for masters degree was possible almost entirely due to your theory and practical sessions. You are doing such good work. Cant thank you enough. These videos are a big saviour. No kidding but none of my  Masters professors could match your teaching way. Alas! I have to pay so much to the University only to learn from youtube. Thank you once again :),True
@patelajay1010,2021-01-30T00:31:36Z,0,I have one doubt. What if data contains Nan values and you want to do under_sampling? If you impute Nan values with Mean() then there will be information leakage because we impute data before splitting it into train and test dataset. Could you please tell me what should be the possible solution in this case?,True
