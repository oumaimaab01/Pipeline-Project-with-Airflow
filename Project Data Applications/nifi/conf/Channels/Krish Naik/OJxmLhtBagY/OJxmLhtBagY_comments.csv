@abhilashatutube,2020-03-11T06:15:11Z,0,"Hi Krish, I was trying to solve this problem for all possible datasets. However, it looks like this solution may not work for multiple datasets like for example, if I use the following data set: arr = [i for i in range (9999,9965,-1)]; and keep increasing the range by decreasing the second value in the range (9965), the solution would not work for any of these datasets. So would this solution be accepted by the interviewer? Also, do they really expect us to completely solve such problems during the interview? Thanks,",True
