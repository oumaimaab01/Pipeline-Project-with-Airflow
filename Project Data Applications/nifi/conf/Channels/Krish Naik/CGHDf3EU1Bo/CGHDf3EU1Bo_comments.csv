I'm trying to start learning neural networks since 1 year ago, following the steps of Two Minute Papers, then I find this video to try to know how this platform works, I watched this video until the end, and I don't understand what is the final goal for to train a model.

@kvsubbaiahsetty9834,2021-02-18T10:17:27Z,3,"@Krsih Naik,  It is a good tool but when we look at the GitHub repo of Percptilabs,  not much activity happening and no future goals set. There are only two contributors and just 201 stars. So my advice is to think twice before depending on it too much and highly recommending it to others. Just for the sake of comparison, Apache Airflow (Data workflow pipeline) has 20,500 stars with and around 1500 contributors. or you compare it with MLflow, etc, they all create data pipelines or data workflows.",True
