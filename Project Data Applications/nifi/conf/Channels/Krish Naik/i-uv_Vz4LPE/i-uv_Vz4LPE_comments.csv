@deekshithadp9545,2021-07-01T07:00:09Z,1,"Hello Krish,   First of all, Thank you so much for providing very useful content every time. I feel it's worth watching your videos. You make every point very clear; from building to production.  I am having few doubts and I would be glad if you could clear these.  1. How to deploy a saved TensorFlow model into the Google cloud platform using HTTPS protocols and make predictions in the mobile app? Do I have to convert my model into tflite in this case too?  2. I had watched ur Tutorial 6 : Deployment of Machine Learning Models in Google Cloud Platform.       In this, you had used flask API to deploy the model to GCP. Whether this approach is same when it comes to making predictions of images captured on the phone? Or should I convert my model to tflite format?   3. How to read images from URL and use this for prediction in GCP and send the results to the app?  Could you please answer these questions? It would be really helpful if you could help me clarify these doubts.  Thank you very much again!!!! Please keep posting such amazing content always.. More power to you!! Keep growing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",True

@shantya123,2021-03-18T05:10:03Z,0,"Hi Krish, thanks for all you do.  How to save the prediction results from saved model directly into the database to utilize it for data analysis? For example on Titanic dataset, instead of getting prediction on if passenger survived or not I.e. 0/1 for survive Variable. I want to get the score of each passenger and export the prediction results in tabular format along with original dataset. How can I achieve that? Please help",True
