@bubblestyle31,2021-11-25T16:49:28Z,0,"Sir Greetings! I came across an YouTube channel to learn data science and luckily found your channel here, great eye-opener. Will you please guide me in my doubt please 🙏🙏🙏 I've completed BTECH IT by 2016 and didn't learn anything in programming and Don't want to blame anybody on this...I tried joining as intern in many software companies in my hometown but nothing worked for me, because they were dealing with .net and sadly I'm not that good at C language itself. I feel angry over myself for not learning things..and I really wanted to learn something new..please guide me I've two options, block chain or data science or do you have any other suggestions?  I'm even embarrassed while people call me engineer coz I've done nothing. Please guide me on this..I'm being honest and that might definitely sound 😑 I knew..but please do guide me in this.. please..",True
