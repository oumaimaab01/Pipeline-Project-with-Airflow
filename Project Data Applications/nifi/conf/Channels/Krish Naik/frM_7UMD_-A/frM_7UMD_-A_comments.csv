I researched and in my opinion this is not a very good metric for checking accuracy of an anomaly detection system. You didnt explained the Recall which is most important part of this whole video. Apart from that it is more helpful if you explained the ROC and threshhold in this scenario which is what is needed. not just implementation of an algo.

@jammulanarendar9910,2020-10-09T11:21:22Z,5,"Hi Krish , I have a small doubt ,if I observer the Classification report of Isolation forest ,Local  outlier factor and SVM ,The Recall is very less for 1(i.e fraud), can we say the model is accurate only by just looking at the Accuracy (as per my knowledge accuracy is not a good metric for class imbalanced data because let say sample of 100 records having 90:10 Non Fraud : Fraud records even if model blindly say everything is Non Fraud then the accuracy would be 90%.) That's why Kaggle people Recommended to use the AUPR Curve as performance metric for performance check.                                               Thanks in advance.",True

Please be aware of Check frauds, smishing, credit cards frauds and id theft. credit card have always been a target for criminals. But in this age of technological advancements and increases in organized criminal activity, the world is finding it difficult to stay ahead of the fraudsters. Add to this the significant regulations related to the industry and it becomes clear that everyone must maintain constant vigilance in order to detect and prevent credit card fraud and identity theft.  If you've been a victim to online frauds, fraud emergency you may report your case with the FTC online or through Losangelesacfe@gmailcom certified fraud examiners that offers a list of investigation and restitution services for free. The sooner fraud is detected, the lower the financial impact. Often the victim is the first person to discover fraudulent activity. keep an eye on your statements. it's a lot safer when you know what to look out for.",True

As this is a class imbalance data to detect the fraud transaction so accuracy is not the metric that should be counted on. The best recall score you have got is 0.27. I got a recall score for class ""1"" i.e. fraud 0.74.
