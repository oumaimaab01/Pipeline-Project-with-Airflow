@moglimogify,2024-05-23T13:26:04Z,0,"Very good tutorial, clear and easy to follow, thank you :)  Suggestions for future videos: Is there a way to use AWS Bedrock RAG feature programatically? So far I can only find examples of using it in the UI. Im also interested in CrewAI if you want to do a video with integrating it with Bedrock. Id also be interested in a video on how to use different models. Permissions, forming the dictionary in python etc.  Thanks so much.",True

@YashRaithatha1989,2024-03-17T17:35:14Z,4,"Hey Krish  This was a great tutorial and huge thanks for sharing knowledge. Bedrock provides the ability to create knowledge bases for your LLM which can be used in place of FAISS. The knowledge documents can be stored in S3 buckets and can be provided to llms.   Would like to see an end to end example where you make use of all bedrock features (e.g. knowledge bases, agents, etc.) to create a more advanced application where we invoke remote services via bedrock agents, query knowledge basis and the provide everything to llms to get the final response. Happy to collaborate on the same.",True

@vijayragavansk,2024-02-05T21:24:22Z,0,"Hi krish,  Hope you are doing well!  Sorry the below message may be out of context for this particular video but I have no other option to share my experience with ineuron.  I have recently enrolled for Mastering Generative AI with OpenAI, LangChain, and LlamaIndex course in ineuron.  I am already a member of tech neuron. The counsellor I spoke to has informed me that the live class won't be added to tech neuron. So I purchased the GenAl live course again. But when I looked into the induction program video which occurred on Jan 20 you have mentioned people who already have tech neuron access can attend the live classes. I have reached out to the support team both in call & your support system.  If someone raises a query regarding refund or anything at all. The team is supposed to reply to them with a proper solution and should try to explain the terms and conditions by keeping in mind that they are not answering any question paper in an exam and they are dealing with a person on the opposite end who is investing himself in upskilling with his/her hard earned money. The replies which I got from the team are always yes/no type with no proper reasoning.   There is no use of creating so-called ""Support systems"" and marketing them as something revolutionary if the basic essence is not fulfilled which is to solve the query and not to answer/reply for the query.   I have taken the course as a trial with a plan of suggesting ineuron to a wider set of audience but completely dissatisfied with your support team as I believe customer support/experience is equally weighted with the service you are providing(For context, I am working as a data scientist in one of the top 5 pharma companies in US in analysing Customer experience management data)  Been a follower of you from your early days.  Good luck in your future endeavours.  Thanks!",True
