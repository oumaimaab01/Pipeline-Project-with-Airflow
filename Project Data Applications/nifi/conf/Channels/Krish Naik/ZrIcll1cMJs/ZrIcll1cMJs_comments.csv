@srikanthks2841,2023-12-16T11:58:54Z,0,Dear Sir thank you for the videos i would like to understand how we can identify the cross interaction s of parameters. In your example we have considered that each parameter is mutually exclusive. Consider an example of tobacco smoking there are multiple parameters which are corelated either positive or negative how does these algorithms consider the correlation of parameters,True
@vargabghosh5497,2023-03-09T02:28:55Z,0,But using tpot  can I print the values of the hyper parameter  for which our model has best accuracy,True
@mritunjay3723,2023-01-05T17:47:58Z,0,Kuch bhi socho Data Science ya Machine Learning se related ..Krish Sir has already done it  .. and at this time wo karke chhod chuke hain ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,True

@abdelroufelshomakhi6378,2020-11-23T20:10:19Z,0,"Hello krish, thanks alot for your videos, im stuck with training my neural network, but how many times i did tuning it doesnt improve, giving me high bias and high variance in most cases, another question, do u think normalization may affect my data input and respectively my data output, as u may see that the mean and variance change in a datasets so different normalized data so different outputs, am i right or wrong??",True
@souvikghosh6509,2020-09-24T21:54:02Z,1,Is it possible to apply other non-coventional optimization algorithm other than Genetic Algorithm?  Like Particle Swarm Optimization or Harmonic Search Algorithm etc..,True
@sajidchoudhary1165,2020-08-22T09:20:26Z,0,"Sir Please makes video on Mathematics behind on  SVM Regression, AdaBoost Regression, Gradient Boost Classification",True
@jamesmoulds6960,2020-08-06T12:53:01Z,0,"Hi, does anyone know why we might get exactly the same accuracy scores across the different models? For example my manual hyperparameter model actually achieved the joint best accuracy score with my Optuna model.... identical to 16 decimals! Watching Krish move through the tutorials he was achieving a gradual improvement as he went along whereas my model iterations seemed to only move a minute amount? Any ideas?",True
@sid321axn,2020-07-29T05:37:31Z,0,Thanks krish it was a nice demo of hyper parameter tuning,True
