@user-ku3nr4yh7j,2024-03-18T11:36:50Z,0,"ARIMA is working well, the problem is you are training it on difference value which is very small. So it predicting the second difference value. It can rectified by training it on original data with d = 2. I will automatically do two differencing to make it stationary. And original target value will be predicted.",True
