@shilashm5691,2022-02-23T05:59:30Z,2,"MCAR -->> there is no relationship between the observed value and unobserved value. So the missingness is because of random Eg. We are visiting the library and go through the Entry book and we notice there is 5% of missing records. So in this case the 5% missing records can be of any record in the entry book. There is no particular answer why there are missing values. So probablility of missing value is same for all record's in dataset  MNAR --> There is a relationship between missing values and the unobserved values. There is no relationship between observed value and the missing values.. Eg. We are conducting a survey of depression .It is each individual choice to poll so here missing value is depend on the individual who is unknown. So it is MNAR  MAR --> there is a relationship between the observed value and missing values,  not btw unobserved and missing values. And there can also a missingness in subgroup of the observed values. Eg. We are conducting a survey of salary. Here most of the men won't poll and some of women won't poll for salary.. So the missing values of salary has a relatiomln with the gender..   I hope this will clear the doubt. Don't rely on single source, Nobody knows everything, so don't trust anyoneü§£",True
