@dheerajkura5914,2021-03-14T07:45:52Z,1,"This is a good info though..üëç  But, am not sure how github profile creates a value because the business problems and problems which a candidate solved and posted in github is not that relevent, I see some companies are stressing more on github profile to solve their own business problem rather than interview and selecting a candidate ...but I agree the GitHub profile shows the knowledge of candidate on algorithms but not problem solving skills and coming to contribution to open source community that's a personal choice but considering contribution to open source is a criteria is not good choice to select a candidate because I interviewed  candidates who has good GitHub profile but still failed to put their knowledge to understand and solve business problem and the interpretation of the ML results is not at all close because the results from the AI models has to be explainable enough not just having knowledge of algorithms also at every point of feature extraction/feature selection /data cleaning/ sample selection you name it any step  in datascience project business aspects has to be explained by a Candidate ..after all ROI (reduction in time/savings) is needed for business in any AI model  The model maybe basic but stitching the business aspect to the project creates more value   Here, I need to stress a point that knowledge of models and tools are needed above all how the models and tools are used to solve a business problem considering the veracity in the data... that should be the touch point to select a candidate  Let's not  be generic on what the interviewers have been asked because Datascience is more of knowledge based approach rather than tool based approach ...tools are medium to use knowledge for solving business problems because Datascience was in practice before the python /R , Mlops, spark and name many fancy tools....I do agree to cope up with the changing trends but one must understand the core of data, statistics , Statistical Thinking (not applied statistics), problem solving",True
