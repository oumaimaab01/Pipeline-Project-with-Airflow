@vigneshStack,2024-03-28T01:42:15Z,0,"Can anyone explain this K(x,y)=(xT y +c)*d I don't understand this formula means  xT.y becomes x1 square ,x2square, x1x2 but where is the remaining formula means +c and power d",True
@yokeswarans2903,2024-01-26T17:15:18Z,0,I have an doubt if the accuracy was 1.0 then it is termed as overfitting? anyone can explain me,True
@alfonsoortega3022,2023-10-21T23:37:47Z,0,"Hi Krish. Congrats for your great job on clarifying all these difficult concepts... I have a comment on the way in which you decude the components of the linear kernel that will become the new features. You understand x^T y as a mattrix product between x^t (2x1 dimensions) and y (1x2 dimensions) resulting in the 2x2 dimension with the main components. Nevertheless, as far as I know x^T y  should actually be interpreted as a product (scalar) product between a 1x2 mattrix and another 2x1 one resulting in the typical x1y1+x2y2. I have seen in other references that the polynomial kernel is in fact the dth power of the bynomion ( x^T y  + 1) that in fact generates a polynomial whose terms are in fact a linear combination of the components you identify by means of the mattrix production interpretation... At this point, Im not sure if I am right or wrong.... could you clarify, please?",True
