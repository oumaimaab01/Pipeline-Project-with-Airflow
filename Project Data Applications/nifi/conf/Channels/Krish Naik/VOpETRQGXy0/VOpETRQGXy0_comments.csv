@harshlakhani4171,2022-02-25T10:58:22Z,3,"Hi Krish, great video. I just have a follow up question/query:  I want to become a data scientist working in the finance domain (I am not sure which division specifically for now, but I am sure its in the finance space). I know the basics of python for data science (pandas, numpy, etc) and I have done a few projects on kaggle. However, I am going to soon pursue a masters in data science and I am worried about the math. How much math is really required for data science? Intuitively, I understand why statistics plays a big role, but what about linear algebra and calculus? Like, how much of those do you need and what specific topics / learning objectives should you know before you can confidently say they are sufficient? (Sufficient to be a data scientist)  Also - I understand that data science is a huge field and different parts of data science requires different skillsets, but I am looking to be right in between data analysis and machine learning. I am very much interested in machine learning, but then again, i don't want to go too deep into it considering my calculus isn't as strong.   Any advice is much appreciated! Thank you for your time in advance!",True
