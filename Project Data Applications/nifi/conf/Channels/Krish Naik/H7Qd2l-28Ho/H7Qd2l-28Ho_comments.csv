@thetensordude,2023-11-01T21:11:22Z,0,"For those who are learning about boosting, here's the crux.  In boosting, we first build high bias, low  variance (underfitting) models on our dataset, then we compute the error of this model with respect to the output. Now, the second model that we build should approximate the error that we have for our first model.  second_model = first_model  + (optimisation: find a model which minimises the error that the first model makes)  This methodology works because as we keep on building the model the error get's minimised, hence the bias reduces. So, we get a robust model.  Going a bit more in depth, instead of computating the error we compute the pseudo residual because the pseudo residual is proportional to the error, and we can minimise any loss.  So, the model becomes,  model_m = model_at_(m-1) + learning_rate * [derivative of the loss function with respect to model_at_(m-1)]",True

@shilashm5691,2022-02-07T09:20:41Z,1,There is no such term weak learner in whole boosting.. We only use the term weak learning in adaboost.. Because it creates a stumps instead of trees. Stump is like when you have an decision tree with root and two or more leaves.. In that time it can't able to predict very well.. So we will combine those weak learners to make it strong learners,True
@sushantkumartisapresident,2021-02-05T20:06:28Z,13,Honest feedback for Arslan and many such freshers - Kindly focus and work on your communication skill as well. Many of you will get rejected if you are not able to communicate well,True

And genuinely want to make their career into Data Science!! Sir please, please make a video on this topic Sir could you please make a video again on Top PGDBA or Mba in business Analytics colleges in india and top Msc Data science/Big Data Analytics colleges in India",True
@phanindraparashar8930,2021-02-04T20:57:09Z,38,"Asume u r in class 12 and preparing for JEE Mains. U are an excellent student of Mathematics and Physics but u barely understand chemistry. If Boosting algorithm is ur teacher, it ensures that u get more class of chemistry so that u focus on the areas where u are weak. This is exactly what boosting does in a laym man terms. It ensures that u see more samples of data which u are predicting badly so that ur performance in those areas increase and thus u get a better score. It also has some regularisation effect inbuild thus reducing over fitting also to some extent.",True
