@EvaPev,2023-11-06T02:59:35Z,0,"fit_transform() and transform() are both included in PloynomialFeatures for reasons of uniformity throughout scikit-learn. In the particular case of PolynomialFeatrues, there is not much distinction between the two since no data is being ""fitted"" to anything. The method only takes your features and provides the relevant squares, cubes etc (and the cross terms if more than one feature) - so it just gives you back your ""a"" and calculates a^0, a^2, a^3 etc whatever degree you specified (and respectively b^0, b^1, b^2, b^3 and ab, ab^2, a^2b etc etc). There is no fitting. The fitting exists in the LinearRegression for example where the algorithm computes the mean and standard diviation from the train set. THAT is what you don't want to recalculate with the test set. But for the PolyFeatures, there is no distinction, no training or fitting to talk about. It just calculates some powers and puts them neatly in a format (array) that you can use for your regression for example. ETA: Well actaully there is a differnece in terms of comoputational time. As fit() determins the number and type of features to be returned (like a, a^2 for degree 2 for example) and transform applies this to your input. So once you determine this with fit_transform, transform will apply it without redetermining. But there is no difference in the output between the two and will not introduce data leakage if you use fit_transform() to the test set.",True
