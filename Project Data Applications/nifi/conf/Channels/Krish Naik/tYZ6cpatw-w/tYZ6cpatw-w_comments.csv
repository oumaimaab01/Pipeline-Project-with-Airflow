@aashishraina2831,2020-08-09T08:43:41Z,0,"simple question:   You said when we have imbalanced data set , we cannot always go for accuracy, we have to consider precision or recall to judge the accuracy.  Now  the above final matrix which we have how can we find accuracy here, is it the F1 score we should consider, but there are 3 classes. I am a little confused here",True

@charlsjoseph,2020-05-03T14:32:21Z,1,"It looks like FP and FN are interchanged. Sir, I'm confused as your previous video on binary classifier performance metrics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWAnNHXIKww&t=1018s    shows differently.  Also  didn't understand the precision calculation for cat. it should be row wise not column wise addition on denominator right ?  My understanding on precision is Out of total positively predicted cats, how many are actually cat",True
