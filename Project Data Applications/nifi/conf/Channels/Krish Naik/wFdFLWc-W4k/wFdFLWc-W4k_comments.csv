Lately I've been watching your videos on GenAi and I'm so glad that someone is putting up content on actually using these openly available models for real world use cases! However I would like to see more and more videos on domain specific fine tuning! Ive practically seen domain specifically fine tuned models with around 200M, 300M parameters generating results far better than generic models like Gemini, GPT3.5 turbo etc which are huge! I'm looking forward to a full length video from you on actually fine tuning smaller LLMs like T5 (base/small openly available) for domain specific tasks like text2sql and benchmark those scores with the results produced in this video!! Lighter models and more accurate results are always exciting to watch!",True
