@munafdamani6233,2021-01-21T10:35:26Z,0,"Sir, Thank you for the wonderful information. Que: I have a 4 dependent variables and 1 independent variables. Those 4 dependent variables have the same units. All 5 variables are giving some values at every 5 minutes of interval from the live market. Now I want to normalize those 4 dependent variables and then I want to derive one score from them. How can I do these? How can I normalize these live data? Those 4 dependent variables have wide range also like -1, 12435, 435, 0.6. Please give solution.",True
