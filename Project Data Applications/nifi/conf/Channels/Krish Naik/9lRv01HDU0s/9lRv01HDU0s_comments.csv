@prateekcaire4193,2024-02-04T19:24:41Z,0,maybe higher slope has low variance across all data set points including unknown test and validation datasets. why would we like to penalize the higher slope.

@taruchitgoyal3735,2024-02-01T10:49:38Z,0,"Hello Sir, As I understand, we apply Regularization [Ridge and Lasso] to reduce features or reduce contribution of features. As you also shared we took sum of squared residuals and then added the regularization constant to it.  Thus, we get cost value which is equal to sum of squared residuals and regularization penalty and we get a numerical result as the output of the computation. At this point, How do we perform the feature selection or control contribution of each input variable in feature space? Thank you",True

@user-eb3th4hb3d,2024-01-05T14:39:07Z,0,"What if so as to reduce overfitting I'll need to increase the steepness rather than decreasing it (We can't even have Lambda as a negative integer, then how can we fix it)?",True

@nano7586,2023-09-27T15:15:24Z,0,"I'm confused. But what if the testing data is actually higher than the training data. In that case, wouldn't a steeper slope be beneficial? Would you then just put a ""-"" (minus) in front of your ridge regression term of the loss function?",True
@nano7586,2023-09-27T15:02:36Z,0,"So regularization is only helpful when your sample size is low, right? Are there any drawbacks when applying regularization for a high sample size dataset? Will it introduce a bias? I'm an engineer and to be honest, regularization to me sounds like you're manipulating your data and basically adjusting the regression manually. If the linear regression model was a rope then that would mean rotating that rope clock- or counterclockwise. I don't feel super confident using any of these techniques because I can't explain what exactly I've done. My superiors will ask me what I've done and I'll be able to explain what this means technically, but I won't be able to justify it. Are my worries justified?",True
@user-cy9zf4oz2i,2023-09-22T02:20:11Z,0,"i think you need to emphasize on the high variance toward the test data, and low variance toward the training data, the problem with overfitting is that this low variance on the training data comes at the expense of high variance on the test data. When the model is exposed to new, unseen data (the test data), it struggles to generalize because it has essentially memorized the noise and intricacies of the training data. This results in a significant difference between the model's predictions and the true values on the test data, indicating high variance on the test data.",True

@suman.michael,2023-06-20T07:48:39Z,0,"Great work Krish @krishnaik06 ...!   Just curious, How do we relate overfitting in linear regression to high slope?  Consider a simple scenario, A model got ""overfitted"" to the the training distribution with slope 1. What if the test distribution lies above the line such a way that a higher slope (>1) would predict the test distribution much better.  Putting it again, The model is overfitted (memorised the train data with slope 1). The core idea of Regularisation (at least what's discussed here) is to bring down the slope value by penalising it, Right? So, How do I increase the slope and generalise it with these Regularisation techniques?   Could a lambda < 0 work here?",True

@ling6701,2022-09-22T19:30:19Z,0,"Thanks. Very well explained (I needed this). I have a question though. For ridge regression, we're trying to penalize steep slopes. Ok, but why is that ? Why don't we try to penalize flat slopes instead (imagine the flat slope is flat, and the real data points are above the best fit line, so that there is still overfitting)? I mean: don't we want to penalize any type of difference between the actual data points and the best fit line? Why only penalize the difference in one direction?",True

The opposite of what you explained - training data provides an overfitting condition, however, the slope is nearly horizontal (slope is ~0), whereas the test data points are much above the slope. Penalizing the slope won't help in this scenario. 2. Training data as well as test data have high slopes - in such a scenario, penalizing a slope by Ridge/Lasso regression would result in an inappropriate model.

@ibrahimibrahim6735,2021-01-10T01:44:51Z,0,"Thanks, Krish,   I want to correct one thing here, the motivation behind the penalty is not to change the slop; it is to reduce the model's complexity.   For example, consider the flowing tow models: f1:  x + y + z + 2*x^2 + 5y^2 + z^2 =10 f2: 2*x^2 + 5y^2 + z^2 =15  f1 is more complicated than f2. Clearly, a complicated model has a higher chance of overfitting.     By increasing lambda (the complexity factor), it is more likely to have a simpler model.   Another example:  f1: x + 2y + 10z + 5h + 30g = 100 f2: 10z + 30g = 120  f2 is simpler than f1. If both models have the same performance on the training data, we would like to use f2 as our model. Because it is a simpler model and a simpler model has less chance for overfitting.",True

@Sumta555,2020-05-27T04:46:04Z,5,18:35 How the features get removed where |slope| is very very less? Hats off for this fantastic clarity on the topic.,True
@chavianddavid,2020-05-22T05:29:20Z,0,"If you are always adjusting the training model until it results in the best model for the test data, why isn't that the same as just creating a model from the test data?",True
@habilmohammed5127,2020-05-21T23:17:02Z,1,"Good video on ridge and lasso..  Just a clarification, if our variables are indeed highly correlated in general, wouldn't performing these techniques increase the errors on test data as well.",True

@arunxavier502,2020-05-21T01:18:08Z,0,Hi...in this video..u always mention that Ridge regression is trying to penalise lines with higher slope..but what if in the test data the points are on the left side of the steep slope line...i.e. the slop still need to be steeper for best fit line?,True
@shakyasarkar7143,2020-05-19T22:17:50Z,1,"Sir, you are a pure genius in explaining concepts. I follow almost all your ML topics.  But one thing that's constantly creating clouds of questions is that, how are the features exactly getting eliminated..you said that the slope for those features will get to zero..but that will also happen for the other features also right?  If the  penalty i.e: λ(|w_1|+|w_2|+|w_3|+...|w_N|) is getting zero, then all the slopes for those features will be also getting zero right?  Can you please give me a detailed explanation, Sir?  I am a huge fan of your playlists and your explanations. And I am working very hard to get these ML concepts crisp and crystal clear. Please help me out with this Sir.  You can also suggest me some articles if needed..but please make me understand this, Sir.  Thank you.",True

@alexjohnston6847,2020-05-03T21:28:06Z,0,"At 18:00, you are writing lambda * |m1 + m2 + m3 + m4|... but shouldn't it be lambda * (|m1| + |m2| + |m3| + |m4|...)? Otherwise, the individual slopes could partially or entirely cancel eachother out. Say if m1 = +2, m2 = -2, m3 = +1, m4 = -1, then the |sum(all slopes)| = 0, but sum(|each individual slope|) = 6.",True
@sahilzele2142,2020-05-02T12:04:50Z,11,"so the basic idea is:   1)steeper slope leads to overfitting @8:16 (what he basically means is that the overfitting line we have has a steeper slope which does not justify his statement on the contrary)     2)adding lambda*(slope)^2 will increase the value of cost function for the overfitted line, which will lead to reduction of slopes or 'thetas' or m's (there are all the same things) @10:03   3)now that the value of cost function for overfitted line is not minimum, another best line is selected by reducing the slopes or 'thetas' or m's which will also reflect in addition of lambda*(slope)^2 ,just this time slope added will be less. @13:45    4)doing this will overcome overfitting as the new best fit line will have less variance(more successful for training data) and less bias than our previous line @14:10 , the bias maybe more because it was 0 for overfitted line ,then it will be a bit more for the new line   5)lambda can be also called as scaling factor or inflation rate to manipulate the regularization. as for the question ,what happens if we have overfitted line with less steeper slope?,  then i think we'll find the best fit line with even less steep slope(maybe close to slope~0 but !=0) @16:30   and tadaa!!!! we have reduced overfititng successfully!! please correct me if anything's wrong",True
