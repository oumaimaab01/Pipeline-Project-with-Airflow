@neelanshuchoudhary536,2019-12-29T17:15:00Z,1,"very nice explanation,,great :)",True
@bhavikdudhrejiya4478,2019-12-06T14:54:42Z,0,"Very nice way to explain. Learned from this video-  1. Getting the error (Actual Output - Model Output)^2 2. Now We have to reduce an error i.e Backpropagation, We have to find a new weight or a new variable  3.  Finding New Weight = Old weight  x Changes in the weight 4. Change in the Weight = Learning rate x d(error / old weight) 5. After getting a new weight is as equals to old weight due to derivate of Sigmoid ranging between 0 to 0.25 so there is no update in a new weight 6. This is a vanishing gradient",True
@anandemani5472,2019-11-22T11:51:53Z,0,"Hi Krish,Can we declare convergence when the weights are decreasing less than 0.0001?",True
@kamal6762,2019-11-13T20:34:15Z,0,In this particular case if we take the Learning rate value very less like about .001 then the weights difference is going to very less.,True
