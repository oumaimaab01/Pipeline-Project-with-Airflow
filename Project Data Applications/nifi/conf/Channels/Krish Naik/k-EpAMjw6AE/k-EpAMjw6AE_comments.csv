@manojrangera5955,2021-08-29T17:15:52Z,0,"Sir, i have a question... In individual video you do train test split and compute feature selection technique on xtrain and  Then remove correlated feature from xtrain and xtest also.. Sometimes you don't do train test split and direct use df fir feature selection.. So i am confused.. Should i need to do train test split and then after calculate feature selection process or just use df for it... Please reply  Sir.. I am so much confused in this... If anyone knows the answer then reply also ... Thanx in advanced.. üôèüôèüôè",True
