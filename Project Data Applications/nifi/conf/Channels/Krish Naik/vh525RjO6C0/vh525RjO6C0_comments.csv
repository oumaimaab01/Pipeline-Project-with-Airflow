@styles4330,2024-02-09T14:19:25Z,0,"Here are the functions mentioned in the video with examples:  * Creating arrays:   * `np.array()`: This function is used to create arrays from various data types like lists, tuples, etc. For example, `np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` creates a one-dimensional array with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.   * `np.zeros()`: This function creates an array filled with zeros. For example, `np.zeros((3, 4))` creates a two-dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns, all filled with zeros.   * `np.ones()`: This function creates an array filled with ones. For example, `np.ones((2, 2))` creates a two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 2 columns, all filled with ones.   * `np.random.rand()`: This function creates an array filled with random floats between 0 and 1. For example, `np.random.rand(2, 3)` creates a two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 3 columns, filled with random floats between 0 and 1.   * `np.random.randn()`: This function creates an array filled with random samples from the standard normal distribution. For example, `np.random.randn(3, 3)` creates a two-dimensional array with 3 rows and 3 columns, filled with random samples from the standard normal distribution.  * Indexing and slicing:   * `[]`: This operator is used to access elements of an array. For example, `arr[0]` accesses the first element of the array `arr`.   * `[:, :]`: This is used to access all elements of an array. For example, `arr[:, :]` accesses all elements of the array `arr`.   * `[start:stop:step]`: This is used to slice an array. For example, `arr[1:4:2]` selects elements from index 1 to index 4 (excluding index 4) with a step of 2.  * Mathematical operations:   * `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`: These operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations on arrays element-wise. For example, `arr1 + arr2` adds the corresponding elements of arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.   * `x * arr`: This multiplies each element of the array `arr` by the scalar `x`.   * `arr.shape`: This attribute returns the shape of the array as a tuple of integers. For example, `arr.shape` might return `(3, 4)`, indicating that the array has 3 rows and 4 columns.  * Reshaping:   * `np.reshape()`: This function is used to reshape an array into a new shape. For example, `np.reshape(arr, (2, 6))` reshapes the array `arr` into a two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 6 columns.  * Other functions:   * `np.dot()`: This function is used to perform dot product or matrix multiplication between arrays.   * `np.sum()`: This function is used to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.   * `np.mean()`: This function is used to calculate the mean of all elements in an array.  These are just a few of the many functions available in NumPy. I hope this helps!                                                                                                        -courtesy:GeminiAI",True
