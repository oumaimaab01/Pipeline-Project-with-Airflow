@maskman9630,2022-09-28T04:08:27Z,0,how to drop the columns based on those f and p values if we have more columns....?,True
@sarvatra539,2022-07-09T21:34:34Z,0,"Wonderful explanation. What happens if your dependent variable (Here Survived is having only two values: 0 or 1) was also categorical with more than 2 values?  How do you identify the features to drop? How do you perform the analysis of the odds of the independent variables associated with that dependent variable? Logistic Regression with multi-class?   Do you have a use case or example of a scenario where all your dependent and independent variables are categorical?  what type of test can be done to determine the odds of the output variables on the given input features?  Specifically target variable is having more than 2 values?",True

@utkarshsharma1867,2022-05-10T10:58:17Z,0,You sort P_values in descending order at 20.12 n you say lesser p value's feature is important.So according to this alone must be the important feature?,True
@ajaykushwaha-je6mw,2022-05-06T18:28:20Z,1,there is minor mistake in code. correct code is : p_values.sort_values(ascending=True),True
@abdelouadoudkhouri8234,2022-05-03T22:00:40Z,0,"great video brother, but how about this : instead of encoding columns that already  has binary variables (like sex,alone,survived), supposing  we have some categorical  features (after encoding them) that carries more than one column for each, it happens when a certain column has more than 2 variables.  in this case and by considering nominal variables, instead of having one Pvalue for each feature we might have 3 Pvalues or more for a single feature. question : what should i do in this situation ? i wish you best luck brother",True

@yashasvibhatt1951,2021-09-26T16:19:52Z,30,"Hello everyone, here's something that has been done wrong in this video, I am pretty much sure Krish might have done that by mistake. In the last part where you do the sorting thing, in between 18:38 - 21:00, that step is not sorting the columns based on their associated p-values instead it is sorting them based on their names, i.e 'Sex' is coming before 'Embarked' even though the p-value for 'Embarked' is greater than 'Sex', and that is why you are receiving randomly sorted results when you see the decimal converted p-values. To fix this or sort that Series object on the basis of their respective p-values use p_values.sort_values(ascending=False) instead of p_values.sort_index(ascending=False), now you are generating results on the basis of sorted p-values, which should be correct imo. Hope that helps!",True
