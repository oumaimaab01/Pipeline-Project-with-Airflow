@vahiagyat,2021-06-24T13:30:45Z,0,"This is the perfect example if you want to do something, you find out a way to do the same. And also, how it's easier to switch/transition within the company compared to doing transition and switching company at the same time. We developed similar and many more such use cases for customers and also integrated with Salesforce, Zendesk, Zoho, Jira etc.  But always remember, if you are not from data science and you come up with such a use case on your own and do a PoC - it always adds much more value compared to someone who is already in the DS and does this project. Why? Because it shows your curiosity, learning, and hard-working nature. And by implementing you are already demonstrating you can handle ownership. **Always try to implement - if you go in an interview or even in your company if you just pitch an idea - you may not get much traction from the people (unless and until you are CXOs or VP kinda thing). As a product manager that's how I pitch my stretch goal use cases to my CTO...do a quick PoC showing yes the idea is doable..then proper Data Engineers/scientists sit and refine it and make it a deployable product :)",True
