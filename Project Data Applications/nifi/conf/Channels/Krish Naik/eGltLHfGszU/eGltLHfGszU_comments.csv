@apurva1589,2023-04-06T11:42:37Z,0,"Would you recommend a software engineer/BA grad or any XYZ  grad to build a BRIDGE/HIGHWAY or CAR after a course/youtube of 6 months?  There is a niche in work. Just because IT has money/demand doesn't mean every Tom, Divk and harry should be doing it and should be hired. This has created unnecessary competiton as well. I worked and interview people, I see they haven't even knowlede of basics and they have spent 5+ years in industry, coz survival is easy for many in corporate, even if unskilled, if they know politics, form groups, play W card.  People who come from no background or knowledge in the field, lead you and even are managers. This is how it works in India.",True
