The questions are being answered in a jiffy and the problems are being resolved quickly. 👌👌👌 Coming back to the Data Science Architecture course, there are few terms of Data Science which are frequently used, which is completely new for a beginner. I think most will understand, but it's a bit difficult for me to understand. I know it's difficult to make everyone understand in such a short time. Otherwise, I understood the rest of the DSAR course and other courses as well. Just a suggestion from my side. Kudos to the team for this awesome gesture.👍👍✌️",True
