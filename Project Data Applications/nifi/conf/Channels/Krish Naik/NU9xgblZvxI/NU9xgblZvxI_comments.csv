@sashsrivastava5481,2019-11-05T23:31:17Z,3,"Hi Krish,  I watch a lot of your videos. They are informative and very nice.  I am hoping you can help with this query. I live in Dublin and work in the hotels industry. I face a lot of problems which I believe data scientists can solve. Example- gathering data from booking.com reviews and ascertaining the areas of improvement.  I am not skilled enough (yet) to handle the complete life cycle of data science. Although I think I know the answer (because I directly face those issues). However, I need data to support it.   Can you advise me how and where I can hire freelance data scientists/analysts who can help me.  I wish to present the reports to senior management.  Thank you so much in anticipation.  (If possible make a video, I really admire your talent of explaining such complicated concepts in simple, understandable language) Cheers!",True
