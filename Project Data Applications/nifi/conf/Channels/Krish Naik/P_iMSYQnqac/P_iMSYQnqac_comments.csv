@Ro45256,2024-03-09T23:33:49Z,1,"Krish, I have one doubt. You are saying that we need to compute the null values by considering the other releted columns. Then tell me how we can implement the same as a pipeline(sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline) so that the pipeline can be used to compute the missing values of the test dataset.  Please clear my doubt if anybody knows! It will be helpful for me.....",True

@channelfisikaasik1124,2022-05-16T06:35:59Z,0,"Well, I appreciate the video that Mr.  krish naik made and i love to see his videos and I really want to discuss on how can we handle missing values. Ok well using separate model to see relation between variables that have complete dataset is not great though because the value, since it's a value generated from machine learning, is not a real data and may statistically far from central of population data because it comes from other equation. I would love to use statistical method like mean, median or mode and, I don't know this will work or not, checking the range of population mean and make sure that the value is not going far from population mean",True

@radifantaufik8085,2021-02-23T13:46:08Z,4,"I think there is a quantitative justification why we should fill the NaN values on 'Age' with median that classified by 'Sex' and 'Pclass'. On EDA step, we can print or visualize heatmap of the correlations between each columns (dataset.corr().abs()). We can see that 'Age' columns has relatively high correlation to 'Sex' and 'Pclass' columns.",True

@ankitvarma2319,2020-07-11T19:30:09Z,0,Sir I have a doubt in this. What is we have 50 Pclass values it become really tedious to write all of them. Is there any way we can use list of such pclass values while using the list of the potential age list while defining the function. For ex If Pclass == list1:                                                       return age ==list2,True

@priyaranjanswainjitu,2020-05-04T16:54:16Z,0,"Hi Krish , I have one doubt on this case study . Why you have imputed on basis of class column ? We can also do it on basis of  Gender column as well .
