@vivekjohari2001,2022-08-06T15:36:02Z,0,"Krish - I like your videos especially because of your expertise in content and command of the flow of the videos. However, It would be great if you could slow down while speaking so that people can easily understand what you're trying to say. Just consciously try to speak a bit slower and don't rush through it - you'd do great!",True

@oyedeepak,2021-06-04T17:27:49Z,7,"Hi, here I can see that models are being combined to get the predictions. But. what if I get better results with RF Classification alone than the combination? Should I got with RF?",True
@shubhamnehete8020,2021-05-26T16:47:56Z,2,"Hello Krish, I just wanted to ask that why the random forest, knn algorithm is used here.

@niveditaparab6772,2020-12-19T23:11:32Z,0,lovely i used to print whole classifiction matrics other way i used to do is  is to print the histogram of predicted probablity and roughly see where can you get good gap between 2 classes  your way is way better,True
