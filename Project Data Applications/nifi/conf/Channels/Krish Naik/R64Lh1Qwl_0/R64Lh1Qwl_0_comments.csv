@palvinderbhatia3941,2023-10-13T13:47:43Z,0,"Easy and Simple video to understand Recommendation System. Thanks for all the efforts. Doubt: 1. Any intuition behind filtering #ratings > 100, I mean why 100? 2. Can we apply filter on correlation and sort why #ratings? if yes, how to choose correct value for correlation? 3. Does the correlation only consider wether rating is given by similar user (Yes/No) or it also consider what rating is given (0-5).  Bcz lets say User A watched and rated Movie b -> 2.5 rating, Movie C -> 1.5 rating.  This indicates that user A watched these movies but do not like them.  So if correlation only consider wether rating is given or not in that case user X might get recommendations (similar to User A i.e Movie B,C) and he may not like them.",True
