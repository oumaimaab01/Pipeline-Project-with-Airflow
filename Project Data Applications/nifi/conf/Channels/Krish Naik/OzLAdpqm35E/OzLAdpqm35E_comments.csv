@siddheshmirjankar910,2024-04-02T22:07:33Z,0,"Hi Krish! Do you have a video explaining how one can use the Keras tuner with a pre-trained model? I am currently working on a drug classification project using MobileNet. I am not able to go above a test accuracy of 85%. Also, when I try to predict an image that is input by the user,  the prediction is incorrect a lot of the times. Hence, I was wondering if I can use the keras tuner to fine tune the MobileNet to get a better accuracy. Is it possible?",True

So I looked at my code, and copied the same model.. 4 minutes on a Titan.. mmm ..After hours of searching for the cause, I discovered it was coming from the ImageDataGenerator that is slow as hell !  If I don't use a flow from dataframe.. hard to get an epoch of more than 30s. If I put a simple shear, or any transformation in an ImageDatagenerator: 4minutes !  But then how can I do transfer learning, like VGG16 that has a preprocess function (so my epochs are of 4minutes !) If I remove the preprocess ? few secs per epoch",True
