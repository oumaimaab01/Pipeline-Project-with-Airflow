So I did some research most articles they referred as High bias and low Variance  for underfittings but I guess  you can call it underfitting for both high bias and high variance too.  in Summary: **Overfitting: Good performance on the training data, poor generalization to other data.(Low Bias, High Variance)**  **Underfitting: Poor performance on the training data and poor generalization to other data.(High Bias, High Variance)or(High Bias, Low Variance)**",True

@Aaronisification,2021-05-04T00:46:57Z,1,"BIAS pertains to the training set's performance,  VARIANCE pertains to the test set's performance.   **For regressions:**  1. Polynomial of 1 - simple. linear. regression. the example shows how the training points *underfit* the line, as the R^2 will be high . high variance   high bias   2. polynomial of 2 - slight curved regression. The regression line fits the data better than example 1, and not too much.  low variance low bias  3.  polynomial of 4 - curved regression. the line is fit precisely, *overfitting* the data.  high variance (on the test set) low bias (on the training data)  BOTH UNDERFITTED / OVERFITTED MODELS PRODUCE HIGH RATES OF ERROR.   **For Classification:**  1. Model 1: an *overfit* Training error - 1% - Low Bias Test error - 20%  - High Variance  2. Model 2: an *underfit* training error: 25% - high bias Test error: 26% - high variance  3.  Model 3: a *well fitted* model training error: <10% - low bias test error: <10% - low variance  **GRAPHING THE ERROR as a FUNCTION of DEGREE of POLYNOMIAL: Y = Error X = Polynomial Degree *Training Error [red] / Cross-Validation (Test) Error [blue]  * 1. For the *underfitting* condition:     - BOTH the training (bias) error and test (variance) error will be high.     2. For the *overfitting* condition:     - the training (bias - red) error rate will drop as the polynomial degree increases *from 1 to 4*     - the test (variance - blue) error rate will drop to a vertex where polynomial degree increases *from 1 to 2* yet will rebound back up as it goes from *2 to 4*    - the resulting low bias, high variance causes an overfit condition.   3. The fitted condition :    - achieving the balance of lowest training (bias - red) error and lowest test (variance - blue) error rates on the chart provided.     - in this example, polynomial regression of degree 2 was the best fit.   For DECISION TREES:  - a decision tree with no cap on depth will OVERFIT the model.  - the training set will be fit with every possible split, leading to a low bias error.  - the test set will subsequently produce higher rates of variance error.  - setting the max_depth parameter on a decision tree is critical to finding the right balance.   For RANDOM FOREST:  - please check my understanding here:  - will begin with a LOW BIAS / HIGH VARIANCE like the Decision Tree.   - a random forest model is a **bootstrap aggregation**   - _bootstrap aggregation_ works by feeding subsets of the training set to members of a *set of decision tree* models.  - their outputs in turn are weighted, contribute to a more balanced classification, leading to LOW VARIANCE test  errors.",True

Variance is the complexity of a model that can capture the internal distribution of the data points in the training set. When variance is high, the model will be fitted to most (even all) of the traiining data points. It will result in high training accruacy and low test accuracy.   So in summary :   When the model is overfitted : Low bias and high variance When the model is underfitted :High bias and Low variance   Bias : The INABILITY of the model to be fit on the training data Variance : The complexity of the model which helps the model to fit with the training data.",True

Why I should be concerned about, underfitting scenarios in regression or classification model ? As far as my train data does not fits in best fit line, I would not go to test the model on my test data, I would stop if the train data does not fit at very first level, so does it mean I will be always taking care of overfitting scenarios ? coz if the train model fits well on best fit line, I should be naturally skeptical whether it is going to be fit for train model or not. On the other hand, in case of low bia scenarios at first only, I would rather tweak my modeling parameter than try it over on training model.  secondly, is it possible to have high bias and low variance scenario ? coz naturally, I would not check the model on my training data, it at first place I am getting a high bias scenario ? so what practice should one conduct, does it mean, even if you dont get good results on your training model, you should run your model on test data?  It does not sound good..  Please help me with this query.",True

If the error between the training and the test set is not drastically different, it may not be a result of high bias and high variance. In the real world scenario, we are unlikely to get a very high accuracy i.e >90%. I would consider a high bias and high variance prob as for example - Training acc - 75% and Test acc - 65%. What do you think?",True
@heartsbrohi9394,2020-09-23T13:58:16Z,183,"Good turorial. My thoughts below (hope it adds to someone's understanding):  We perform cross validation (to make sure that model has good accuracy rate and it can be used for prediction using unseen/new or test data). To do so, we use train and test data by properly splitting our dataset for example 80% for training, 20% for testing the model. This can be performed using train_test, train_test_split or K-fold (K-fold is mostly used to avoid under and overfiting problems).  A model is considered as a good model when it gives high accuracy using training as well as testing data. Good accuracy on test data means, model will have good accuracy when it is trying to make predictions on new or unseen data for example, using the data which is not included in the training set.  Good accuracy also means that the value predicted by the model will be very much close to the actual value.   Bias will be low and variance will be high when model performs well on the training data but performs bad or poorly on the test data. High variance means the model cannot generalize to new or unseen data. (This is the case of overfiting)  If the model performs poorly (means less accurate and cannot generalize) on both training data and test data, it means it has high bias and high variance. (This is the case of underfiting)  If model performs well on both test and training data. Performs  well meaning, predictions are close to actual values for unseens data so accuracy will be high. In this case, bias will be low and variance will also be low.  The best model must have low bias (low error rate on training data) and low variance (can generalize and has low error rate on new or test data).   (This is the case for best fit model) so always have low bias and low variance for your models.",True

@westrahman,2020-06-24T09:28:20Z,22,"XGBoost, the answer cant be simple, but what happens is when dealing with high bias, do better feature engineering n decrease regularization, so in XGBoost we increase depth of each tree and other techniques to handle it to minimize the loss...so you can come to conclusion that if proper parameters are defined (including regularization etc) it ll yield low bias and low variance",True

@devasheeshvaid9057,2020-05-14T12:31:45Z,4,"Hi @Krish I read the following in a resource: ""Bias refers to the gap between the value predicted by your model and the actual value of the data. In the case of high bias, your predictions are likely to be skewed in a particular direction away from the actual values.   Variance describes how scattered your predicted values are in relation to each other.""  This doesn't imply bias as the training data error and variance as the test data error. Am I missing any point here? Please elaborate.",True
