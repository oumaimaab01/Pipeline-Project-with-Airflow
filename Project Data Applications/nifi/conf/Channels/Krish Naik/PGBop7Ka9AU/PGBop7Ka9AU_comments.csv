@malusisibiya3330,2020-11-27T01:00:30Z,25,"You forgot to mention that the strides may also have an effect. Your example is true if the stride is 1.If the stride was to be 2 for instance,  things would change. Use the formula;    Dimensions = [(input image size-Filter size+ 2*Padding size)/stride size         + 1].     In your last example with the stride of 1 and padding of 1 as you only have one layer of 0's surrounding your original image,the solution is worked out as follows:                                               Dimensions  =  [ (8-3) + 2 * 1)/1      +   1]                                                                                                                                        = 8                 Therefore   the feature map has dimensions of 8 * 8",True
