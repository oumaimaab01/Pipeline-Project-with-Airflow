@ShukyPersky,2022-12-17T07:45:38Z,1,"Hi Krish. This is an appropriate opportunity to say thanks for your great videos and thank you for the good work you are making. I would like to comment regarding this video (time- 2:50) wel = welcome()     - is NOT a function copy, it is a function invocation wel = welcome        - creates a new reference to a function As you are an appreciated professional, may be I didn't follow your exact meaning. Can you please clarify? Thanks",True

@kingpanthom,2021-07-03T04:37:34Z,3,wel= welcome() actually copy the string to the variable wel and not the function. you did not call wel as function is called like wel(). The correct syntax to copy a function is wel = welcome without brackets.,True

@ittecheval1868,2021-05-07T14:09:42Z,0,"Closure mean, a function returned by another function and that returned function still have access to its sourrended variables where it is defined.",True
@broswhoknowstuff,2021-04-13T16:48:28Z,2,"Krish , excellent lessons!  Than you for your hard work! I learned a lot here. It made me think. If I may so boldly add some additional logic to your great lecture on the copying of function's. I think Python's `concept of scope` is also an important topic to touch on when explaining function copying. Scope's are created only at function invocation( execution or call) and names are either ""in scope"" or ""out-of-scope"". I defined the welcome( ) function and using the following two assignment's: wel = welcome( ) and wel = welcome. The first assignment assigns a function call value. The later, only the function definition. NOTE: In either assignment's, the variable that is used reference's the exact same memory location of the defined function. ( I also use both the print and return statement's.) In the first assignment [ wel = welcome( ) ] , I use the print statement and the <string_value>  prints to standard output on the call to  welcome( ). Now for function copying, and still using the print statement, I assign the variable 'wel' to 'welcome( )'. If I try to run ""wel( )"" I get `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable `.  ""None"" is also returned if you try to print the variable -  'wel'  because there is no 'name' value given for any existing variable in the function's scope, only a print statement. If I instead use a 'return` statement instead, the returned  'value"" is stored in the memory location of the welcome( ) function. The later  method: `wel = welcome` (without parentheses ) copies the welcome ( ) function definition AND it's function body to ""wel"". Big Note here: the welcome( ) function is not executed at assignment! Now when you execute, wel( ), you get the string value. This is because the variable 'wel' is able to reference the body of the welcome( ) function in the global scope and invoke it , which 'wel( )' runs and creates it's local scope at the invocation for the value returned by the print statement. Am I close?",True
@lokeshpatel5018,2021-02-10T03:56:03Z,1,"Thanks Krish, I just want to know what will be the type of 'wel' in function copy case. From my understanding it would be str() not function. as we've stored return value from function welcome and then stored to 'wel'. But if we remove the parentheses while calling that will assign the function object to 'wel'. Correct me If I'm missing anything here.",True

@susmitvengurlekar,2021-01-29T03:31:11Z,5,"You meant to code wel = welcome to demonstrating function copy right? Instead of wel = welcome() , which will just assign to wel whatever welcome() returns",True

@gopinathrajamanickam9475,2021-01-17T14:40:13Z,0,"Great Job Krish,  Closure is  something I never  used  as a terminology  and decorators were always  a black box until now.  I liked the logical building blocks in your teaching method. I think function copy  you mentioned  does not  copy the function as such, the variable wel  simply  stores the  result from the earlier execution of  welcome() . Correct me if I  am wrong.",True
