@arjunkrishna721,2021-10-05T15:37:03Z,3,"Hey Krish, You videos are amazing. Thanks a lot. I had a small question though, if we impute all the 0 values with mean in our dataset, won't the ""num_preg"" column be affected. Essentially 0 in num_preg is a valid input, but when it is being replaced by the mean, didn't we corrupt that column?",True
