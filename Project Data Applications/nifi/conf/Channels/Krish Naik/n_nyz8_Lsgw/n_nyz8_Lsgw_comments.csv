@equiwave80,2020-12-11T15:02:04Z,4,"Hi Krish,  To summarize we can say the below w.r.t Student scenario:  Scenario#1: Ideal Student or Role Model Student with Conceptual learning hence ends up as a Topper!!!  --> IDEAL MODEL Scenario#2: Bookworm or Mugging up expert who just memorizes the syllabus without really understanding the concepts --> OVERFITTING Scenario#3: Lazy Student who does not put any effort in preparing for the Exams hence ends up getting less scores --> UNDERFITTING Scenario#4: Paper Leakage resulting in temporary high scores but the student might end of performing badly in final exams --> DATA LEAKAGE  Thanks Krish now I will never forget the Overfitting and Underfitting concepts!!!  Regards, Deepak.",True
@hari141v,2020-12-10T11:54:26Z,1,A nice and simple example for overfitting and underfitting,True

@jifryissadeen5272,2020-12-08T13:45:23Z,1,Thanks Krish.. Keep doing the good job.,True
@tarung7088,2020-12-08T06:48:59Z,0,"Lets say tommorow is your semester exam and you havent studied anything in past. Now in one night you managed to mugged up everything in your head on considering that same questions will come tommorow.  Overfit:  the student who mugged up all the questions and answers word by word without understanding their gist. If a similar question appeared in the exam in a twisted way he won't be able to answer the question  Underfit:  the student who prepared very less for the exam and writes the same answer for every question   well-fit:   the student who prepares well enough to undrestand the gist of the question and answers. If a similar question appeared in the exam in a twisted way he will be able to answer the question.",True
@shahnawazkhan1636,2020-12-08T06:11:25Z,1,Awesome I understand 100% please make videos on real life scenario like this video. Again nicely explained krish sir,True
@Krishna-pn5je,2020-12-08T03:41:03Z,3,"Sir, Thanks for the very good example . I just want to reiterate the  above example  with small changes. Valid Model -> A student whose performs well in his internal exams as well as his final exam IIT because he understood the concepts very  well so he can  imagine if the question asked indirectly. Overfitted model -> A student who performs very well in internal exams but he fails to perform best in the  final exam IIT because he prepared  internal exams  based on previous questions  that were asked in the internal test  and did not understood the concepts very well. Underfitted Model -> A person does not perform well in the internal exams  so he cannot perform well as in Final exam like IIT. Data Leakage :-> A person trying to attempt a exam for which he already knows question before  the exam. and He cannot crack the other competitive exams .",True
