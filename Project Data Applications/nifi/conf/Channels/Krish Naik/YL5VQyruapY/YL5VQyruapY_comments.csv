@user-rs1wi4kt2h,2024-02-01T11:25:09Z,1,"But what about the deployment and scalability? Even though open source, LLM model requires huge resources to generate responses. Cost of such instances doesn't go well when compared with pay as you go API services from openai, claude, etc. Either way to build a scalable solution for a startup or enterprise one has to carefully understand the requirements and decide afterwards. Using open source model is barely the go to option. Sometimes, buying APIs would make sense sometimes it doesn't.",True
