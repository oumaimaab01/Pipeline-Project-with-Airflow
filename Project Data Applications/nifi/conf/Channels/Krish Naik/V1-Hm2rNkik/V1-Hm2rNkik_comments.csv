@vijaykant52,2021-05-20T14:49:30Z,1,"Let’s say I taught you four algorithm (A, B, C, D) for classification. I have collected one new dataset which contains 1000 observations with 11 features. We hired a team of experts to label the data class into either X or Y, they took 15 days to label 1000 entries. In next one month we‘ll also collect 1000 more observation. What strategy we need to follow to speed up our work.  How can one answer this question?",True
