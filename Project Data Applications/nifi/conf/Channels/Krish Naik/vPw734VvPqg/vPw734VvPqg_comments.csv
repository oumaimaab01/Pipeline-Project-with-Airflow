@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-15T17:44:16Z,3,"My opinion is that your channel doesn't need fancy animations. I like the white board and the conversational style of your teaching. I find your lectures easy to understand. üòä I like all the channels you mentioned, but I was a little disappointed with the Andrew Ng one. It has good information but it doesn't give a thorough explanation of the underlying math. There are too many times that Andrew says something like, ""It's OK if you don't understand the math. Many very good data scientists don't."" That part I disagree with. Still, the course is definitely worth watching. Four more channels I like a lot are:    1. Jeff Heaton    2. Enthought    3. PyData    4. Data School.",True
