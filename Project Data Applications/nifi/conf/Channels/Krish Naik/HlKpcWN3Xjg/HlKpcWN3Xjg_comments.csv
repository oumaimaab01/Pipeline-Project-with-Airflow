@deepakhari3960,2023-05-16T05:34:17Z,1,Hi Krish I also worked as an expert qa member in Chegg..  Point 1: when chat gpt can try to get better why won't Chegg. Chegg has a very good NLP team which uses OCR and finds plagiarism.  Point 2: Chegg has a huge database of questions and it has a capacity to train deep learning models. (There may be a surge in demand for ML and deep learning Engineering) Point 3: There will be some things which an AI model can do. And Chegg will concentrate on those points to grow.,True
@a7medz0,2023-05-12T16:26:11Z,1,I think Chegg might disappear in the future if the didn't react so fast because chatgpt is evolving and it will be more accurate>>,True

@quick1324,2023-05-04T02:44:01Z,1,"I think these AI models will only get better with time (e.g. GPT4, copilot x), so their involvement in various industries and our day to day life will only increase. But I also think that we can reduce the human element from all the industries but we  can never remove it completely.",True

@thryce82,2023-05-03T23:03:09Z,0,"this is a stupid title.  stock price does not ""take down a company""  it is literally what a company sold for ownership.  if it goes down too low then a company can buy it back decreasing the supply and then increasing its price.  The financial health of a compnay and its stock price are not nearly as correlated as this title implies.   It will get clicks and views from people who dont know any better.  It also makes me lose faith in the content this channel puts out.  If you arent riding some click bait then you dont understand basic business 101.",True
@tensorlab,2023-05-03T16:25:15Z,0,"What most people and Ed tech companies don‚Äôt understand or choose to ignore is, technology in itself isn‚Äôt desirable unless you have understanding of monetising it in terms of business context. A person might be expert in coding but if he cannot translate that skills to a meaningful solution in real world, he gets replaced. If technology by itself was path to money we wouldn‚Äôt have had enormous number of millionaires from non tech background. Unfortunately education in India fails to address this issue and is purely based on who can solve difficult problems and obtain highest mark‚Äôs possible.",True

So ChatGPT is not the complete solution",True
@visualsbysri,2023-05-03T15:59:23Z,1,Chegg and Chatgpt both are miserable in solving probability/stats problems. üòÖ,True
@fusion353,2023-05-03T15:38:53Z,1,"The dangers of this technology is that it will affect every company in all the fields if this companies starts using it heavily, because as an AI will start learning the domains and the intricacies of the business that many companies have developed and worked in a long time, and what would stop the owner of the AI to just start doing the same business using his AI, and opening all kinds of businesses in all fields to make more money, since this companies are giving away their know how for free by using this AI and training it, not to mention that the need for workers would decrees exponentially, so if anything if you have an expertise in certain area do not use it because is stilling your trade and your knowledge, do not train the very thing that will get you unemployed.",True

@vishaldas6346,2023-05-03T13:04:27Z,5,"What I am thinking is, today ChatGPT may not be giving proper solutions, but in future with advanced versions it will impact the entire IT sector to the maximum extent. Even a layman can type and get things done with a basic understanding of a language.  People will not seek for upgrading skills. I am sure in next 10-15 years,  IT will be in its worst position.",True

@raveensharma6738,2023-05-03T12:49:10Z,5,"It can easily complete half built code. I think its like a robotic arm to developers for now, where many coders will be leveraging its power for debugging, optimization, and code completion. Moreover, being an AI tool it will improve its accuracy over the time when its been used heavily by big companies. On impact to job, It will start reducing the no of developers needed in team. Where 1 developer can do work of two by saving most of time while using it",True
