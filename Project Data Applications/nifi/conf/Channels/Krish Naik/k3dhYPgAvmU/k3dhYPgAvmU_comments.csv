@ravitanwar9537,2021-01-03T15:02:28Z,2,O(n^2).   it seems its n^3. but I would say O(n^2) also isn't  O(n(n-1)) same as O(n^2)?,True

@ravisoni1386,2021-01-03T14:30:23Z,8,Just 1 advice for you. Your video title is not very distinct. Each video looks like same.  Please try to separate it like this. [50 Problem series] Problem2: <desc/video title> [Python Programming Tutorial] Tutorial 5: <video title>  I hope you understand the problem with your videos. I was really into that series of python problems and waiting for that but it is hard to differntiate between your videos.,True
@subhamprasad6808,2021-01-03T14:28:04Z,2,Thank you so much for providing such a detailed explanation in all your videos.,True
