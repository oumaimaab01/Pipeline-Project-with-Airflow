@rohank9292,2021-11-06T13:27:45Z,7,"Its good to see that you're celebrating Indian festivals like Diwali with puja and such fanfare. Otherwise, I've even worked in companies like HPE (now DXC) where foreign festivals like Haloween, Martyrs's Day, Easter and Christmas (most of which were unheard of by Indians like me) were celebrated more than any of the grand Indian festivals like Holi & Diwali. Even all the Muslim employees working in the company were given off on all of the Eid and Muharram days, shifts adjusted to suit their Ramzan timings, but for Hindu employees like me, no gifts, bonus or leave on any of the major Hindu festivals like Diwali & Holi or even New Year, with the comp off adjusted for later. I personally have come to office and worked even on Diwali night and New Year night while the rest of the world celebrated outside. They didn't know how to treat their good and loyal Indian employees fairly and thats why, that company has ceased to exist, broken down into several parts and the company that used to pride itself on being one of the big MNCs of the world had to later join hands with a small time Indian company, CSC, just in order to survive and be relevant after the parent company HP spat them out from their group like a person spits out a piece of chewing gum.",True
