@pritomroy2465,2020-11-19T21:05:39Z,2,"Learning with respect to statisticians and R users 1. Theory stat- Basic stat, probability, distribution, sampling distribution, Baise theory, ANOVA, sampling, time series analysis.  2. math- linear algebra, calculus, basic math(series).  3. ml models-  (inferential model) linear regression (multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation) logistic regression, ARIMA for time series.  (black box model) decision trees, LDA, QDA, PCA, UMAP, spline regression, SVM, K-means, naive base CNN, NN, RNN Enhance ML accuracy Bagging (ensembling), Boosting, Kernel trick, lesso and ridge regression.  math for ml- gradient descent, gini impurity, cross-entropy, mse, estimation technique (least square, likelihood estimation), matrix derivative  4. R programming  data structure- basically vector and dataFrame manipulation, a little bit of matrix and list. It is highly recommended to go through all the data structure manipulation in R language and know the data types eg(character, numeric, logical,factor) basicFunctions- loop (for, while), if-else, creating functions and some built-in basic function.  5. Packages  data cleaning and visualization Tidyverse (this is a meta-package inside it we have) dplyr (king of data wrangling), ggplot2 (itself is a beast for visualization), stringr, forcats, reader, purrr etc etc  modeling Tidymodels (meta-packages for all ml API integrated) broom, parsnip, tune, workflow, yardstick, recipe etc etc  web apps and dashboard shiny (web app, interactive dashboard), plotly (interactive dashboard)  some useful packages Rmarkdown, skimr, lubridate  NB. I still can't recommend you some packages for the time series analysis as I still don't try this and I don't have an idea about database language like MySQL but you don't need to know about tablo if you are good at ggplot2 and shiny. My recommendation if you have the time like you are doing graduation on statistics or mathematics follow this. This is a lot more time-consuming but once you learn, you are going to save the day.

At times where people are doing their best to fight this global pandemic and some of the top educational sites making their courses available for free. You went ahead and tried to grab this opportunity where people actually have time to improve their skills and perhaps add some new skills to their skill set by monetizing your courses. I'm not sure what to say about that other than conveying my disappointment.   If this was done at any other time i would have totally understand the move.
