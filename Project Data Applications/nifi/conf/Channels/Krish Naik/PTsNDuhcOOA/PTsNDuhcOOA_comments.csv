@libinkoshy632,2020-06-23T19:27:27Z,7,"Looking at such projects and such github profiles make me feel demotivated and I look at myself with inferiority. I studied all the algorithms and the statistics used,   data visualization tool, then started with flask but yet it is difficult to understand. To implement as a webpage it is important to learn web development principles, and then everyday you come across new terms, and you feel more disappointed. Then there is DL, NLP, image processing, Big Data, and the list goes on and on and on. Most of the time I feel directionless. I tried hackathons, never ever closer to good rankings. And then i see toppers solution, it is hard to understand. All this is disappointing. Would I ever get a job? Would I ever make any difference?",True
