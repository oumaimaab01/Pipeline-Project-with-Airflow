@johnward6516,2023-06-08T18:27:16Z,1,"After viewing your video, I thought I would give Bard another go but it just doesn't understand that multiple-task conversations. As an example in Bard and Bing chat (precise mode) try this prompt.  I would like you to ask me for a description for a Rally Story.   When I have provided that Description I would like you to then create a Rally story based on my description using these guidelines.  	1. I can be known as a ""Cloud Engineer"".  	2. I would like to include the reason why it is required.  	3. The acceptance criteria should be in bullet points.  	4. Please make sure there is enough description.  	5. Please make sure you add the section that states who I am.  	7. Please format the headings of each section. 	8. Justification should cover ""What would happen if we didn't do the story"" 	9. When breaking this story up into headings, can you use the headings  		a. Title:  		b. As:  		c. I would like:  		d. So that: 		e. Description:  		f. Justification: 		g. Tasks:  		h. Acceptance Criteria:  		i. Notes: 	10. It needs to be written in a friendly manner with plenty of information  	11. The language used to check grammar and spelling should be English (New Zealand) 	12. Grammar and spelling should be checked, add periods and question marks should be added if missing, this includes bullet points. 	13. Can you please make sure the Headings are bold so they stand out.  Bard just can't get the concept it needs to ask for the description first, then produce the Rally story :(",True
