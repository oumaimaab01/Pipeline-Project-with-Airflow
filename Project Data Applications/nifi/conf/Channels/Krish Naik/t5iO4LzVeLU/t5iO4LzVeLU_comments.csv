@mudassarm30,2023-08-28T18:59:42Z,0,"The iterator is made from the already existing list that is fully initialised in memory, I dont understand how did you save memory by using iterator ? Can you comment on it ?",True

@CutechildTV,2023-02-13T12:39:59Z,0,"Hi Krish, I will say you are wrong at this point. As you said in the video iterator that you generate get the memory location.  But they got the memory address. You can see as we have created iterator called as iterList still it retrieve element when we deleted the reference of the original list  list1= [1,2,3,4,5]  iterList = iter(list1) del list1  next(iterList)  I hope you can modify this video.  Everyone see this example!",True

@facts_region,2021-11-24T10:52:43Z,3,"Hi, I understand how efficiently can memory be utilized through Iterators. But  a basic doubt that I have  - In the example that's taken in the tutorial, the same lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is used for both the Iterable and Iterator. That means the list is already loaded into the memory both in case of Iterable and Iterator and a for loop is used to retrieve the elements. A little confused about the concept here.  Glad if @Krish or anyone clarifies :)",True

@utkarshgupta7310,2021-09-15T21:38:45Z,1,"Hi Krish, So once next element is initialised in the memory, say suppose 2 from list ex shown in video, does the memory initialisation for 1 initially goes off? Or it stays?",True
