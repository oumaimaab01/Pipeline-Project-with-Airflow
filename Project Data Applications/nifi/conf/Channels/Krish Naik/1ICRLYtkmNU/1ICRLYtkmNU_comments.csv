@lnsrivatchan4621,2024-04-14T15:43:28Z,0,"With regards to chatting with multiple pdf's FAISS is now complaining as below. Not sure if this is because FAISS was updated   ValueError: The de-serialization relies loading a pickle file. Pickle files can be modified to deliver a malicious payload that results in execution of arbitrary code on your machine.You will need to set `allow_dangerous_deserialization` to `True` to enable deserialization. If you do this, make sure that you trust the source of the data. For example, if you are loading a file that you created, and no that no one else has modified the file, then this is safe to do. Do not set this to `True` if you are loading a file from an untrusted source (e.g., some random site on the internet.).",True
