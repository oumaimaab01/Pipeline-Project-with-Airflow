@nabiltech1366,2021-01-04T11:04:11Z,1,You guys can simply understand Covariance by remembering this rules:  X*Y POSITIVE * POSITIVE = POSITIVE(+) NEGATIVE * NEGATIVE = POSITIVE(+) POSITIVE * NEGATIVE = NEGATIVE(-) NEGATIVE * POSITIVE = NEGATIVE(-),True

@jaysoni7812,2020-09-20T09:26:24Z,0,we should memorise this equations of statistics? Is it required in ML?,True
@sandipansarkar9211,2020-09-14T14:09:03Z,16,Thanks Krish .Now I am understanding why statistics is important in data science .People often miss this fact and suffer later while on the job.Thanks once again,True
@ayushisand7785,2020-09-09T07:37:32Z,0,"can we have a zero covariance? if yes, then what would it mean?",True
@shubhamsangole5598,2020-09-01T18:09:21Z,3,"To summarise; if the Covariance is positive, both the variables(size,price) are heading in same direction ie. both are increasing or decreasing. If the Covariance is negative, both are heading in opposite direction ie. one is increasing while the other is decreasing.",True
@Nandeesh_N,2020-08-06T11:21:31Z,0,"@krish When we substitute values in the covariance formula, we do get a finite number (strength) which can either be positive or negative (direction). Because in Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, we take the variance and divide it by SD of X and Y.. when we get the value from covariance, why exactly we need Pearson's Correlation Coefficient?",True

@njoy2075,2020-05-25T23:05:01Z,1,"Hi, Thank you very much for this video. I really like your videos. I have a question:   Cov(A, B)= (1/n)* Sum[(A- avg A)*(B- Avg B)]   ==> this is for population or sample ?? If It is sample then a) n =n-1  and b) while calculating the person coefficient the standard deviation formulae should also be n-1 or not?  as  my person coefficient value is going beyond -1 in a dataset which is not feasible.  can you please clear this doubt.",True
@KetakiVaidya,2020-04-30T19:52:33Z,0,Hi Krish. Thanks for the video. I request you to please sequence the videos per the content so that we can follow along the playlist,True

@DharaNaina,2020-02-15T12:33:29Z,0,Hi..thank you for explaining covariance. Just one question: +ve covariance means X is positively related to y and -ve covariance means X is negatively affecting y. But how can we say that X is NOT affecting y. In your example suppose someone trying to get covariance of floor number and park(just a vague example),True

@dipayanroy8357,2019-12-09T19:25:19Z,1,"Hi Krish, Thanks for the explanation. I noticed the python cov method divides the variance by (n-1) instead of n, as u have given in the formula for covariance. Can you please tell me why do we consider n for a population covariance and (n-1) for a sample covariance?",True
