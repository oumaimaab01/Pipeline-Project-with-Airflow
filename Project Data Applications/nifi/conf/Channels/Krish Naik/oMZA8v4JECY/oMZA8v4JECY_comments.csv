@rajnishadhikari9280,2023-03-15T05:40:55Z,0,"Hello sir I have enrolled in the full stack data science course from pw skills. I just got fresher role for Business Intelligence Analyst in one of the Internet companies in my country. But they want me to work as python developer also but I am not so much interested in developing. Also I will be continuing in data science. So in this case my question is that how much knowledge of python is necessary for data science? Beside Business Intelligence Analyst, do I need to work as python developer too? What do you suggest me on this case?",True
