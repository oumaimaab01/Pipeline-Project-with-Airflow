@GoFlyFeetOnGround,2022-01-31T05:42:01Z,0,"No trees or animal including human moving freely, what a messed up world already.  Imagine if the controller people are corrupt which mostly they are or just an AI developer pissed off having a bad day, if this is version of future then we're screwed from beginning.  There must be a simple better way, we Indians need to find our own version of future & not these narrow western heartless, dry emotionally & socially hollow, only maximising output, short sighted ones. Future must be freedom for everyone, all inclusive growth, nature, social health, support for poor & weak.   You guys are thinking in single mind & ignoring what is happening because of these decisions, now western world wants to go back to simpler ways & we're doomed to make the same mistakes they've made.",True
