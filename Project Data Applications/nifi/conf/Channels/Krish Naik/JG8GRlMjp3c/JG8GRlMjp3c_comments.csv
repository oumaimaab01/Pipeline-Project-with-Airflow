@rossmilburn7838,2023-10-31T07:03:35Z,1,"Krish Naik, I want to understand multivariate analysis better, and I found your tutorial 22 was excellent, you are a great presenter, perfect English, amazingly clear method of exploring the analysis problem with histograms, etc. But then I found tutorial 23 was recorded badly, so I could not understand your voice easily. I clicked on subscription, and heard you talking at length about your services (again, recording not clear), but most of it was not relevant to my specific need. Why can't you just show a price list of specific items? This could include little items like ""how to do multivariate analysis"" , or ""how to do bivariate analysis"", or ""How to join our 6-month course to be a data scientists"" , each with a price. But I am not prepared to join, just because you are an excellent teacher. I am a customer, and I want what is useful to me right now, not your views on a long-term relationship that may, or may not, be useful. But thank you for tutorial 22, and good luck.",True

Here is the problem:                                     There is an email marketing template and we want to replace it with a better template. A is the control template. We also test email templates B, C, D, and E. We send 100,000 emails of each template to different random users. We want to figure out what email gets the highest click-through rate. Template A gets 10% click-through rate(CTR). B gets 7% CTR. C gets 8.5% CTR. D gets 12% and E gets 14% CTR. We want to run our multivariate test till we get 95% confidence in a conclusion. Which of the following is true: a) E is better than A with over 95% confidence. B is worse than A with over 95% confidence. You need to run the test for longer to tell where C and D compare to A with 95% confidence b) Both D and E are better than A with 95% confidence. Both B and C are worse than A with over 95% confidence c) We have too little data to conclude that A is better or worse than any other template with 95% confidence",True
