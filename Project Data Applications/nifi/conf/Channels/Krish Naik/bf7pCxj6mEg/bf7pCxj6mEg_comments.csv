@argish,2024-01-22T12:17:09Z,1,"Initially, I faced so many problems with venvs that I almost gave up on making them, mainly because every time I had issues with module versions and other stuff, I used to delete whole venv and rebuild them xD. That not only was a waste of data but also consumed a lot of time since I was on a low bandwidth wifi. it was frustrating.  but eventually, I got the hang of it. only then I found that we can also use conda to make venv and it takes less time coz apparently conda caches libraries on their first install and then after, unless there is an update, it won't download the library again and instead use the cached file. fml. but the good thing is that I mastered working on both these environments.",True
