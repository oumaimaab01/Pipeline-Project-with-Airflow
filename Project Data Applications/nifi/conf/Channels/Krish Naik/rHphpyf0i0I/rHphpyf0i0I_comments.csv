Based on the same enrolled in one of the courses(generative AI) in ineuron.Though the topics covered are great, you definitely need to have a look at the articulation skills of the instructor.The quality is shockingly low and same is visible in the freecodecamp video as well.They are just throwing around some words while explaining key concepts and that too not very clearly.
