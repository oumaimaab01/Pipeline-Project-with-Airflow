@asqwer453,2022-05-04T14:44:25Z,0,"I'd focus on creating an argument parser and set my threshold to x as the default. (70%). From their, if I have to relocate the camera to a higher point, and then readjust the threshold within my argument parser to a lower number (40-50% confidence) and see how the model now performs. I'd focus on first ensuring the model localizes the object, then focus on the classification of that object until my model gets a close enough output that I desire.",True
@vikankshnath8068,2022-01-09T12:45:25Z,0,"1. as the size of the objects in the view area of camera will decrease with the height/distance of the camera from the scene, so a simple solution is to do scale up the image propotianally and feed up that approximate cropped area which was previously in camera view. 2. Now, the scaling up images may reduce the quality of images so go with such scaling approaches that does not harm image quality, and add some deblurring filters. Moreover, if budget allows replace the camera at new height with better resolution camera so that after scaling up the images, image quality remains same as that of previous ones.",True

@sharifm3682,2021-09-18T15:38:19Z,0,"So when we change the camera position, and run our model on new images, it will produce less accuracy in object detection on new images per new height,  so here simplest and cost effective approach would be  data  ""pre-processing"",  find the difference between higher accuracy data and current image (from new height w/ less accuracy) and then project the new image by that difference.  Its perfect example of data drift/shift.  Since training the model is expensive, better pre-process the new data by finding the diff between old (high accuracy) & new (less accuracy) data.  Since new data has more noise compare to old data (which was perfect) , so we have to minimize it or completely get rid of it thru pre-processing.",True

@krishnamore2281,2021-06-04T18:07:15Z,0,If the camera is placed at a height we will need to change the view by tilting the view.so the model will be of no use as it is trained with different view. But to tackle this problem we can move the camera behind at the elevated height .,True

In this fine-tuning process, a small learning rate (learning rate = 10− 5) could used to make a small variation to the pre-trained parameters. In this way, we will preserve the valuable parameters as much as possible by avoiding dramatic changes on the pre-trained parameters and let the model learn the special characteristics of changed camera position data",True
@zeeshansheikh8163,2021-06-03T13:34:04Z,1,By Considering some of the Post-processing techniques.  1.  Based on the height w.r.t aspect ratio calculating the original ratio of area of interest and we can crop it then zoom the image to get the original region. (here while cropping we can exclude the extra region which is in focus and which is not useful). 	note: why crop then zoom? why not zoom and crop? 		  --> after zooming and then cropping we may loose some pixel values so the best approach is to crop then zoom.  2. Even then we are facing any blur or noise in the image we can use the below techniques to enhance the image. 	--> Sharpening the image and smoothening the values with different kernel sizes. 	--> Using Image Enhancement techniques or point processing techniques based on contrast.  3. Or else if we have a lens which is cable of getting the focus region from the lens.(Don't know much about iot integration with respect to lens),True

@sivasai8829,2021-06-03T06:33:29Z,5,If we kept the camera higher from original position the object size will be decreased and some times our model may not recognize it.Then i think we can zoom the camera like appearimg from old position then it may work 🤔 and of course we should use good resolution camera,True

@prasannavenkatesh9700,2021-06-02T15:50:32Z,7,After changing the angle it may affect on detection accuracy. We can try the affine transformation of the image before passing to the model. It may help but without seeing the exact scenario it's hard for drawing the solutions.  Similar problem I have faced.

After rotating with -40 degree the results were good.  Very much eager to see the approach,True
