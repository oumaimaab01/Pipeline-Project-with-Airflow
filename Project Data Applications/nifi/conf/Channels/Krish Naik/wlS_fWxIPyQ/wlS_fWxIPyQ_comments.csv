@harshkr007,2023-11-13T12:59:20Z,0,"In Python versions before 3.7, dictionaries were unordered. This means that:  The order of items was arbitrary and unpredictable. Items could be accessed by key, but not by index. Iterating over the dictionary would yield items in an arbitrary order. This was because dictionaries in Python were implemented as hash tables under the hood. Hash tables store items based on their hash value, not their insertion order.  However, starting with Python 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. This means:  Items are stored and iterated in the order they were inserted. Items can be accessed by both key and index.",True
