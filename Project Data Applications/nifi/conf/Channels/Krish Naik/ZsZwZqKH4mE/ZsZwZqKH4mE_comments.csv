@ssrram525,2021-06-08T08:28:26Z,2,"Some of the factors to be considered are as below    •	It usually follows a recurrent pattern associated with events or activities that occur year after year  •	Three distinct periods:              o	Peak season - Demand exceeds capacity (Business is lost)             o	Off-peak season - Excess Capacity (wasted resource)             o	Shoulder seasons (spring and fall) - Demand exceeds optimal capacity (Service Quality Declines)  •	Holidays and special events  •	Time of day and day of week demand patterns •	Economic conditions •	Airline schedule changes  •	Time of booking  •	Cancellations and no-shows  •	Price   •	The relationship between the quantity demanded and the price offered is referred to as the price elasticity of demand. •	Business demand can have different price elasticity than leisure demand. •	Price elasticity is not always static within a market, it changes with time to arrival   •	Airlines divide customers into groups, or market segments, with common requirements or characteristics  •	This market segmentation is based in part on the customers’ “willingness to pay” •	One market segment, for example, is the business traveler who needs to be able to purchase or cancel his or her ticket at the last minute  •	Business travelers are willing to pay a higher price for a premium product and/or for flights at a more convenient time  •	Leisure travelers are more price-sensitive, that is to say, less willing to pay and willing to modify their date for a lower price   •	Airlines consider a number of variables when setting ticket prices including their costs, a ceiling price for each market segment, competitors’ prices, economic conditions, and customer behavior.  •	Revenue management (RM) pricing strategies are based on charging different prices to different customers in order to maximize revenue from a company’s available capacity at any time.  •	Cost driven vs Market driven  •	One-way vs return fare structure  •	Fare distribution spread between lowest-highest fare, fare increments  •	Fare conditions and restrictions minimum stay, advanced booking, flexibility  •	Fees and additional services  •	Promotions  •	Describes the situation when passengers who would have bought a ticket for a high fare according to their willingness to pay, buy a low fare ticket instead  o	Reasons: poor or no fences, availability allocation   •	Describes the situation when passengers buy a ticket for a higher fare, although a lower fare is available",True
