@tapabratacse,2023-07-01T01:42:35Z,3,@krish sadhanasu explanation with CNN is partially correct .....we can build time-sequence CNN+LSTM to do video analysis. Only reason CNN is used to  extract features and  reduce features  but here we already have the feature . So we can directly use   LSTM > RNN . Also we had done one mistake we have aggregated the data on year and removed month. We should have aggregated to a month and then based on EDA we could use SRIMAX or ARIMA,True

@rhiteshkumarsingh4401,2021-02-01T19:45:33Z,6,This was very very informational. I was recently interviewed for a data science role and i was also asked questions on cnn and transformer model. I answered everything related to cnn but i had no idea on nlp transformer model. It has helped me a lot by watching this interview. I was also asked on the recent popular models like gpt2 and gpt3.

Why would I apply a filter to select only those records from the dataset that have floating point values in day column whose datatype is already ""floating point""?  To select records containing string values in Gender column whose datatype is object we have to apply filter because object type column may contain numeric values enclosed in quotes.
