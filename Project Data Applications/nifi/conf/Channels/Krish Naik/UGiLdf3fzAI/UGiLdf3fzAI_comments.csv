@Mehraj_IITKGP,2023-01-20T05:06:43Z,1,"Summary of the video:  Pooling is a technique used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, while also reducing the number of parameters and computations in the network.   Pooling is typically applied after one or more convolutional layers, and it is used to down-sample the feature maps by summarizing the values of a group of adjacent neurons.  There are several types of pooling layers, but the most common are max pooling and average pooling.  In max pooling, the output of each neuron in the pooling layer is the maximum value of the corresponding group of neurons in the feature map.  In average pooling, the output of each neuron is the average value of the corresponding group of neurons.  Pooling helps to reduce overfitting and makes the model more robust to small translations and distortions in the input image.  It also helps to increase the spatial invariance of the model, which means that the model becomes less sensitive to the specific location of the features in the input image.",True

@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-19T17:51:08Z,18,"You draw cats so much better than I can. 😁 Image data augmentation makes so much sense once you understand how it works. It's not so hard to do it yourself if you want to play around with math and give yourself a chance to understand it better. If you want to do it fast though, a library like albumentations is really good. Also, it's good to run your models in Google colab using a GPU. The one problem I had with that is that it disconnects me about 10 hours, so I have to make sure to save my work often. Other than that, Google colab is great. 😊",True
