However, I may have found a mistake in this video or maybe it's just that I'm not thinking it right! In the end, you state that population mean will always be greater than the sample mean, I don't think this is a must hold for every sample. I mean wouldn't it depend on the sample we have taken? let's say we have a population of 6 people and heights are as follows- 6,6,6,3,3,3(in ft), Now if our sample is the first three people then the sample mean will be 6 and the population mean will always be somewhere around 4, right?",True
