@vahiagyat,2021-01-19T18:05:25Z,2,"In the other video of Krish regarding certification, I have put a detailed comment on my experience with certifications  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6GfF8fB7E4&lc=z23xez04uzudy3u0wacdp434nhxrswf20wbker2aqllw03c010c.1609430664821880  It's Krish's video only not mine. Just to brief, I have done lots of courses/certifications in general and also specific to Data Science - completed Masters Program from Simplilearn, have done Coursera courses, Udacity at one point of time, and I do audit various other courses available in the market. So, have shared my experience and what to look for when going to choose a course/certification.  When can certification benefit: 1> To showcase in office in your appraisal - what Krish mentioned. 2> In many companies, to do transition within the company itself, helps. One way is to do something on your own and show it to your manager/DS manager etc. But some companies which are still too process-oriented/bureaucratic in nature - they will ask for some piece of paper certifying you have the knowledge of the subject!  3> Some certifications help in getting recruiters' attention. Yes, it will not get you the job but to get the attention of a recruiter is also a big deal. Recently, I saw one job post which required experience/knowledge in sagemaker. Yes, certification is not mandatory but if you have one it helps because that part is mentioned as good to have. You have to understand many times recruitment is given to HR agencies and you might not get a good talent req person. I had to explain a few recruiter Data Engineers and Data Scientists are different. So, for such person certification does help.  Having said it, you have to outweigh the opportunity cost - the money and time you spend, and what you get in return ROI. If doing some other activities you can get better ROI - definitely go for it. Even if you plan for a course, do select it wisely - some courses are too costly but don't you that much hands-on. Wrote a whole blog on how to select a course - https://anantjigyasa.com/how-to-select-data-science-courses/  Ph.D. and Masters: Whether To-Do Masters/Ph.D. or not? Doing Masters certainly help in shortening the span of going from mass data scientist to niche data scientist. (not always). It helps in getting the DS/ML jobs too even if you don't have prior experience in the field. Many companies have this criterion so your cv will be weeded out if you don't have an MS. So it definitely helps. Additionally, it helps by providing a defined curriculum and when you study in a group you are motivated and are on target.  But it does require - time and money. Depending on what stage of life you are it may or may not be feasible for you. MS from USA universities is a little too costly! Germany is a good option - many of my friends did MS from Germany. It's not that costly, visa rules are lenient and the job market for AI/DS is good. Most univ requires GRE for MS, but a few do accept GMAT scores. In good universities, the competition will be too high especially for Indian, Male, Engineer profiles. In addition to this, you need to have IELTS or TOEFL depending upon the country. All these exams cost you around 13K (Approx) each - so around 26K ~30K assuming you will buy an official guide to prepare for the same. If you take some courses for these exams then the cost will shoot up! M.Tech from India is cheaper compared to the MS but it's worth only when done from the top colleges. If you choose MS then please make sure you plan to work abroad only - don't come back to India at least for few years (paying back the USA standard loan will be difficult on the Indian standard Salary!).  PhD - Don't go for the Ph.D. just for a job - you won't be able to sustain it. Believe me, a Ph.D. requires lots of patience and dedication. Go for that only if you truly like research and that field. Post Ph.D. definitely you will be getting good offers in the fields which are still growing - one of my friends post his Ph.D. got a job in Alexa Vernacular model (Vernacular - local language). By just having knowledge of the standard model it might be hard to get into this kind of job that too without too much experience in the field. Of course, if you can showcase the same kind of knowledge without a Ph.D. you have the chance but a degree helps the recruiter in weeding out the unwanted candidates. If you really into research and your dream is to work as a researcher in Google, FB, Amazon kinda companies then do go for it but be prepared for a tough road ahead. Ph.D. is not like MAsters and requires lots of patience. But if you truly like it then you will get job satisfaction which is invaluable.",True
