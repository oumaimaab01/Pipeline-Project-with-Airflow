@dakshanathwani9011,2021-05-28T08:35:44Z,1,"Hello Krish Sir,    I just saw your youtube channel when I was looking for a carrier switch and I must say you're doing a really awesome job. You have literally explained everything in the simplest way possible and helping a lot of data science aspirants.    I have a request for you sir. I am planning to start a new carrier and I am confused between the 2 most hot topics in the town. i.e. Data Science and Blockchain.    I already know about data science through your channel and you are kind of a mentor to me. Recently crypto is the hottest thing and holds tremendous potential which lies on the blockchain which makes it as well a very promising carrier option.    I am sure this problem would be faced by many other people. As a mentor, if you could please make a youtube video throwing light on blockchain technology and the use cases it serves and future growth and current Industry adaptation, and some of your personal research and personal view then it will be a great help for me and other people as well.    I really hope you consider my sincere request sir!    Thank you very much in advance!    Your Mentee  Lokesh",True
