@iam__jasn,2022-02-03T09:00:26Z,0,New here .. subscribed... üòÄ Got some useful information...thank you so much .. starting my learning journey with your channel... üôè ...just want to mention one real life example so that I can understand difference better ..pls correct me if I am wrong... Say YouTube ... Youtube is constantly storing my all data.. everything like what stuffs I am interested what kind of videos. ..so all these data are  effectively stored by data engineer...then analysis was done by data analyst that what kind of stuffs I am watching and many more such analysis...then basis of that analysis what kind of videos is recommended to me is done by data scientist ... Hope this assumption is correct!!!,True

@jvjjjvvv9157,2021-04-10T16:22:37Z,0,"I would really appreciate any feedback regarding what I'm going to ask, specially from people working in these fields.  I am 36 years old, I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science and I work as a software developer, but I have never been too interested in tech. I am pretty sure I would be better suited for a job involving more analysis and more 'strategical thinking', something that is less technical and more about 'seeing the big picture' than programming is. I am very interested in fields like politics, marketing, social sciences and so on, and I guess there is much use for Big Data in all of these, so I would like to find a job where I can be closer to 'real world' fields like those while still taking advantage of the IT background I already have.  My initial impulse is to go for Data Science because it seems more complex and interesting and it also appears that it would pay better, but I have a slight fear that in the end it might feel too technical: too much about mathematical models and too little about 'real world' analysis or decisions. This makes me want to reconsider and give Data Analysis a second thought, but I'm not sure it would any be better for me in this sense, and honestly I am not as interested in tasks like reports, visualization, etc.  I know it's probably wishful thinking to believe that any stranger could help me much in making up my mind, but...any thoughts?",True

@RahulSharma-datasaur,2019-09-29T14:00:39Z,1,"Great video. But would like to add a couple of points as below: You have mixed a lot of things. Data analyst is not just about creating visualisations it is more about presenting to right things business which data scientists are not good at.  Data engineer is not only responsible for storing the data efficiently. They are responsible for transforming that raw data in a usable format for DS. they are also responsible for ingestion, storage and processing of data. Storage is a very little part in the journey of data engineer work. And Data scientists are usually not responsible for taking care of optimisations. A new role called as ML engineer takes care of the operations of the model. Data scientist is just a guy who has good hold on maths and stats than software engineering. While having said that, if lucky enough companies can find ds with good SE skills too.",True
