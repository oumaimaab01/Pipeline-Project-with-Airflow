@dehumanizer668,2022-06-29T09:17:07Z,5,"Actually there is a mistake. Shouldn't add 27 to the list after calculating Q1, Q3 and IQR.

@adityaayaan8727,2021-10-12T15:47:00Z,0,Why boxplot always show outliers in right side of the graph we know that the outliers can be both side why it doesn't show outliers in left side,True
@souravpanda2686,2021-09-21T06:08:27Z,3,you have used the IQR value from the previous calculation without the addition of 27 in practice we can take the whole data set and as I see it won't make any difference. correct me if I am wrong,True
