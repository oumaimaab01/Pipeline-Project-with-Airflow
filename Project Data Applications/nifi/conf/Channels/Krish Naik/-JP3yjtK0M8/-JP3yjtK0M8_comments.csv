I appeared for Amazon DS I interviews  two months back and cleared.  It starts with Phone screening round where mostly all of your previous works,overall knowledege is discussed. Once you clear this next round is on Coding,SQL. And if you clear both the rounds, there will be 4 onsite rounds where they mostly focus on Amazon Leadership Principles and will ask relevant questions from your past projects and also technical abilities will be evaluated in these 4 rounds. And then the final round is BAR Raiser round which only focuses on Leadership Principles of Amazon. Then all the onsite interviewers and Bar raiser sit together and debrief happens. There is no as such HR round. HR calls you very informally and roll out the offer.",True
