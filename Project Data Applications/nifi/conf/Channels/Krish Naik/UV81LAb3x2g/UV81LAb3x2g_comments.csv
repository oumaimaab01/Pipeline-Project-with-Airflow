@pramodj-vn4xp,2024-05-27T17:37:44Z,1,"Sir, 1. how to pass input variables  among the agents?   2. How to have control over final output?  If data is coming from multiple agents like rag, websearch, youtube search, user input etc. I want to store whole data in same file without summarizing what other agents have collected. ( if final agent summarizing i am loosing valuable insights coming from previous agents)  Could you provide insights on it  3. If agent to task is one to one relationship then what is use  of having  two seperate entities? They could be merged and kept in agent itself with just extra attributes. Why did they choose to keep them seperate?   Look forward to hear from you",True
