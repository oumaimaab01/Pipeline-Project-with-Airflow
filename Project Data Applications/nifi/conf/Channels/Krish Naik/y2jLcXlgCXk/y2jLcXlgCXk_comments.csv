@incredibleworld2162,2023-02-20T14:35:49Z,8,"hello krish sir, I understand that he is fresher in data science industry but he is a Computer Science student, he has done MBA from IIT as well so I don't think calling him fresher and him getting the job in DS industry would be big hustle. I have done my graduation in chemistry and then I worked as a CSR for a year and then I enrolled in Great Learning for diploma in Data science. In few weeks I will be in placement pool. My point is I am not spreading any hate I am happy for him and I respect you a lot but I think you should focus more on students who have changed their field completely and they have done successful transition and then I think they are the real freshers. Thank you!",True
