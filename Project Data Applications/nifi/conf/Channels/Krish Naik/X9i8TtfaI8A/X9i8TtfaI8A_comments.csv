@Virtualexist,2022-11-10T03:49:14Z,16,"Underperforming people are always at risk, even without layoffs, but the thing about recession is it does not see the skill set.

Skillset skill set skillset, people will become robots if they take every breath considering skillset and moulding their life just for a job. I am someone happily opening a bakery and earning 20% of so called job where you are always at stress of gettting fired or whatever. I have only 1 life. And I want to live it with clarity.
