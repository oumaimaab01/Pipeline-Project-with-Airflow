@thepresistence5935,2021-08-31T11:52:43Z,0,if the target variable is a categorical column means what do we do?,True
@prateekkhanna4590,2021-05-26T17:58:38Z,1,"Krish Sir, I have a doubt.. Suppose we replace the cabin categories with prob on basis of survived column as shown by you in video. Now when we train our model to predict survived column, aren't we over representing cabin column. Like when the data came raw cabin has some predictive power to predict Survived in which we added some more power by assigning probabilities!  Hope you understood my doubt and will reply Sir.",True
@ashwanikumar-zh1mq,2021-01-06T18:24:19Z,1,Here how the mean value is related to the probality,True
@chaitanyakumarsomagani592,2021-01-02T05:50:48Z,0,how could the probability is more than ONE,True
@ssbabray,2020-08-28T09:58:02Z,0,HI Krish. How do we do probability encoding for the test set as Target variable is not available in the test set? Do we have to use the training set probability ratio values to the categories of test set also?,True
@charanpreetsinghbhatia7184,2020-07-21T22:35:01Z,0,Is this not odds of survived rather than peobability ?,True
