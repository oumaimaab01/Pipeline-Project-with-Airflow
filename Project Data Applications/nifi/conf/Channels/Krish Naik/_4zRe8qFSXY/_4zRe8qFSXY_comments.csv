@the_man_without_fear__,2022-05-27T04:36:44Z,0,"Lessons from this video: 1. Enjoying the specific journey is very much important when we trying to achieve the goal.  2. Journey matters more than the specific goal you want to achieve. 3. Journey has always ups and downs, it's zig- zig pattern. Apart of that, you must enjoy both ups and downs. 4. Failures gives you lessons. 5. Goals are not for lifetime, they are your desires you want to fullfill.",True
