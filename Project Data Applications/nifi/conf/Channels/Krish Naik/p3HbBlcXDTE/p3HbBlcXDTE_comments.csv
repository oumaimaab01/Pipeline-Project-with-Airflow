@marcin6386,2022-11-09T00:31:38Z,0,"In Euclidean distance it makes a lot of sense when you have 2 vectors(points in space). But with 3 points it doesn't make sense.  - x_1 is a first feature value  - x_2 is a second feature value - (x_1, y_1) - is a vector of two data points - (x_2, y_2) - is a vector of next two data points ( that we want to measure the distance to )  sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 } - makes sense.  sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (n_2-n_1)^2 } - don't make sense.   because you have n_2 - which is third feature value  and n_3 which is  fourth feature value.. You don't have a point in space, you only have two points on X axis without another 2 points on Y axis that way. I really can't understand that. It would mean that you can calculate this only if you have even number of features. Which is not true.",True

Thanks and I wished that people stick to familiar terms and not make it sound terrifying.  The proper term should have been distance between two points and it would have sounded familiar.
