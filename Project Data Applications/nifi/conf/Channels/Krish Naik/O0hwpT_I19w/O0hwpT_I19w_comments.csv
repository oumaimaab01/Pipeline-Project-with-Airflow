They try, analyze improve and make all sorts of improvisations in order to make their product reach the level of perfection. Thats the reason I feel proud to be a student of ineuron. The attitude of my mentors have dragged me out of all sorts of external temporary motivations that I was fallen into a few months back. The tech knowledge  can be fetched at many places but this experience is something one can only get at ineuron. There are a tons of book written on what actually goes inside a CEOs/great leaders mind but thanks to krish sir for sometimes practically giving us a glimpse of that through short video clips.  Will forever be grateful to ineuron 🙏🏻 Happy diwali respected sir. Always Praying for your well being.",True
