@noname-gh8pf,2021-05-20T04:57:44Z,0,"there is no such thing as dependent events merely because something depends upon other unless it has some meaning . Even to be called for independent there should be something to be depend on.  i mean you can not put the demarcation between dependent and independent. even dependent events use the independent theory (multiplication theory). for example, a man of eighty has less chance of surviving than a healthy young man. probability is dependent on his age. but the probability of his infatuation of woman is likely to be same even though chance of infatuation depends on his age(in this case). while computing this probability (infatuation) you use the independent formula to the dependent one. for the sake of linguistic purpose, yes you can.  people have misunderstanding about it. independent events is mathematical but dependent is just a word in English.  i have never seen any book quoting about the dependent event.",True
@dude5697,2021-05-18T04:03:09Z,0,"In 5:00 min, did you mean the b in p(b|a) as event or probability of picking up a black ball?",True
@Nidhsgoyal,2021-05-02T16:09:02Z,0,Sir please help me in understanding that ... P(B) event that is 1/4 when there is 1 black marble out of 4. And P(B|A) is also the same scenario when A event has occurred and we r having 1 black marble out of 4 marbles. Then how we will differentiate between the two. As we have done P(A)*P(B)=2/5*1/4=1/10,True
