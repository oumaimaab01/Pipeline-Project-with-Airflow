@AmarSharma60436,2024-01-03T17:04:43Z,1,"*ML Algorithms:* Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are computational models that learn patterns and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. They include supervised learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees), unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning.  *Life Cycle of Data Science:* The data science life cycle involves stages such as problem definition, data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, and deployment. It's a cyclical process where feedback from one stage informs improvements in subsequent stages.  *Deep Learning:* Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations from data and are particularly effective in tasks such as image and speech recognition.  *Optimization:* In machine learning, optimization refers to the process of adjusting model parameters to minimize the error or loss function. This is often achieved using optimization algorithms like gradient descent, which iteratively updates model parameters to find the optimal values.  *Loss Function:* A loss function measures the difference between the predicted values of a model and the actual values (ground truth). The goal during training is to minimize this loss, guiding the model towards better performance. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression and cross-entropy for classification.  *Your Projects (House Price Detection):* I don't have personal projects, but I can help you understand and discuss various machine learning projects, including house price prediction. This typically involves using regression models to estimate house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.  *Activation Function:* In neural networks, an activation function introduces non-linearity to the model. It decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU. They introduce non-linearities, allowing neural networks to learn complex patterns and relationships in data.",True
