@megd9849,2023-12-20T17:30:14Z,0,"You should remove the word 'debug' from your title. You did no debugging and did not show how it works in codespaces. In codespaces none of my debugger statements or breakpoints are working, either in VSCode or in browser for my front end application. The Sources panel in chrome debugger tools is not mapping to my remote reposository, as by default it only maps to local files. Can you do a video on debugging front end apps in codespaces if you have been able to do so?",True
