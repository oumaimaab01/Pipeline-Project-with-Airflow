I can give a better suggestion but A Lil risky, Just say that my notice period is 60 days and get the offer to join after 60 days and resign. Attend any other interview don't ask for more hike, show that you are ok if they can match the salary with the offer and show like... you are interested in this company more and don't care about money"""""""". and also If required edit the offer letter joining date calculating 90 days. :D So the next offer letter joining is after 90 days after your notice period is over. THIS IS VERY RISKY...in the sense, if you won't get another offer during 60 days you will be jobless :P but not risky by editing the offer letter, nobody is going to validate it with another employer that ""did you send this offer to this guy"".

Someone using the above technique with my company will not get far.

It is working to the disadvantage of both employee and employers. Our company has 1 month notice period and if we are putting a staff on critical projects, we ask for a commitment (verbal) from Employee for an additional month.
