@vivekjoshi3769,2021-02-12T06:13:28Z,1,"I have a doubt that in FAANG companies they look out educational qual  a lot than portfolio/Github etc. but I am unsure about this. So I think these jobs are limited to people having BS in STEM/Statistics/Economics. That means people who have an Educational Qualification in Non- Quant Fields like Psychology, Linguistics, Arts, Business have no hope in this. That implies if you want to get a DS/ DA job in very good companies you should have a technical degrees. Therefore to become a Data Scientist one should have a Computer Science Degree/ STEM.   Yes you can work in Startups at DS/DA positions but till when. There comes a time in life when everyone has a dream to work in these companies (FAANG or like CISCO) one day. I wonder how this gap is being bridged.",True
