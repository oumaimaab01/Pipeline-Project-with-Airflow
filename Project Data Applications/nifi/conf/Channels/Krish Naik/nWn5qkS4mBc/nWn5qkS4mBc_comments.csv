@avinashbhardwaz5717,2024-01-28T19:40:47Z,0,"Since in this case false negative is what it says our machines health condition is good but prediction is saying that it's not good.  So we can go and check that particular machine.   In case of false positive , in actuality machine health is not good but prediction is saying that our machines health is good. It's a danger , since we will not care that machine since it says machine conditions is good.  So it's a point where we need to think.  So we need to reduce false positive and hence we can go for  increasing precision.",True

@techtam3505,2021-07-19T05:16:07Z,2,If the Model is slow and huge in parameters my suggestion would be to first do mixed precision training using Apex and do inference in fp16 also we must choose the right hyperparams for the model as fp16 consumes less memory low cost gpu can be used and could be made more implemetable.  Some people are saying deploying models aren't a part of data science but it is a part you should come up with algorithms to solve them instead of throwing money on high compute GPU.   Also for parking problem  shouldn't have gone to NN  It is like using sword to cut potatoes,True

This is Ch1 of DIP. You take an image of an empty parking lot. Then take an image every 10 seconds or so and subtract it from the first.
