@ticertice9132,2020-11-24T03:59:59Z,0,"I've been preaching five books for the last 4 years because of three dreams I almost became an atheist if it wasn't for the dreams.    I found out Paul was a false Apostle and was taking his books out and in a dream I heard five books, in another dream I heard also the books of Thomas and Phillip after taking books affiliated with Paul out, after taking out the Book of Revelations I see myself tell my kids you know how to read the Bible in a dream, the books I got are Matthew, John, First John, Gospel of Thomas and Gospel of Philip.      There's many flaws in the bible and I go into details why I took these books out on my website ticertice.com.  , I don't ask for any money or donations or help financially or tithings , Facebook Ticer Tice https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011399036855, but for one example in Revelation Our Savior says he's the Morning Star and Isaiah the morning star was cast from heaven in Job chapter 38:6-7 we see the Cornerstone and the morning star are in the same verse,and one more example in the last chapter of James it says if you're sick let the elders lay their hands upon you and if you sinned your sins are forgiven, to be forgiven you're suppose to repent and forgive others.      So because of the five books I'm still a Christian and there's many people who have discovered the flaws in the bible and became other religions or stop believing all together, because of the teachings from the five books my walk is easy I used to be sad and lonely basically every day but now I'm happy and I'm not like I used to be back then a backsliding Christian basically every other day.   I found out recently that we've been tricked ,the church was made upon conquering and killing off Gnostics and destroying Gnostic books which they mention Bride Groom, Bridal Chamber, The Light Within, I even found out Mary Magdalene Was the most loved of disciple and the apostle to the apostles, now I know for you to hear  this, you probably think I'm possessed, lying or playing around, but I can assure you I'm not,something interesting I met Our Father in Heaven, our Saviour two times and angel Gabriel in dreams and flew 127 times in dreams, after Gathering the five books ,I was even cured of fibromyalgia when done finding the five books.     Here's some of my research  ---- Thomas saying 19 [19]. ""For you have there, in Paradise, five trees which change not winter nor summer, whose leaves do not fall: whoever knows them will not taste death!"" ----   what the prophets said it's still in effect Matthew 5:17 ""Don't think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill. ---- Isaiah 28:12-13 To whom he has said this is rest give rest to the weary and this is Repose yet they would not hear therefore the word of the Lord will be to them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little they may go and fall backward and be broken ensnared and taken. - It was propchied the word would be in a mystery puzzle basically, but by dreams and time and help, it is here to be heard before end times, if you believe in the bible, you should take what it says as serious as you do other verses. -- Until this prophecy fulfilled the word would still be confusing. Isaiah 6:9-11  9 And He said, “Go, and tell this people:‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’10 “Make the heart of this people dull,And their ears heavy,And shut their eyes;Lest they see with their eyes,And hear with their ears,And understand with their heart,And return and be healed.”11 Then I said, “Lord, how long?”And He answered:“Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant,The houses are without a man,The land is utterly desolate, - Their was a war in 1945 in Israel, The Nag Hammadi books were discovered in 1945 and the Dead sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 which relate in Scripture with the Greek Septuagint over the Hebrew Masoretic translations. ---- Jeremiah 23:28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD. ---- Apocalypse of Peter,   And if they say that a dream came from a demon worthy of their error, then they shall be given perdition instead of incorruption."" ""For evil cannot produce good fruit. For the place from which each of them is produces that which is like itself; for not every soul is of the truth, nor of immortality. For every soul of these ages has death assigned to it in our view, because it is always a slave, since it is created for its desires and their eternal destruction, in which they are and from which they are. They love the creatures of the matter which came forth with them."" ---- Daniel 12:4 But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.” ---- Matthew 24:45 Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant? The master will put that person in charge of giving the other servants their food at the right time. ---- Be single Matthew 22:30 30 For in the ""Resurrection"" they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.  Philip 80 80Resurrection and Baptism People who say they will first die and then arise are wrong. If they do not receive the ""Resurrection"" first, while they are alive, they will receive nothing when they die. So it is said of baptism, “Great is baptism,” for if people receive it, they will live. ---- Vegan Scripture  Psalms 78:27-32  27He also rained meat on them like the dust,Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas;28And He let them fall in the midst of their camp,All around their dwellings. 29So they ate and were well filled, For He gave them their own desire. 30They were not [g]deprived of their craving;But while their food was still in their mouths,31The wrath of God came against them,And slew the stoutest of them, And struck down the choice men of Israel. ---- Theirs so many reasons why I could say why Paul is a false apostle so instead of giving one I'll just ask a question which no one seems to answer when is the wolf in sheep's clothing suppose to come and what is the wolf supposed to do? ---- John 1:15 15 “If you love me, keep my commands. -------if you love our Saviour you'd keep the commandments, no debate . ---- What I believe and think the real Christians were killed off and labeled gnostics and heresies their books were destroyed and the groups of powers came up with the scheme to take over to religion ,put their pagan rituals into the Bible and hide the truth from us. ---- Hidden and adding warnings  Luke 11:52 “Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in you hindered.”  Gospel of Thomas 39 (39) Jesus said: The Pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (and) have hidden them. They did not go in, and those who wished to go in they did not allow. But you, be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.  Matthew 16:12 12 Then the disciples understood that he was not warning them to guard themselves from the yeast used in bread but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ---- So you could see that we have to be wise as a serpent to realize what our Saviour was saying they will take books out and they will add books ,I wouldn't have known this if it wasn't for the dreams. ---- in 1321 a real Christian which are known by Cathars prophesied in 700 years the good man and woman will return, next year is that 700 mark, and many people are having dreams of our Saviour saying he's coming back soon and tell his people, and rapture dreams.  The Cathars is in Southern France and they practice celibacy and vegan life's also that's where Mary Magdalene went to France . ---- Something to think about Mary Magdalene and Thomas have went out to preach, so if these accounts are true, they are the original real Christian teachings. ---- My recent discoveries are the Gospel of the Holy Twelve I believe it's the original source and there are similarities of Matthew but I think it's possible that some of it has been corrupted, it mentions not to eat animals a lot. ---- For you new Christians I know this is a lot to understand and to accept but you have to acknowledge that verses are saying they are still valid and for the older Christians you may know your walk is extremely challenging every other day basically and you probably wonder why you have sadness , feeling of being lonely and urges.      I failed many times and if it wasn't for me practicing to be vegan and celibate I don't doubt that I'd still be failing.    For those who do not know what celibate means, basically to be single and I practice till the day I die so I don't think about trying to be with the woman later and there's scripture that supports this,these teachings make my walk much better because I do not think about the time I would be with a spouse.    And to be vegan means not to eat anything that was killed ,the way I practice it includes milk, cheese and what I also do practice because of Dreams I do not drink energy drinks or coffee.    So if you all want to see how it could be encouraged you all to try to take the books seriously and try the walk for yourselves because it works and saved me from being a repeat failure. ---- My Dream Dreamed I flew up from a carnival and seemed to be zombies as left the ground and I flew to heaven I guess and door shut like a cellar door and appeared as it closed was a book opened with golden letters writings.  dreams show me I'm on the right path. ---- Good Luck on your Journey  ---------------------",True
