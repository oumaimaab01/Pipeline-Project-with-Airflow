@jorge1869,2022-04-18T17:00:40Z,0,"New and good alternative languages to Python may emerge, the problem is that none of these languages could catch up to Python in terms of the entire ecosystem of frameworks and libraries that it has, neither in the short nor in the long term. Let's face it, maybe by the time Julia annihilates Python (undoubtedly), we'll either be in a nursing home or 15 feet underground.",True
@MoheeJarada,2021-09-01T16:38:53Z,0,"Thanks a lot for the interesting video and you have very strong points here, but i missed out important benchmark between programming language competitors.  I believe that Python will remain in the next 8 years in the market, because of strong side for AI, ML and also for simple web frameworks available there.  Again thanks.

@jamesjr.colongan2203,2020-10-14T09:29:04Z,2,Try with C/C++ as it is the native support for WebAssembly. WebAssembly can be used by Javascript interchangeably which will empower the next generation of the Web.,True
@SpellboundHaven,2020-10-14T08:20:24Z,0,I agree. But right now we need APIs that facilitate training Neural Networks on AMD Graphics Cards. Nvidia is exploiting us too much.
