@a.b.5071,2021-07-01T09:53:21Z,0,Hey Kris! I don't know if you're going to reply or not! I recently came across your channel! I'm a humanities post graduate but sitting jobless since the pandemic. Now I'm keen to learn some new skills like data analytics and get employed . Idk what course to do? Am I able to get a job by the completion of it or how will I be getting hired? I really have no idea and no one to ask to. Also not much fond of Mathematics! Aha! Idk what to do with my life at this point of time!,True
@ganeshrao405,2021-06-30T09:18:28Z,2,R2 and adjusted R2 used for specific linear problems.  R2 vs Mse used for less outliers for both linear & non linear problems.  MAE if the dataset has many outlier we can use this to check.  RMSE for to low residual errors,True
@ayushsingh-qn8sb,2021-06-30T05:46:15Z,1,Please make a video on when we should use what,True
@imdadood5705,2021-06-30T04:27:51Z,0,"The difference between MSE and MAE, is  that MSE have higher penalties for larger errors compared to MAE. Example: if the predicted value is 2 and the actual value is 4, then the MSE becomes 4, when the predicted value is 2 and the actual value is 5, then the MSE becomes 9. Even though the actual values have been in a linear order but the errors take in an quadratic order.",True
@lalitchowdhary4238,2021-06-30T03:27:28Z,1,"Sir can we write a application that spin the words in a sentence without changing its meaning, like article spinner. If yes, then how can we do?Plzz rplyüôèüôèüôè",True
@cybergame.,2021-06-30T03:21:26Z,2,What is the best book to learn machine learning deeply?,True
@datareactor4143,2021-06-29T19:56:34Z,10,"R2 indicates how good the models fits the dataset where the values lies between 0 to 1(Worse-good) where we have many independent features there we use adjusted R square which explains which features are helpful in making the predictions. MAE is calculated as true-predicted values, takes average of the error from every sample in the dataset and gives output. But MSE is better to use when dataset has outliers, calculation wise we square the error value so there is no -ve values.",True
@shubhangisakarkar9532,2021-06-29T18:30:05Z,10,R2 score tells how much data has been fitted by best fit line. However r2 score doesn't tells whether the features used to create model is really helping in prediction or not. So to penalize the non correlated features with respect target we use adjusted r2 score,True
@abhishekpr2935,2021-06-29T17:41:17Z,0,Damn! This intro is sick! Always pumps me up before even starting to see the video,True
@mukeshkund4465,2021-06-29T17:14:17Z,4,I think we can derive Rsquared in terms of MSE i.e 1 - MSE/VARIANCE(y)...MSE get pronnounced based on whether data is scaled or not because Rsquared is standardized version of MSE...it represents the fraction of variance of response variable captured by the regression model..it gives better picture quality of regression model..,True
@AshutoshTyagii,2021-06-29T16:14:11Z,3,- Usually R squared is scaled between 0 & 1 but RMSE is not scaled.  - R sqaured can be easily interpreted but RMSE explicitly indicate us that how much prediction deviates on average from the actual values.,True

@Yashgupta-dd6eq,2021-06-29T15:46:14Z,12,"Basically,  R-Squared is defined as how much our regression line remove the error as we compared to our mean line.  ------------------------------------------------------  Adjusted R-Squared is defined as the new R-Squared when we add or remove any columns.  --------------------------------------------------------  MSE is know Mean Squared Error, it is calculated as the difference of every observation with the mean, squared it and divided by the number of observation.  ---------------------------------------------------  MAE is defined as the Mean Absolute error, it is calculated by the difference of every observation with its mean and find the mode of it then, divided by the number of observation.",True
@neeleshjaiswal4922,2021-06-29T15:11:59Z,7,"diff between R-squared and adj-R-squared:    One pitfall of R-squared is that it can only increase as predictors are added to the regression model. This increase is artificial when predictors are not actually improving the model‚Äôs fit.  To remedy this, a related statistic, Adjusted R-squared, incorporates the model‚Äôs degrees of freedom. hence the difference. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   diff between R-squared and MSE:    We know MSE = (y_true - y_hat)**2 divided by N If we try to normalize this equation, it becomes R-squared. R-squared = 1 - [(y_true - y_hat)**2 / (y_true - y_mean)**2]  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  diff between R-squared and MAE:    MAE = absolute diff between (y_true - y_hat) R - squared = same as above  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  diff between MAE and MSE:  MSE = since it is a squared function hence MSE is a differentiable function and several operaitons can be performed. MAE = it is not differential function. 	  As per defn, it is average of absolute diff b/w y_true and y_hat , hence it does not take into accout the direction",True
@ebrain1010,2021-06-29T14:54:22Z,6,R^2 will help  us to see how the line is best fitted to the points mse and mae show how much the line is not fitted example: R^2 is like accuracy and mse and mae are like cross-entropy in classification problems am I right sir?,True
@jayanthnani8022,2021-06-29T14:53:15Z,5,R^2 value can increase if the number of features increase even though they are not useful but adjusted R^2 wont pose any such problems,True
@normalhuman6260,2021-06-29T14:51:12Z,3,Jeez. I think I took the interview. Had asked similar questions.,True
