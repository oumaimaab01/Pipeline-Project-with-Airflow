@subashbarik6871,2023-04-24T03:40:06Z,0,"SEZ employees really need an organisation which will fight for their issues, take things to court, even force gov. to take action or change laws.  SEZ employers do whatever they want, it seems like they don't belong to any country or constitution.. bond labourer, unofficially forcing people to work more than 8-9 hours, not releasing employee on time, entering into personal life of employees",True

@niteshsetin,2021-09-25T16:51:37Z,0,"Yes, i really agree with the points here, and i myself got a job offer from a company but they are insisting to join in 45 days which was really not possible. i believe these immediate hiring jobs are for people who are already on notice period and if they get a good candidate then possibly counter offer the bigger package which a candidate might already have during notice period. But at the same time its really frustrating as well, because companies are really not trying to negotiate terms on joining which left me to leave many job offers.",True
@aninsignificantman001,2021-09-17T09:21:58Z,2,"Now this problem is occurring more because Companies know that because of Covid related layoffs , a lot of people are available to work on immediate basis with low salaries due to financial commitments and they are doing their best to exploit the opportunity . They donot want to give higher salaries and wait for 2 months when they can get such a better deal . To these companies , they must remember that if the employees donot feel valued, they will leave as soon as the market improves .",True

@nags7329,2021-09-10T17:28:14Z,1,"3 months is high risk to wait, as candidate will continue shopping for better offer.or gets distracted by calling recruiters.   And the manager wants to have KT overlap between old and new resource.  ""Who can join immediate"" -  A) People with another offer and almost ending notice period willl drop 1st offer and join new bigger offer. B) Those returning to work post maternity or career breaks C) Laid off Candidates D) Contractors with low notice periods E) Freelancers F) People on bench for long G) From companies that allow notice buy-out H) Could not get Visa extension",True

@Vishu-nr1bk,2021-09-10T16:31:29Z,0,"Oftentimes it's a matter of discussion b/w candidate on one side and leaving co and joining co on the other side. If leaving co's insistence on completing notice period in terms of policy and not of specific skills of candidate then SOP stipulates also a penalty clause. In case of special skills cos some times go in favour of candidate. If joining co requires his skills urgently, it may even meet penalty clause of leaving co. This has happened in my co.H/ever candidate need to be smart to push as much as possible to both cos as rightly advised by Mr. Krish....",True

First  of all ,3 months notice itself highly unfair. Second, these companies dont want anyone to leave within 3 months but they expect employees to join within 3 weeks.
