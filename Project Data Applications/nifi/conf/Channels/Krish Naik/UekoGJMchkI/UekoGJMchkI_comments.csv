@BharatPatnawallah,2024-01-14T13:11:23Z,1,Sir biggest hurdle starts after the study . Yours channel has all the abilities to teach everyone. I am learning it too and very satisfied with that. But one and only thing comes into mind that after studying where to apply for internships or fresher jobs. Not getting interview calls is the biggest challenge. I am from sales background done sales in edtech hospitality and real estate. So when it comes to choose domain for data Analyst or data science what to choose? I know am asking more than needed but please make a dedicated session on this pain point.,True
