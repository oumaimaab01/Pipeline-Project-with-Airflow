@shindepratibha31,2020-06-09T02:12:26Z,7,"I feel, steps for regression process can be like this: 1) split the data into train and test. 2) Use train data for cross-validation and find the parameter with min MSE. 3) Use the same parameter over test data and check for the accuracy of different models.",True

@3pandya,2020-05-18T19:18:10Z,2,"Hi. I just want to know if I am not wrong, we need to use train_test_split method before training the data. right? But you trained the data and then split the data into train & test, which for sure do not give us an accurate prediction on future predictions.   Please correct me if I am wrong.   Thank you.",True
@nagashishsv843,2020-05-18T12:03:09Z,0,sir if i use cv=10 then the mse is coming still less..so how to chose the cv value appropriately..??will it depends upon the dataset..??,True

@yadavsanderamniwas,2020-04-13T12:27:43Z,1,I have a question. what do you mean by stable in the last ses distplot graphs? both ridge and lasso looks same to me. how is one more stable than other,True

@Kumar-oh2jl,2020-03-27T18:39:22Z,3,I think the good example for regularization would be to show that model's accuracy on training data is excellent and accuracyon test data is bad i.e- overfitting; then we can use  regularization and compare the results,True
@esakkiponraj.e5224,2020-03-25T14:27:29Z,5,A small suggestion --- better differentiate the terms -  alpha (for Lassa) and lambda (for ridge). It is confusing.,True

@alakshendrasingh3425,2020-03-04T11:06:53Z,40,You have already trained the model with whole data at first then splitting it for the prediction. Nothing wrong but I don't think so its an ideal technique.,True

Krish, If possible can you please explain the machine learning algorithms as like you explained as linear regression algorithm. I Mean to say, theoretical explanation of the all the important machine learning algorithms. thank you",True
@MrPiickel,2020-02-04T22:33:14Z,5,"Is the method correct? In my understanding we should: 1.  split up the data train and test.set (maybe - depends on data units -  standardize before) 2. do the hyperparameter optimization on the train set with cv-> best model for training data 3. predict with best model on the test set -> realistic result for unseen data   you did: 1. hyperparameter optimization on all data using cross validation -> best model for all data 2. split up all data in training and test set 3. predict with best model on test set -> in my opinion your  ""best model"" has already seen the data in the test set. Hence the result should not be quit realistic. What do you think?",True
@madhu1987ful,2020-01-18T18:39:30Z,1,Krish  Just the video I wanted to see how ridge and lasso can be used in Python. Thanks a ton  Can u pls explain what is the inference from last 2 dist plots...I didn't get,True
