@ritikkohad5045,2023-07-21T09:30:48Z,3,For the people who are getting confused between cosine similarity and cosine distance. In cosine similarity if the value is towards 1 then it would be considered as very similar. If the value is towards 0 then there is no or less similarity between the two points or vectors. In the video at 26:50 Krish sir is  talking about cosine distance not cosine similarity. So in cosine distance if the value is more towards 0 then there is a similarity between the points or vectors and vice versa.,True
@akshayshendre7408,2023-07-18T05:56:59Z,0,"Thank you Krish, really grateful for the video. I have learnt almost everything from your videos. However sometimes it is really difficult to understand the context between the lines and sometimes you say self contradictory things. Similarly here it was difficult to understand the use of O/P feature (Is, related, to ) and the o/p layer of ANN which again without context again comes down to the words in document. please try to elaborate in a sequential model. Maybe its just me who is facing the issue to understand and maybe this comment will get ignore all together. But thanks for the efforts. I will try to browse word2vec for better understanding. I have gone through each community session of ML and deep learning and now I am on NLP. I am following the roadmap you have suggested. I am also in between a career transition from core disease and biology research to data science. Hopefully I will be able to make a successful transition. Keep the good word going for people like me...",True
