@jaychauhan2933,2024-05-31T07:43:42Z,0,"Hi Krish,  Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge through your videos. They have been incredibly helpful in my learning journey. I appreciate all the effort you put into them. I have a few questions that I believe will also benefit the community:  Best Practices for Deployment: What are the best practices for deploying an open-source LLM (Large Language Model) to handle multiple requests from different users simultaneously?  Handling Multiple Requests: How can I deploy an open-source LLM to efficiently handle many requests from different users at the same time?  Reducing Response Time: What strategies can I use to reduce the response time of the deployed LLM?  Accuracy with RAG Implementation: How can I check the accuracy of an LLM model when using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation?  Creating Instruction-Response Pairs: How can I convert raw text into instruction and response pairs for fine-tuning models like Mistral, LLaMA, or any other open-source model?  I believe a video addressing these questions and providing solutions would be very helpful for the community.  Thank you once again for your support and guidance.  Best regards, Jay",True
