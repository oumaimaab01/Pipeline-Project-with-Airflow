@cptfalcon3647,2021-11-14T04:32:12Z,1,"There are a lot of problems here. First, you only have an output of 1 value? So you're only predicting one value step into the future? Its very likely the neural network just learns to give a result close to the previous result. That will look good in evaluation, but there is also way too much variations for any one day prediction to be useful or reliable. Feeding the prediction back into itself to see further into the future will lead to terrible performance without teacher forcing.  The training here also makes no sense. You normalized the data without making the data stationary. Its likely the performance will get worse the higher the price goes because now its out of range for the min max scale. If you include more data from the past which is much smaller it will also be disregarded because its too close to 0. The network is also unnecessarily large and deep and training this model will be SLOW. This will likely overfit over time with to much training. It only looks at price too which is quite a simplification.  Unfortunately, this will simply not be useful for making any sort of real prediction.",True
