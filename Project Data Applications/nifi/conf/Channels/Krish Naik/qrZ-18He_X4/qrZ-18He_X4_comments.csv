@orangetoes223,2024-02-22T07:42:14Z,53,Chai is the peak of this kind of AI app. There’s basically unlimited options. You can pretty much live out a D&D campaign. It doesn’t try to censor you which is easily my favorite thing about it. It’s weird how so many apps like these don’t even treat their users like adults. Bots are surprisingly good at juggling multiple characters and even giving each of them personality. Also the memory is great. It’s hard to say how much of it is the technology at play or my own imagination but Chai seems is particularly impressive to me. AI is amazing technology begin with but Chai is easily the most entertaining. I really hope the company is successful and sets an example for what users actually want from AI.,True
