In false positive case, a person should end up with spending money for further examination/treatment(s) even though actually it is not necessary. such unnecessary treatments can cause risks.    In the case of covid like diseases, a model must equally avoid false positive also as covid hospitalisation can easily drain large sum of money.",True
