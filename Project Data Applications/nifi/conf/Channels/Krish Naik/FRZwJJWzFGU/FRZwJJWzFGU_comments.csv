@vidyakar2292,2021-05-21T15:26:53Z,2,I certainly doubt abt this career transition tag line.... If a person is from a non-IT background and have several years of experience in non-IT background and then he shifts into data science then u can say it as a transition.....but here ppl who is a fresher he can't mention it as transition instead he chose data science as a career since he has no prior experience.... Also krish would mention always Non-technical background for mech n civil people... So these fields seem non technical?,True
