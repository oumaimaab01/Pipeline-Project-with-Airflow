@muzaffarahmed4515,2021-11-29T18:11:18Z,0,I have taken applied ai course. There you need to complete 30 Assignments in 1 year. Most of the Assignments are really very tough to solve. Some of the Assignments can't be handle by those who are new to Data Science . They don't give much focus on deployment. So take applied ai course or not. Two things you should do. First thing is do excessive research on course . Second thing is Are you able to handle such tough Assignments or not? Three most important factors you need to check. First is percentage of students who completed all 30 Assignments ( who completed course) out of all admitted students. Second is percentage of students who got placed through Applied ai course out of all the students who completed the course Third is percentage of students who got placed through Applied ai course out of all students who got admitted,True

Right now I'm trying dataquest, its very good for hand practice. They provide certificate too but they don't teach the fundamental.  concepts much.  Right now I'm thinking of trying macromaster by university of San Diego and something on Coursera. I also watched ML lectures by MIT freely available on YouTube. These lectures are awesome. So if somebody feel MIT macromaster tough or expensive, one can opt for a single course also out of their full macromaster. This could be machine learning to deep learning.
