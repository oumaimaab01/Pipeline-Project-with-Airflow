@varshajoshy6010,2023-02-18T19:17:56Z,0,"Hi Krish,  Could you please show a live project (classification) where dataset contains multiple records for a single key with different features?  for example :  1.predicting fradulent txns on debit cards -  in real world data, same card might be having multiple txns in a single day ; one txn might have initiated from country india and another txns might have initiated from US within a span of 1 hour. So this is actually falls under fraduelent category.  Multiple txns with same card declined with wrong pin - this also suspect as fraudulent.  2.predict how promotion will affect employee engagement in office work - this dataset contains multiple records for a single employee with different activities   So far all live coding having data where a single record is present and we need to predict/classify. But in real word scenarios , dataset might be having these kind of records where (I assume we need to do some group by actions and make a precise dataset before training)  Thank You!",True
