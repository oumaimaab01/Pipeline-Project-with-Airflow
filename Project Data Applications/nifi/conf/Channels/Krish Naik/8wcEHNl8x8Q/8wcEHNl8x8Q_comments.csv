I was experiencing the bumpy ride and then when I decided to switch or make a transition to the data science. Honestly, I thought it will be a piece of cake I will cover it in few weeks but it was already 3 months and I was in a huge mess.I started working with kaggle too few days back and was trying to solve few of them I was really amazed there is soo much yet to learn meanwhile I was in mid of some hackathon too in my company only and when I was like I need to learn something fruitful and good yielding algos and tricks. Last week my friend suggest me to watch Krish Naik videos for Random forest as I was experiencing some difficulties. I immediately started watching and in no time I was watching all the other algorithms as well. The videos are the really amazing guiding path, I feel much more confident now I recently watched the interview tips video and I guess I am going to follow the same path .

Theory regarding any topic (even if it is sparsely related to DataScience) is important. Cause the depth in theory allows critical thinking, but that said there is something which is far more important. It is called Intuition. Intuition is the biggest gap any strong AI will absolutely wish to reach. Intuition allows you to decide which way to proceed even when you barely know anything about the topic (example: think about what would you do if you see a snake in the middle of the road). What I am really excited about is this book by Abhishek. I have been closely following him for a long time now. And I think this book will definitely help a lot of budding Data Scientists to fine tune their hyperparameter called Intuition. I would love to read a copy of this book.

Thanks Krish and Abhishek for the insights about Kaggle and I am really interested to read the book, because most of the people know ML algorithms but where to use which one and how to use it is a big question faced by most of us entering this field. If person doesn't has experience in respective field it's always better to listen to the domain experts and follow there footprints. I was planning for career transition into data science since 2017 but was not able to get proper resource to look refer to learn and look into for solutions, fortunately last year I came across your channel Krish and I must say I am able to solve ML problems quite well and now planning to learn Deep learning concepts. You are really creating great content for your channel viewers and always keep it up! Thanks for all ur content.  (sanket.m88@live.com)",True

@srivatsav2699,2020-06-07T04:43:38Z,0,"Hello Krish and Abhishek. I have a quick question. Data science is getting bigger and bigger everyday. There are new libraries being developed every day, most of the typical things a data scientist does is being automated. So what defines a data scientist in the coming years. The most important quality which couldn't be replaced for a data scientist?  P.s : By the way thank you, Krish and Abhishek sir, for contributing so much to the data science community. I would be glad if I would get a copy of abhisek sir's book. Would want to get a different perspective towards my career. (Email: srivatsavsv23@gmail.com).üòá",True
@amitkumarjena3184,2020-06-07T04:43:35Z,1,"I am not sure about how much we directly use Machine Learning Algorithms in Data Science Jobs. Most Data Scientists say that majority of their time is spent on Data Cleaning and Pre-processing.   But Kaggle actually helped me in doing Applied NLP Research! By learning the best methods to implement deep learning methods from Kagglers, I was able to learn a lot more and implemented many research papers for my projects.   I will be really happy and indebted if I get a free copy of Mr. Abhishek's booküòÖüòç. My mail: amitjena40@gmail.com",True

@saurabhjain507,2020-06-07T04:30:48Z,1,Applied is more important than theory. This is what comes to my mind when I hear Abhishek Thakur. This guy dropped out of his PhD and focused on applied machine learning. You name the competition and Abhishek has been involved either in the kernel or the discussion forums. I am super excited that he is launching his book. What can be better than learning from the expert himself. He is condensing his knowledge that he gained over the years on kaggle in his book. Looking forward to it.,True
