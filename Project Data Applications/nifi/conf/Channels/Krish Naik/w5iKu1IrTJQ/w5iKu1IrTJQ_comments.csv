@alextjflorida,2021-11-29T21:15:18Z,0,Thank you for the video. It seems Python is not efficient in running statistical tests. You have to get one single test results by taking too many steps. Other software packages can do a better job in this department.,True

@badiyabhargav8597,2021-06-10T06:29:01Z,1,Sir I have doubt..  At 11:42 u said that chi2_statistic should always be greater than critical value then only we retain null hypothesis  but in the code our  chi2_statistic value smaller than critical  value   in if condition u gave   if(chi2_statisti>=critical value):          print(reject ho and accept h1 there is a relation) else:          print(retain ho there is no relation)  I think we have to reject the ho null hypothesis  if chi2_statistic is greater than critical value,True

After your z test and T test video, i tried doing some hypothesis test.  Here is my example and would need your help if i am doing it wrong.  I have a file with 5000 rows  And i am considering as a population and i have assuming hypothesis.  Null Hypothesis as age <= 30 years employees are leaving company Alternative Hypothesis age > 30 This is one tailed test.  So here is my question do i need create a sample from population or else i need filter age >=30 and consider it as sample?  And if z score table 1.694 and z test gave 3.54 the do i need reject null hypothesis? Please kindly help me.",True
