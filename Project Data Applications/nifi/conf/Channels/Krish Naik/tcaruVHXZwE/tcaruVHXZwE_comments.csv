@sathwickreddymora8767,2020-08-19T13:41:36Z,0,"Let's assume we are use a MSE cost function Gradient Descent -> It takes all the points into account for computing the derivatives of the cost function w.r.t each feature which tells the right direction to move. It is not productive if we have a large number of data points. SGD -> It computes the derivatives of the cost function w.r.t each feature based a single or some subset of data points and moves in that direction pretending it was the right direction. So, it decreases much of the computational complexity.",True

@ShivShankarDutta1,2020-03-21T09:19:25Z,10,"GD: Run all samples in training to do a single update for all params in a specific iteration SGD: Only one or subset of training sample  from training set to update parameter in a specific iteration GD: If sample/features are larger  it takes much time in updating the values SGD: It is faster because there is one training sample SGD conveges faster than GD.",True

@bharathjc4700,2020-03-20T17:52:55Z,7,"multicollinearity may not be a problem every time. The need to fix multicollinearity depends primarily on the below reasons:  When you care more about how much each individual feature rather than a group of features affects the target variable, then removing multicollinearity may be a good option If multicollinearity is not present in the features you are interested in, then multicollinearity may not be a problem.",True
@bharathjc4700,2020-03-20T17:49:31Z,2,"In batch gradient descent, you compute the gradient over the entire dataset, averaging over potentially a vast amount of information.  It takes lots of memory to do that. But the real handicap is the batch gradient trajectory land you in a bad spot (saddle point).  In pure SGD, on the other hand, you update your parameters by adding (minus sign) the gradient computed on a single instance of the dataset.  Since it's based on one random data point, it's very noisy and may go off in a direction far from the batch gradient.  However, the noisiness is exactly what you want in non-convex optimization, because it helps you escape from saddle points or local minima GD theoretically minimizes the error function better than SGD. However, SGD converges much faster once the dataset becomes large.That means GD is preferable for small datasets while SGD is preferable for larger ones..",True
@ShubhanshuAnand,2020-03-20T17:44:03Z,0,SGD: Picks k random sample from n samples in each iteration whereas GD considers all n samples.,True
@DionysusEleutherios,2020-03-20T17:14:09Z,2,"If you have a a large feature space that contains multicollinearity, you could also try running a PCA and use only the first n components in your model (where n is the number of components that collectively explain at least 80% of the variance), since they are by definition orthogonal to each other.",True

@sahubiswajit1996,2020-03-20T16:17:55Z,0,"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): It means we are sending ONLY ONE DATA POINT (Only one row) for the training phase.

@mahender1440,2020-03-20T15:28:03Z,3,"Hi, Krish Gradient descent : on big volume of data it takes more number of iterations,for each iteration it works with entire data so casuses High latency and more computing power, Solution : batch gradient Batch gradient : data is splitted into multiple batches,on each batch gradient will be applied separately,for each batch separate minimum loss is achieved,it considers finally the weight matrix of global minimum loss Problem with batch gradient : each batch contains few patterns the entire data,that means missing other patterns,model couldn't learn all patterns from the data",True
