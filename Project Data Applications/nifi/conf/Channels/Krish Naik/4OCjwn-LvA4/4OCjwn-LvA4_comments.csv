@tricksmath8113,2021-06-02T06:26:31Z,0,"Distribution gives us the pattern of data and once we know this , then it helps us  to analyze data.",True
@ashishmanusmare6011,2021-05-27T06:25:38Z,1,"Distrubution is mainly used to remove the outlier in the dataset. as per the imperical formula almost 99 % data fall within  three standard deviation, so the data after the 3 deviation in left and right  will be termed as outliers. let me correct if i am wrong.",True

@nikhilshingadiya7798,2020-07-17T17:35:50Z,0,Why we use distribution? Because we want to figure out in this particular data how many possible variability occur in terms of frequency,True

@raviirla459,2020-03-27T09:36:29Z,2,"what is the use of distribution ?  To understand the data, knowing distribution of the data is very importent. when we say say distribution of data it has some mean an standard deviation. when we know it the data is in normal distribution then we can say 66.23% of data in +-1 sigma, 95.44% in +-2 sigma, +-3 sigma.  Also we will understand is there any skewness in data so that we can apply some transformation techniques (Log, power law transformations) to bring the data to normal distriution.",True
@raneshmitra8156,2020-03-25T15:14:57Z,10,"Hi Kris, Kindly upload videos on 1.Symmetric Distribution, Skewness and Kurtosis  2.Bernoulii and Binomial Distribution 3. Power Law Distribution 4. Box-cox Transform",True
@surajkhanna1129,2020-03-25T13:10:15Z,3,"If we have a random varaible X=throwing a die so my x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and the probability of each outcome is 1/6 So when I plot this using distribtion, I take probabilites on Y-axis and the ouctomes(1,2,3,4,5,6) on X-axis. So the distribution tells the occurence of each Outcome, beacuse each outcome holds some specific probability(chance to occur) For the above example its a uniform distribution, thats is each outcome has to probability to occur eqal number of times.   The other use of distribution is, it also helps to visaulize the data, is it skewed, normally distributed, or binomial and other types of distributions in nature. It also heps in checking the spread of data Visually,if the curve is stretced or it is more attached",True
@indranilpaul8328,2020-03-25T09:58:13Z,5,Hi all my name is Krish Naik...üòÅü§£üòÇ,True
@surajkumarpradhan667,2020-03-25T09:52:43Z,12,"Distribution helps us know about the occurance of the output i.e what is the frequency of the outcome variables which in turn will let us know the interval or range within which maximum data lies also helps us to know the points which might be an outlier, For ex 68-95-99.7 rule tells us about the percentage of values that lied within a particular band.",True
@rameshkokati,2020-03-25T09:51:19Z,1,@krishnaik----kindly let us know....do you teach classes in ineuron program....we are about to enroll that....please do suggest,True
@mlbasics6267,2020-03-25T09:31:28Z,3,@krishnaik - Could you please let us know how to study Linear algebra\calculus that is required to learn indepth about models? like till what depth? could you please privide any sources to study them?  probably a separate playlist would be great :d,True
