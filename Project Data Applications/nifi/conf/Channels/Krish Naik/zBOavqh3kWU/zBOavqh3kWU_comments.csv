Sir, can you please go through this link -  https://github.com/osanseviero/Dog-Breed-Classifier/blob/master/dog_app.ipynb in this transfer learning has been applied in the last section of the program, they are using some .npz file,  but i am not able to understand why so, can you please explain how is it done...Thanks in advance",True

@thevivekmathema,2020-05-05T15:52:43Z,0,very good information....thank you,True
@MithileshDSCS,2020-04-27T14:11:25Z,0,hey Krish could you like maybe post a video as to how to import and use data sets used for cnns and image classification in Colab? Because it is not a simple csv file and has different folders so accessing and using them is hard. Would really help as other tutorials only use cifar and mnist which are already pre loaded into keras. So yeah!!,True
