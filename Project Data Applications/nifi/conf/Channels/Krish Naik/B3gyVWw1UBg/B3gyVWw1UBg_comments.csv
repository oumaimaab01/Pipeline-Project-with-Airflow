@shyamsundarramadoss3567,2020-08-29T16:45:28Z,0,"Hi. I see lots of pre-processing and processing steps involved in modelling. Is there any generic steps in order to do provided if needed. I meant can you pls provide a sequence in which steps like the following has to be done to get the well performant model from the lot??  missing values treatment polynomial features addition scaling normalization correlation / multicollinearity check pca/lda/da/fa  dimension reduction modelling cross validation hyper-param tuning  (grid/random search) model calibration report generation  is the above order correct in sequence and is there any of the above steps which can be switched if needed and what all steps have strictly need to be in the specified order? Can you pls elaborate on this? Above was thought of from a regression problem standpoint, even though maybe some of them might apply to classification as well.",True
