@adityay525125,2020-02-09T12:12:43Z,0,"I know this might be unrelated, but I am purchasing a new laptop for college that I believe is supposed to last for a long time, maybe 4 to 5 years at least. I prefer the ultrabook form factor, as still, I am learning all things related to ML and AI. I have plans to purchase the Tensorbook by Lambda labs sometime down the line, but till then I need a workable Laptop for a learner. I narrowed it down to two choices within my budget of 1 Lac INR (1390 USD)   they are the specter x360 with 8gb of RAM and the Dell Inspirion 7000 series with 16 GB of RAM, technically they both are trash for hardcore ML, but if you guys were in my position which one would you choose. I already run a few of my projects on GCS and Collab anyways, but still, need an opinion.   Here are the product links for your review.   https://store.hp.com/in-en/default/hp-spectre-x360-13-aw0204tu-9jb01pa.html   https://www.compuindia.com/new-inspiron-13-7391-2-in-1-laptop-7391716512ibt.html   I am inclined to get the HP one but scared as 8GB of RAM might be a little on the lower side right? personally I code on the Acer Nitro 5 and the X220 right now.",True
