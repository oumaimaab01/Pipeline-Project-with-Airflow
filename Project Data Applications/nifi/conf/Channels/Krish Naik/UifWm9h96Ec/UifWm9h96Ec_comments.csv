@ankursingh5297,2024-03-10T10:24:18Z,0,"Hi Krish, I have a question for which I am not able to find an answer anywhere. These are concepts like ""Statistical Analysis of Data"" and use of basic and advanced statistics concepts while analyzing data. But I am not able to find any video or article as how these concepts are implemented in actual companies on real world data. For eg. suppose we have a dataset having data on alerts generated on trading activity of various customers, where, as per implemented logic, system will generate data having all the trading details and a column will tell us whether for this particular row an alert was generated or not. Now the company want us to study the data and do some advanced statistical analysis to understand the distribution and all. Then want us to clean the data and then want us to provide them some solutions as how to reduce the number of false positives for alerts generated.   Now we as data analysis students don't know exactly how these kind of steps are being implemented in industry and don't know how to solve assignments like these. Can you please explain something similar to this in a detailed video, as what are the steps and processes that are actually being implemented at Industry level?",True
