@ankitchouhan8828,2021-03-09T08:54:43Z,0,Great Explanation. But I have a concern. Accuracy is not always the best measure of model performance. We are getting accuracy around 86% which seems pretty good but looking at the confusion matrix we can say that the model is not good. It is predicting large number of True Negatives and False Positives which will not be acceptable in real world cases.,True
