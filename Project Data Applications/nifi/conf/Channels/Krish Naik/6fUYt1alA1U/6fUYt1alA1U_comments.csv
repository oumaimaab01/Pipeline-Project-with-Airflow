@sgoel0101,2019-10-18T20:12:29Z,0,"Hey, Krish just a small doubt. The absolute value of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient cannot exceed 1, so for extreme cases (1, -1) that basically means that if one variable is increasing by some percentage, then another variable will also increase by that. But what about exponential functions? We know if one increases then other increase multifold times and not 1. So what would be the Coefficient value in that case?",True

@muhammadzubairbaloch3224,2019-09-13T15:24:46Z,2,please make some videos on reinforcement learning,True
@kranthikumarjorrigala,2019-09-13T13:33:36Z,6,"Hi,  your explanation about concept is nice.  One suggestion from my side is explain how to implement those concept with python after the theory part.  Please make video on tests used to find nonlinear relationship and how to find relationship between categorical dependent variable and multiple categorical and continuous independent variables.  This would help many people I guess. Thanks for useful content.",True
@marius5361,2019-09-12T21:44:41Z,1,on the top right ...isn't x increasing and y decreasing  ? btw nice video !,True
