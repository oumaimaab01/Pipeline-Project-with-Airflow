@lepidoptera9337,2023-01-07T20:08:40Z,0,Exception handling is not an advanced concept. It's also pretty useless in most cases. What an exception usually tells you is that you made a software design mistake. For bugs that you can anticipate it can be used as a catch-all debugging tool. Good design never even gets into that kind of mess. The main scenarios where you absolutely need exceptions are if have to work with incomplete APIs that do not let you guarantee correctness by design (i.e. other people's bad software design) and then in situations that change in real-time in which the code can never anticipate what will happen.,True

@divyanshusharma4459,2021-04-29T09:09:04Z,3,error =  We take error as the program syntax is gonna wrong somewhere or something.
