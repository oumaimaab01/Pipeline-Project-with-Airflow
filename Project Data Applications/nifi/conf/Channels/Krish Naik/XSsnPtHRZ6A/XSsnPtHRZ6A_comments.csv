@jamesrobisnon9165,2023-12-24T01:49:37Z,0,5:40: 9% is not accuracy. It is actually the error in predicting a purchase while there was no purchases. So it should not be high but actually it should be low. 91% is accurate and 9% is not. The same for predicting ourchase which has accuracy of 66% and error or 34%.,True
