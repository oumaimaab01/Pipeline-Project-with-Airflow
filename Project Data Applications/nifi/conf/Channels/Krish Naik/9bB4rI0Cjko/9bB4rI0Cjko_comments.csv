@tanishasharma3665,2021-01-23T10:35:26Z,0,"There are a few tier 3 colleges which do not even maintain an efficient management system. Moreover, neither they are able to get companies nor they  allow final years to do internships on their own(through referrals) solely because of '75% mandatory attendance' . So, there are always exceptions who use Covid as a leverage for not being able to get jobs/internships even when, ironically, our seniors of 2018 and 2019 batch are sitting jobless at home, after paying 8-9lakhs as college fees.",True

@vahiagyat,2021-01-17T13:12:45Z,8,"Totally agree with Krish. When people tell me these things my simple question to them is - ""Do you want to keep crying over what you didn't or don't have OR you want to make effort to make your future better?"" It's that simple! Whatever problem was there genuine or your excuse but it had already happened. Now, what options you have? We don't have a time machine yet - so can't go back and change things. So, the only feasible option is to do things now that will make your future better otherwise again 2 -5 years down the lane you will be crying if I had done this at that time things would have been different. This is applicable to any situation. Yes, being in tier-1 college does help. I prefer the marathon analogy in this respect. Life is not a 100 meters race but a marathon. Being from a tier-1 college can give you, maybe, 50 meters ahead start. IF you are looking for short-term accomplishments such as the first job CTC then in most cases yes the one from tier-1 has an advantage (though not always - there are students who have done great wonders even without a proper college education).  But in long term, you have ample opportunities to overtake him/her. Though I am not a big fan of such competition - just giving an example as most people are used to compare themselves with the others. Instead of this, it will be better if we have our own goal defined be it money wise or profile wise (just talking with respect to jobs, not life in general). And there is no shame in having a money-oriented goals. I see many students/people giving philosophical answers because in Indian society we have been trained this way to be money-oriented is bad! ( in the majority of the middle class - not directly but indirectly). Anyway coming back to the original topic - being from a tier-3 college may put you 50 meters behind - so you need to put an extra effort and work hard to cover this gap. I have seen lots of students and have lots of friends from tier-1,2,3 colleges and after 8 years of jobs, now it hardly matters who came from IIT Bombay or Kharagpur or who came from LPU or VTU colleges. In fact, I have seen the other way around. One of my friend didn't get in very good college so he put an extra effort in off-campus and gave more than 15 interviews in a row. He didn't confine himself to the on-campus opportunities and this I am talking about 2011-12, now things have become much better. Yes, he started at lower ctc but his determination and hard work paid off - he learned whatever he worked on in-depth (believe me most of us in the IT industry just completes our works NOT really go in-depth of the things and understand it in and out). He switched to another company and the next switch was a big e-commerce company and his ctc was well above 20 in the first 3 years. I have various similar examples recently someone switched from ctc of 8 to 30+ in Walmart (he also doesn't come from tier-1 college). Anyway, the bottom line is you have to put in extra effort and have patience.   Spend time working towards your goal rather than crying over what you don't have or didn't have. And if you really feel you are at disadvantage then pickup google and search or maybe just look around yourself. You will find so many people who are in much much much worse condition than yourself but still, they are not making those things stop them. I have so many examples but won't bore with those stories, maybe in some blog I can put all these to motivate people because people like actual anecdotes.   And many people ask me or here also are asking - not from tech background what to do? Whoever reached out to me, I have answered them in detail as per their profile or given some references who have made similar transitions. Wil briefly mention it here else this comment will become an article! :P  Non tech background comes in two categories: 1> Engineering but not CS/IT 2> Non-engineers BA,Commerce etc.  See, above is degree wise category. But what I prefer is a knowledge-wise categorization (for preparation): 1>You know about data science and software engineering. For example one of my cousins - was in minings but he did a side project in Java. So, even though he was not from tech background he had a fair understanding of tech and had a knack for programming. 2> You have no clue about data science but have done some small crash course in some programming language or you know some basics about coding. Mech or Civil guy who just studies 'C' in the first sem but never opened it again. Or some commerce student (one of my friend she did a course in NIIT in Java - yes when I was in college Java was a kind of defacto language to learn) but then didn't practice much and became an accountant. 3> You have no clue about the software industry, tech, programming language, etc.   Why I categorize people ethis way because it help me to suggest a feasible plan for them. I was recently talking to a girl from non-tech background falling in third category. Now, it will be unrealistic if I suggest to her that in 6 months she can be ready for a data science interview.  One thing I forgot - my first question to all these people especially someone who has no clue about software, DS etc.  is ""WHY?"". THE WHY is very important - why you want to transition to DS. This why tells you how much effort and passion that person has for making the shift. Many of the people reply to me 'because it's a hot job nowadays and getting paid handsomely' - it is okay if you want to make a switch for money but do you really like whatever you know about DS and if you don't about DS then why do you want to make switch? Because like any other field - it requires dedication to excel and if you don't excel then you won't be getting that high pay for which you switched in the first place - you will get a job and will be doing good (even if you don't excel excel in it). If you have a strong 'why' then it becomes easy to stick to the plan.  Post these things - decide a timeline. Let's say 1 year. then plan to finish the syllabus by 9 months and keep the last 3 months for revising and interview prep. I have seen many people good with tech but not prepared for an interview  - they get nervous or  not able to explain in clear and concise manner or having a language barrier. And then many don't come prepared for the company - when you go for an interview even if it's just a developer role - read about that company. When asked the question do you know this company then don't just say not really - I have got that answer many times. Then it gives an impression you didn't even put an effort into knowing about the company where you are going to work then how much effort you will put in the job! So spend last 3 months searching , applying and practicing.  Prior to that breakdown the whole syllabus into smaller milestones. Le's say Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning etc. Then further break it down. And keep something which you can achieve in 2 weeks. LEt's say you plan 2 weeks for regression - then keep 30-40% in theory and rest of the time spend in implementing what you learnt. MAke sure to add in GitHub and share on social media - LinkedIn etc. And there are various blog sites - you can write down what you learned. Benefit of this? One of my professor told me once - if you want to know if you have understood something try teaching that to someone who doesn't know it or to a kid and if you are able to explain it to them then that means you have really understood it. So if you write a blog - while writing only you will know your weak points and post that once published many people will read it and they can point out the mistakes too. Don't be afraid of making mistakes - one who makes mistakes can only correct it. One who never wrote it or tried it can never correct it.  Why have 2 weeks goal because that way you can track your progress quickly - if you are off the track within 2 weeks you will know and can work to fix it. If you keep big milestones such as in 3 months I will finish 'X' syllabus then only after 3 months you will have time to fix it and also, you will get a little laid back thinking you have 3 months to complete.   While doing all this make sure to network. Reach out to people from DS field and talk to them, and also connect with people who are making a transition similar to you. Networking helps you a lot - it's known and shared at many places - about 2/3 of jobs comes via referrals,connections etc. they are not put out in Naukri kind of job portal (straight away). And spend some time in preparing the syllabus for your plan don't just put the stuffs which are fancy but not much used in all the DS jobs for example GANs - very good and I love them but majority of DS jobs at least when you are starting doesn't require knowledge of GAN. So when you have limited time focus on the important topics not just fancy ones!  If you follow your plan then you can for sure achieve your goal. Just make a feasible plan and stick to it.
