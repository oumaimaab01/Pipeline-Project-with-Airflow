@rohit.m.somani4157,2021-09-10T08:54:54Z,2,"To be  honest I believe seeing the obsession towards brand tags , these companies just put forth a fancy CTC which in reality differs a lot. Most ppl don't differentiate b/w ctc and lpa, as such companies just include huge  ESOPS/RSU's which actually are paid in the latter years but included in the initial CTC. Amazon includes 12 lpa worth ESOPS in it's compensation for freshers 80% of which r paid in the 3rd nd 4th years.Even a portion of the joining bonus is paid in 2nd year",True

@Nick-vi4rj,2021-09-09T19:17:13Z,4,"Good advice. Relevant in industries outside of software as well - engineering, business and finance, etc.   As a lot of older/experienced often say, ""some experience is better than no experience"". Better to have *something* under your belt first. First job is always the hardest to get anyway.  And as you said ""you don't know what will happen tomorrow"". Who knows, you might end up liking working at this ""not as good / non-FAANG"" role. Might even end up wanting to do something *entirely* different in a year or two. Life happens",True
