@David-dy2wx,2020-07-11T19:38:38Z,1,"Krish, firstly thanks for all you do to give back to the DS community. Your videos are helping me make the career transition. I know statistics is important for DS and so I found this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28) from FreeCodeCamp on statistics to do and I was considering working through it and the corresponding textbook  to gain a better understanding of stats. But after watching your video titled 'The Role of Maths in Data Science and How to Learn?' I am unsure if I should work through the textbook as well? I have a lot to learn at the moment (Python programming) and maybe this is unnecessary? Likewise it seems like taking any courses focussed on learning the concept (eg maths) without applying it to projects is a waste of time. What I think you were saying is learnt the maths and stats by reverse engineering the algorithms you need for projects.  Please let me know what you think.",True
