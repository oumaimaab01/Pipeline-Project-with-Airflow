@manojrangera5955,2021-08-30T17:35:57Z,0,Sir i have 1 question if my target features  is not in Gaussian distribution but some kind of skewed like this house dataset.. So after transform target feature into log transform it became Gaussian so i have to used transform target in my ml model yaa without transform?... Please answer it.. I am bit of confused.. I saw somewhere there  target was transform me then used that target into ml model.. Please answer anyone who know about it.. 🙏🙏🙏,True
@manojrangera5955,2021-08-30T17:31:59Z,0,He took log transform features in outlier because without log transformation features distribution was not in Gaussian  Form.. But after taking it . It converts features distribution kind of Gaussian .. So in model we will use transform feature instead  without transform features so.. Need to detect outliers in log transform feature.... Am I correct?..  I feel this is right... Correct me if I am wrong...,True

I have some questions regarding your EDA, I'd appreciate it if you reply 'em: 1. why did you take the log before detecting outliers? it's a practice I've never seen before. 2.why didn't you apply Isolation Forest instead of the box plot, there are at least 2 upsides to it vs box plots, it will find outliers based on the relationship of multi-variables and by opting the right parameter it possible to get the index of outliers which is not possible in box plots. 3.why not using the correlation matrix at least for continuous variables (I said it because somehow we can transform categorical variables to numerical by implementing kind of label encoding) since it is kind of high dimensional dataset, and in real projects, it's really time-consuming to explore scatter plots one-by-one.",True
