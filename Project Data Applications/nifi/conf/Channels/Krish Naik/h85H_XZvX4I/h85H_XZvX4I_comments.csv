@sameera1995,2022-01-08T22:54:00Z,1,Hai krish I just visited your ineuron website as you claim that you are into business solutions and education but I can't see a single page where you mention about your company providing business solutions to clients or how. If that is the case the internship doesn't hold any value 2moro any one can build website ask ppl to do some internship which is few project updated in a bucket and get certified. I just want your point on this that if everyone are doing project for the clients disclose the client or certify people with client name entered in certification,True
