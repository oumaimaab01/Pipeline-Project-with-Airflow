@husamjon5971,2023-11-06T03:54:30Z,0,so we do scaling either for ensuring correct results (like K mean algorithms or for efficiency like anyone which uses gradient decent - correct?,True
@pravinacharya4411,2023-06-29T12:17:46Z,0,Do we need to do scaling for time series data and which scaling method would be best,True
@junaidlatif2881,2022-11-19T18:02:04Z,1,Sir. I used my data for RF without scaling. Model performance is worst and in - ve value. Because my Y (output) variable range from 10E14-10E20. I tried many ways. But i found better accuracy when i used standard scaler of Y variable. Other ways my model performance is worst! Still my question is: if i used scaler in RF and ensamble method is it right? Can I use it?,True

@gvsmchaithanya2847,2019-10-01T02:10:40Z,3,Feature Scaling will be applicable to SVM also I think because in that mostly i taken the data set like the binary classification of the dataset like 0 or 1. In this case of that problem and i have also applied min - max scala by using sklearn library. I think my usage of feature scaling what i applied this may correct.,True
