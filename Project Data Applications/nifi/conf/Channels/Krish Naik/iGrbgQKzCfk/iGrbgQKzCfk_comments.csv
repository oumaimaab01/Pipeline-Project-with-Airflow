@AmericanAccentPractice,2021-12-19T01:56:33Z,0,"Hi Krish. I don't agree with accuracy of data example you have provided. If we have 1 million records then the chances of getting inaccurate data decreases actually we will have mixed data accurate as well as inaccurate therefore the chances of a failed ML model will decrease but still the accuracy of the model won't be good enough. What I understand is instead of focussing on model accuracy, we should focus on feature engineering and data cleansing more. Would you agree?",True

@somnathbanerjee2057,2019-10-31T17:21:49Z,1,"Good evening. I have two questions. I'm a data scientist aspirant. I'm struggling with the variable importance part. What could I do in a real-time scenario?  There are various methods out there; such as model-specific metrics(least square, recursive partitioning, random forest) or model-independent metrics(varImp() from caret package). I often use varImp and varImpplot. I have seen, my instructor did that part with vif()<a.k.a variable inflation factor> in a logistic regression case study. So, what approach would I take? I believe a simple model is the best one of all. My second question, regarding Time Series Analysis. I have studied two different ways to remove trend component from time-series data. by implementing square root and by making a difference. Which method is right?",True

@BiancaAguglia,2019-10-31T16:36:45Z,6,"Congratulations on the 50k subscribers. Well deserved. üòä I think another reason ML projects fail is that some people have unrealistic expectations when it comes to what a model is capable of. Also, we sometimes underestimate the amount of time and money needed to keep the models accurate once they've been implemented.",True
