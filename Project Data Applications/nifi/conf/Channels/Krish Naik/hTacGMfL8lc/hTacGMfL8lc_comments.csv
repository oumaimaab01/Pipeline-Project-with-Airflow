@Canada_Facts,2023-04-02T16:25:49Z,0,"Question Krish, I am a newbie and trying to appreciate the importance of the tools.  At timestamp 16:35 you mentioned that docker people have challenges because of env issues.

Is docker only for deployment purpose?",True

@jawedasad,2020-05-16T21:54:15Z,1,"Krish, Very humbly need to disagree on couple of points. 1. Docker is suitable only when developed code OS and testing env OS are being same, i.e, let's say if code is developed on Windows and testing needs to happen on Ubuntu, then Container may not be the right choice as docker processes make use of Host OS on which it's running. In that case VM would be the better choice as each VM has it's own OS whereas docker doesn't. 2. I agree with Environment standardization in case of docker but that doesn't include OS.",True
