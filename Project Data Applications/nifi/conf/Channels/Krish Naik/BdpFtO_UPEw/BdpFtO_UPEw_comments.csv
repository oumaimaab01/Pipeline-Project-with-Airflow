@datacodedesign,2024-02-06T03:05:41Z,5,"I too agree with you here. Students should really start taking their study life seriously as days ahead are going to be very tough. It is okay to be happy when when you solve your first DSA question, it is okay to be happy when you have built your first Web Page, it is okay to be happy when you have completed designing you first ever, full responsive and working app but it is for a fact that, millions of other students, who may be even younger than you have already done it years ago. The competition in the current market has become so huge that it has genuinely become  hard for a student to get a great job based on average skill sets. Students need to polish their skills very a lot and specifically I believe *Personal Projects* are the best way to do so.   *Students expecting high salary should be the ones who are bringing high value to the company* - this is my thought.  Learn - Experiment - Fail - REPEAT!!! Do not stop until you have reached your goal. *ALL THE BEST TO EVERYONE*",True
