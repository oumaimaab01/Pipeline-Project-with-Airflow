@mohammednadhim1918,2024-01-21T02:13:54Z,2,"on 38:00 he was  wrong   here is the answer according to google bard  The image you sent shows two normal distributions. The distribution on the top has a higher variance than the distribution on the bottom. This is because the distribution on the top is wider and more spread out than the distribution on the bottom.  Variance is a measure of how spread out a distribution is. It is the average squared distance of all data points from the mean of the distribution. A higher variance means that the data points are further away from the mean, on average.  In the image, the distribution on the top has a wider spread of data points than the distribution on the bottom. This means that the data points in the left distribution are further away from the mean, on average, than the data points in the right distribution. Therefore, the distribution on the top has a higher variance.",True

@harshmeshram4308,2023-09-28T08:02:53Z,2,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  02:18 📊 Mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency used to find the center of a data distribution. 12:19 📏 Median is robust against outliers and is suitable for datasets with extreme values. 19:56 📈 Mode is useful for categorical variables and finding the most frequent element in a dataset. 26:21 📚 The choice between mean, median, or mode depends on the specific dataset and domain knowledge, considering factors like outliers and data type. 29:25 📉 Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion used to quantify the spread or variability of data points within a distribution. 52:11 📊 Percentiles are values below which a certain percentage of observations lie. 53:07 📈 To calculate the percentile rank of a value, use the formula: (Number of values below x / Total sample size) * 100. 55:07 🧮 To find the percentile ranking of a value, use the formula: Value = (Percentile / 100) * (n + 1). 57:54 🧾 For example, the 25th percentile value in a dataset of 21 elements can be calculated as (25 / 100) * (21 + 1) = 5.25, which corresponds to the 5th element. 01:00:12 🖋️ Pay attention to index positions when finding percentile values in data sets. 01:02:15 📊 The 75th percentile is calculated as 75 divided by 100 multiplied by the number of data points, and it helps identify a specific data point in a dataset. 01:05:25 📉 The process of removing outliers from a dataset involves defining a lower fence and an upper fence based on the interquartile range (IQR). 01:08:08 🧮 The interquartile range (IQR) is computed as the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1) and is used to identify outliers. 01:17:39 📊 Box plots provide a visual representation of the five-number summary, including the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values, helping identify outliers. 01:20:19 📚 The video covers various statistical concepts, including variance and the formula for sample variance, as part of a comprehensive data science course.

@tejeshivsn632,2022-07-14T10:24:34Z,0,"Homework: why do we use n-1 is used in the formula for calculating sample variance instead of n?  To answer this let us understand the difference between the sample mean and population mean. Population mean is the average computed for the entire data and sample mean is the average computed for that particular sample. Therefore there would be some differences between them. the sample mean will be close to the population mean.   Now coming to sample variance and population variance, the difference will be huge between the sum of the squares of the difference between data and sample mean and the sum of squares of (data - population mean). This is due to the small difference between the sample mean and population mean. When it is squared the difference is more. To compensate for the difference we use n-1 in the denominator to increase the value such that the sample variance is closer to the population variance. Why n-1 the value comes closer when we compute considering n-1 than to n-2, n-3, and others.   Happy learning!!",True
