@shubhamkundu2228,2021-05-04T13:45:00Z,0,"So to sum up, to identify multicollinearity, we use OLS (ordinary least squares) method to check the model summary for std error (values should be less not high), Rsquare value (should tend towards 1), p value (should <0.05 ), then also check for correlation (should be < 0.5) between the independent variables and drop the one having higher p value.  Can't we directly just use df.corr() for the dataset and drop the independent variables that are highly correlated?",True
@gargisingh9279,2021-04-30T11:26:28Z,8,@KrishNaik Sir !! What about another technique called as VIF(Variance inflation factor)?That is the technique also used mostly for multicollinearity,True

@karangupta6402,2021-04-08T03:12:43Z,17,"Thanks, Krish. One way that you suggested is to Drop the feature. There is one more thing that we can do is combine the features which we also called them as an interaction term (like multiply Age and years of experience, and then run your OLS model). This also seems to control collinearity to some extent",True
@DataInsights2001,2021-03-17T19:33:39Z,1,"Nice presentation! Dropping a feature is the one solution, sometimes you can’t drop and you may need that feature in the analysis what would you do? Combine features or division or multiplication? Or use factor analysis? Mostly the cases like Marketing Mix modeling the similar issues arise often.
