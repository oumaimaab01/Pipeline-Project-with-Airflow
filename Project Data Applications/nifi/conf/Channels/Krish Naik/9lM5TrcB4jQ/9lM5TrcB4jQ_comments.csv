It's not only with data science but also whatever new learnings that I take up.  I will always start my learning journey and after some time I go off track and loose my focus.

@thesonic4634,2020-03-15T17:44:56Z,2,"I will share an quick review about this laptop.  So I had bought Lenovo legion y540 with maxed out version ,about 1 month ago My specs are  i7 Rtx 2060 1TB ssd no hdd 32 Gb ram   At Rs.1,28,000 from Lenovo exclusive store at Pune .  The laptop is just smooth and really responsive. Alright the display on my unit is 144hz one and it's 1080 but it is really crisp and literally has no complains at all.  The laptop handles Gaming like a champ. I don't play games much ,but yaa I do video editing and Programming alot, alot (I mean it).  So Keyboard layout is one thing I just still couldn't adapt. The arrangements of num keys is just weird and the most important keys for me are home and end keys which are covered under the function and arrows keys which irritates me.  As programmer I prefer external keyboard.  Trackpad is damn responsive. But you have to just clean after use by tissue paper Because it's plastic surface but don't worry it's performance is up to the mark.  So another thing which might interest you is lid can be opened with one finger, Without any effort.  The keyboard has two stage non rgb backlight, which are just more than enough.  Let's talk about performance i7 is up to the mark and the Rtx 2060 is full fledged Card but don't worry about thermals they are great.  The build quality is great enough, yaa it is a plastic build but it's strong enough. It needs to be cleaned frequently to keep it shining.  The lid has a logo of legion branding and a Y shaped Glowing light which could be turned on/off by Fn+L key.  It has a pattern which is really attractive but if the dirt gets on it, I swear you will have tough time to clean it.  Overall , Laptop is great , fast and is suitable for every kind of user.",True
