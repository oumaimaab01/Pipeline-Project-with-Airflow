@marcellodichiera,2022-03-30T18:04:49Z,0,"Well said Krish!! I experimented this on me, I am late data science geek (I am a marketing manager of 40 years old that fell in love with Data science the last 2 years). After having my DS certificate(that is not the ending of the path in DS) and practicing with kaggle datasets ready made where you only have to do a short data cleaning and then apply ML models, I got impacted by what Krish is saying when I decided to help for free (at the moment üòä) one of my friend‚Äôs startup with data analytics/DS. I am spending most of my time acquiring, cleaning, processing data and making EDA, rather than implementing ML predictions etc.. üòä Sometines, (as one of my friend says) a well done EDA makes a client happier than applying a ML prediction model just for the sake of doing it. So for who is in DS, try to have the mindset suggested by Krish and you will enjoy the job, and when you see the client or your employer happy because your EDA gave useful insights, you will appreciate more when you spend 80% of the time acquiring and cleaning data üòäüòä",True

@MrTejbond007,2022-03-30T16:28:47Z,7,"Well reader and also @krish, coming from a senior position, and from advance analytics ND data science background., I would like to add a point, that is, most of the fresher and even senior people should do a Eda process, covering preprocessing, a lot of data analysis which directly connects to a lot of cloud services and web services, then to build a lot of insight tables and charts for poc and client interaction and further advancing the project in cloud where a lot of services are used to further the Eda processed data, but when and only a requirement come, as to further the project in prediction of missing value of to predict some data or value till present data time, it will called as prediction models and algos accuracy and etc we do, but if we are going to predict future value that is data front the now data, it is called a foracast prediction models or predictive machine learning, and then when we get a approval of building ml models, do we build a models and we can use algos or neurals. Or most of the 75% will be to just build a Eda of data and push it to other components like in cloud for example kinesis, Redshift, lake formation or Azure ADF. Or other services. In today's market.",True

@aritratalapatra8452,2022-03-30T15:53:53Z,1,"The problem most data science aspirants have is to strike a balace between programming skills and mathematical foundation. In most cases especially in training courses, they dont teach much about the initial challenges of any data science project. People who has transitioned from non programming background have difficulties understanding how the Data Pipelines are build in enterprise, how the deplyoment is performed etc. as they not have much familiarity with general software engineering. Hence the only thing that they learn is start everything with a csv or excel.",True
