@Xnozea,2024-04-17T14:33:39Z,16,Yesterday I was solving SQL interview questions and ran into an error where I wasn't able to use a simple 'Where' clause. Then I translated this problem to Gemini and it said my query code was OK. Then I realized the word 'returning' was a clause in PostgreSQL. So using 'returning' as a column name gave the error. Gemini could not catch that.   I just want to say that I believe LLMs are great and useful technologies but hyping up AI isn't really helping anyone imho.,True
