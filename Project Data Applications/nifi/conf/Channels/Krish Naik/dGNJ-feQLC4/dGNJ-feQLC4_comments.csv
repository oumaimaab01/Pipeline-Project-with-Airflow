@svitlanatuchyna7154,2024-05-07T10:43:17Z,1,Great tutorial and very good explanation! Highly recommend to anyone who is trying to understand Decision Tree Algorithm. Helped me a lot! Thank you very much Krish!,True

@MrSurya-hn7pu,2024-02-01T10:15:40Z,6,"1:14:47, Krish u r right, Gini can't be greater than 0.5 but that is in case of binary classification only. Over here we can clearly see in that node, there are 3 output classes with each having frequency 50, so if we calculate Gini index we'll get 1 - (1/9+1/9+1/9) that is clearly 0.667. So its right over there. So basically the generalized formula of maximum gini impurity value of a classification problem is 1/n, where n is the number of classes in the output feature. Hope this helps",True

@AlphaMainly,2023-07-17T12:36:01Z,0,"1:15:20  , reason for gini  greater than 0. 5  : here we have more than two classes to predict , its a multiclass classification , so gini impurity  formula would be 1 - p1^2 - p2^2  - p3^2 - p4^2  , so its possible to have a gini value greater then 0.5",True
