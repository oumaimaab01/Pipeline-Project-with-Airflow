@rashmibadadale3352,2021-04-04T22:39:47Z,0,"Excellent video! Thank you for all you doing. Just had a query, what is the significance of Epsilon here in the equation? Any small positive integer added to a bigger number would hardly make any difference. Is there any edge case that we are trying to handle here? Like when alpha would be zero or something? But since we are squaring it in every iteration [with weights not being zero], it should be increasing always, so not sure.",True
