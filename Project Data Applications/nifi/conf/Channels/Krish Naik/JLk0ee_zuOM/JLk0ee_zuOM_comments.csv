@shefaligoyal3907,2022-08-27T11:20:32Z,0,at global minima if the deriavtive of the loss function wrt w becomes 0 then wold=wnew and lead to no change in value then how the loss  function value be reduced?,True
@munjirunjuguna5701,2022-05-29T17:55:25Z,2,"Hello Krish, Thanks for the amazing work you are doing.  Quick one: you have talked about the derivative being zero when updating the weights...so how do you tell it's a global minima and not the vanishing GD problem?",True
@rafibasha1840,2022-01-31T05:27:23Z,0,"Hi Krish,when the slope is zero at local maxima why don’t we consider local/global maxima instead of minima",True
@virkutisss3563,2021-12-12T21:03:25Z,0,"Why do we need to minimize cost function in machine learning, what's the purpose of this? Yeah, I understand that there will be less erorrs etc., but I need to understand it from fundamental perspective. Why don't we use global maximum for example?",True

@CoolSwag351,2021-05-14T06:59:04Z,8,"Hi Krish. Thanks a lot for your videos. You make me fell love with DL❤️ I took many introductory courses in coursera and udemy from which I couldn't understand all the concepts. You're videos are just amazing. One request, could you please make some practical implementations of the concepts so that it would be easy for us to understand in practical problems.",True

@saravanakumarm5647,2020-10-02T14:27:27Z,8,Am self studying machine learning. Really your videos are amazing to get the full overview quickly and even a layman can understand.,True
@anindyabanerjee743,2020-09-29T19:02:55Z,2,"If at global minima w'new is equal to w'old ,what is point of reaching there ?? am I missing something?? @krish naik",True
@vishaldas6346,2020-09-24T11:37:46Z,0,I don't think if the derivative of loss function for calculating new weights should be used as when equal to zero it makes the weights for the neural networks to W(new) = W(old). It would be related to vanishing gradient problem. Isn't it like the derivative of loss function for the output of neural network used where the y actual and y hat becomes approximately equal and the weights are optimised iteratively.  Please make me correct if I'm wrong.,True
@jaggu6409,2020-09-09T19:17:05Z,0,krish bro when the w new and w old are equal then that will be forming the vanishing gradient decent right??,True

@ibrahimShehzadGul,2020-04-26T21:45:25Z,0,"I think,  at local minima the ""∂L/∂w""  is not = 0, bcz the ANN output is not equal to the required output. if I am wrong please correct me",True
@sandipansarkar9211,2020-04-17T19:06:20Z,7,"Hi Krish, .That was also a great video in terms of understandingPlease make a playlist of practical implementation of these theoretical concepts.Then please download the ipynb notebook just below so that we can practice it in jupyter notbook",True
