@vedanti2358,2020-12-16T17:36:52Z,1,Confused about core points. COre point is that point when  we have a cluster arounf it with core point being centre.But If there are no min points we cant callit as a clustenr and we cannot call the point around which the eps is used as core then how can we say while calculating border points that when atleast one core points is present Is that core point fo a different cluster present in another clustertoo? is overlapping possible?,True
@yohoshivabasaraboyina8840,2020-12-10T10:25:42Z,3,"when the silhouette score is near 1 the clustering algorithm works well but in this, we have a negative value it means the algorithm was not working well",True
