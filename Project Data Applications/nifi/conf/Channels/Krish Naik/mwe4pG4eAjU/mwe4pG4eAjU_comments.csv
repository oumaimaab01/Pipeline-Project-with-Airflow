@BiancaAguglia,2019-10-10T11:08:43Z,80,"I only took one of Andrew Ng's courses and, although I did like the material, I was a little disappointed by how many times Andrew mentioned that we didn't have to worry if we didn't understand the math behind the models and that many ML engineers didn't understand the math. In my opinion, a good teacher can tell his students not to worry about their ignorance but (and this is super important), he also encourages them to do their best and learn as much as possible. That's the only way to be truly confident in your skills. That's another reason I like your channel and your teaching: you encourage true understanding, not just superficial learning. üôÇ",True

Also, would you recommend pytorch over tensorflow for beginners? Such that once one has learned DL, maybe they can switch over to tensorflow later when bugger projects come into picture.
