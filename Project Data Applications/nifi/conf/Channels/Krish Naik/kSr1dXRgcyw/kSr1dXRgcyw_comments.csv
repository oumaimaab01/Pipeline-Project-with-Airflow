@kenanmorani9204,2023-07-11T18:06:49Z,0,So what happened to using simpler models from scratch?! I don't think you can just replace all manual research of model building from scratch with pretrained models from hugging face or API. This approach is fast but will miss on adding novelty and in-depth analysis of appropriate approaches for the given dataset. Thank for your video still. You sure to keep us up-to-date!,True
