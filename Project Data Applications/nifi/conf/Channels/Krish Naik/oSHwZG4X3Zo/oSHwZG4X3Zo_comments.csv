@ajinkyapahinkar6463,2020-07-20T10:23:17Z,5,Would just like to to point out about loss.item() - After the loss is calculated it is stored as a single value inside a 1-D tensor. Loss.item() converts this single value in a 1-D tensor to a float value so that when you print it it doesn‚Äôt show as a tensor but a float value. Also appending loss as a tensor to the final_losses list would make it unable to plot via matplotlib hence there also we use loss.item before appending it to the list,True
