@learn_techie,2023-07-12T15:42:21Z,0,"Why image classification problem? I want to use LSTM models for prediction -transforming incoming data into pipelines and doing training and then deploying the models for decision making? Why deep learning is majority of image related stuff? I want to learn using CNN use case in diagnostic , prescriptive , decision making but I fail to uderstand why are these model only targeting computer vision rather than the diverse problem?   If you can answer it - please share I found some videos using Pytorch but still Tensor flow has no documentation to chalk the path.Why is it so? And what can you advise me? I know machine learning using models but that don't back propagate or can do self learning there are huge limitations there.",True

@samrs007,2021-10-28T18:57:25Z,6,"Hi Krish...Had seen your You-Tube channels earlier on DL, but wasn't sure of the content.After having accessed, 2-3 videos from the given playlist, truly I must acknowledge your unique style of teaching methodology ---by balancing both the  Conceptual & Mathematical/Derivation part. The pains that you have taken to explain the concepts with sufficient examples and by repeating them with the basic Black-Board/White-Board Methodology makes it a pleasant experience listening to your videos. Must applaud you for your efforts & dedication....Cheerz!!!  Would like to insert a note also if you can incorporate the following topics on DL viz.: a) GAN b) Autoencoders c) Siamese Neural Networks  If you could incorporate such topics, it would indeed help theDL Learning Community at large. Hope this helps!!!",True
