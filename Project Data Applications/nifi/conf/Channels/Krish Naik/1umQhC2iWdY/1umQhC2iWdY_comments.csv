@virajjp,2022-07-04T12:50:55Z,0,"Ok for the people who are still getting application error :-   First of all go to the logs and check what is the issue.   If you have nltk.txt not found error go to step 2  1)Instead of downloading krishs requirements.txt  run this command in your terminal :- pip freeze> requirements1.txt  This will create a new text file for you and will show you which libraries and what version you are using.   Only keep the libraries we are using in this project. Rename the file to ""requirements.txt""  2) now we have nltk in our requirements.txt file but we haven't used this library in our model. You can just simply remove nltk from requirements.txt   If in another project you do use nltk then you want those ntlk libs so   Create nltk.txt file and add all the list of corpora in that file.   This should solve.   Also as a side note make sure your procfile is just that and not procfile.txt",True

@yashkhorania3726,2021-04-02T12:38:34Z,1,"For anyone who is facing Application error after viewing the deployed app, you can follow these steps: 1. Open Anaconda command prompt 2. Make your project directory the command directory 3. Give this command -: pip freeze > requirements.txt , this will create a requirements.txt file in your current directory 4. Now in this 'requirements.txt' file keep only those libraries which are also present in the Krish's requirements.txt  file( open both and compare and modify accordingly) 5. Try and run the whole process again . It worked for me and I hope it works for you too.",True
