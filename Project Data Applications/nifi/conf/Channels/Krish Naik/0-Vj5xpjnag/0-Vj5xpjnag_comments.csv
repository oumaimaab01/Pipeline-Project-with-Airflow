@mehulgoyal5-yeariddcivilen832,2023-06-18T08:34:56Z,0,No of hidden layer and no of neuron in the particular layer is an hyperparameter so we use hyperparameter tuning by taking a list of different number of layers and neurons and do grid search cv or random search cv on our model and will calculate the accuracy of our model using cross validation technique.the most optimal hidden layers and neurons will be given the best accuracy among all the sets and we will use that particular set in our model building.,True

@anuragdhadse1426,2021-04-24T03:00:44Z,0,"For many problems tou can begin with a single layer and get reasonable performance. But for complex problems deep networks i.e. with more layers have much higher parameter efficiency. So nore layers will be able to formulate compex functions. For neurons its common to stack them in form of pyramid.  In practice, it's often simpler and more efficient to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you actually need, then use early stopping and other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.",True

@kumbalaanil8380,2021-04-23T17:17:54Z,1,"Q1: How do you decide how many hidden layers?          Ans:   Well if the data is linearly separable then you don't need any hidden layers at all.  If data is less complex and is having fewer dimensions or features then neural networks with 1 to 2 hidden layers would work. If data is having large dimensions or features then to get an optimum solution, 3 to 5 hidden layers can be used.          Note:   It should be kept in mind that increasing hidden layers would also increase the complexity of the model and choosing hidden layers such as 8, 9, or in two digits may sometimes lead to overfitting.  Q2: how many neurons to be selected in a neural network?",True

@arunmeghani1667,2021-04-23T09:33:01Z,2,"I think there is no fixed answer for this, we have to experiment in order to find a perfect set of hyperparameters, if the number of hyperparameters is small, like in the case of an ANN we can use the grid method to find a number of layers and number of nodes in each layer. we can use kerastuner for that. but I think if we have a very huge dataset then opting for more number of layers won't be a probem",True
@mukund198526,2021-04-23T09:29:07Z,18,"Hi Below is my answer -    There is no rule of thumb to find out how many hidden layers you need. In many cases, one hidden layer works well, but in order to justify this for a specific problem, you have to apply a heuristic method such as cross-validation. Using cross-validation you divide your data into two parts namely training set and validation set (also called test set).  But still, you should start with the simplest ANN architecture, that is a 3-layer network. As for the number of hidden layer units, try to use the less possible (start with 5, for instance), and allow for more if the network is unable to learn the problem. If the problem requires very complicated nonlinear separations, it may be necessary that you introduce a 2nd hidden layer, but you need to try first with just 1 hidden layer.   Determining the Number of Hidden Layers -   0 - Only capable of representing linear separable functions or decisions.   1 - Can approximate any function that contains a continuous mapping from one finite space to another.   2 - Can represent an arbitrary decision boundary to arbitrary accuracy with rational activation functions and can approximate any smooth mapping to any accuracy.  There are many rule-of-thumb methods for determining the correct number of neurons to use in the hidden layers, such as the following:  The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer. These three rules provide a starting point for you to consider. Ultimately, the selection of an architecture for your neural network will come down to trial and error. There is a concept call ‚ÄúPruning a Neural Network‚Äù, it has explained in detail the same.",True
