@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-29T19:16:00Z,19,"Data structures are so important. I'm working on the NFL Analytics competition in Kaggle now, and one of the data sets has 76 million rows. The other day I wrote a short script to process that data and I used Python lists in it. Once I started my script and let it run for a few hours, I realized it would take it 3 months to finish. 游때游때游때So I did a little bit of research and figured out how to use numpy instead. My script was done running in three hours. 游때As you can tell, I'm still very bad at this. But I'm getting better every day, so that's something to be proud of. Videos like this one should reach more people. Coding is not only a good skill to have, it will become almost similar to knowing how to read and write, or knowing a widely used language like English. Plus, it's so much fun. Yes, it's hard in the beginning, but you can create so many interesting things once you get decent at it. 游땕",True
