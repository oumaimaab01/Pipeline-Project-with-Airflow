@princejindal3618,2022-06-28T18:00:10Z,26,"For the people who are trying to implement the train_test_split and getting error.  The reason for this is when you apply lemmatize some sentences in the corpus are turned to blanks.  Try running the below code after lemmatizer code: [[i,j,k] for i,j,k in zip(list(map(len,corpus)),corpus, messages['message']) if i<1]  You will see that around 8 sentences are turned into blanks and their length is zero. The reason they turn blank is that all the words in the sentences below are in stopwords list.  [[0, '', 'What you doing?how are you?'],  [0, '', 'Where @'],  [0, '', '645'],  [0, '', 'Can a not?'],  [0, '', ':) '],  [0, '', 'What you doing?how are you?'],  [0, '', ':( but your not here....'],  [0, '', ':-) :-)']]  Because of this reason, 'simple_preprocess' ignores these rows in the corpus and the final dimensions of X and y do not match i.e 5564(X) vs 5572(y). Therefore train_test_split also throws an error.  To fix this, recalculate y by removing the messages dataframe rows corresponding to the above blank sentences as follows:  y = messages[list(map(lambda x: len(x)>0 ,corpus))] y=pd.get_dummies(y['label']) y=y.iloc[:,1].values  y.shape",True

@venkatasubbareddykachiredd9343,2022-07-11T22:29:41Z,0,"Hey Krish, I am not sure if you have clarified this, but I have a question. When we train our own model for Word2Vec, do we have to 1) split the corpus even before lemmatizing and generating word2vec model or 2) include the entire corpus (because lemmatization requires the entire vocabulary) and then split only when training the model. If we follow the first method, will we have an out-of-vocabulary issue?",True
