@Mr.Weightlosswarrior,2024-04-15T14:38:18Z,0,AI Ethics and Governance are also important. I will not say it's easy to develop an AI solution but what is more important is what are the ethical considerations taken while implementing the solution. Many good AI solutions need to be shelved because of ethical violations. I would be happy if you will cover that in your topics. Thanks,True

@bhaskartripathi,2024-04-14T08:56:38Z,1,"@Krish : I have an entirely different take on understanding statistics and the maths about Data. If one does not understands statistical properties of data such as multi-modality, multiscale behavior, entropy, non-linearity, heteroskedasticity, endogeneity and many other such concepts then one can only build thing layered superficial solutions which may or may not be helpful to your clients and fellow researchers. These are all core concepts which one must learn. One must agree and accept that the learning curve is not short. In Data Science, we must know as much about the Data as possible in addition to the traditional software engineering. Please do not teach shortcuts. We will be producing third grade, incompetent Data Scientists and ML engineers with this approach. AI is a gimmick. Only old school ML still solves the real problems.",True

Once manufacture is done our reliability team do testing on the device and provide the client with pdf of data about the machine. It is finding difficult for them to go through the whole pdf which has more than 20 pages .
