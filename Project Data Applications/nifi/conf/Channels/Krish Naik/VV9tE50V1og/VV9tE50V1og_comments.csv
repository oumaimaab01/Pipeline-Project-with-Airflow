@UtpalBhattacharjee,2024-03-14T12:10:35Z,0,Hi sir. I have a total of 5 years 2 months of experience till now and since June 2021 I am working on a foreign MNC in DevOps engineer position. Earlier worked on AWS and on premise. But in the distant past I had 2+2= 4 years of career gap. Please say do others MNCs give too much importance to career gap? Do they reject such applications?,True
