JEE is an exam which is difficult one to clear. For this, students study very hard to clear this exam. The bottom line is, for adaptability you need to study everytime. What is learning new AI tool? Basically you are studying here.  After 1-2 years, there will be new things emerge. Then also you need to study those new things to adapt. So whole this adapting things requires a person to study.

@KararaJawaab,2023-07-17T18:18:45Z,3,"I Will Strongly Say, Please Don't Panic. It's A Beginning. Many People Will Scare You About Job And Sell Their Courses & Workshops. It Has Happened In Past, It's Happening Again.  This Decade It's AI, AGI. Next Decade, It Might Be Blockchain. Thenafter, It Might Be Quantum Computing.  So, Disruption Will Keep On Coming. New Jobs Will Come, New Market Will Open, Demand Of More Employees Will Rise. It's Not Going To Decrease.  Today, New Courses Will Come Which Will Be Costly. Soon, Free Cheap And Free Courses Will Be Available. So, Don't Waste Your Money In Panic.  Also, For Sure, All The Companies Will Also Provide Trainings To Their Existing Employees About How Increase Productivity Using AI Tools. They Are Not Going To Throw You Out And Bring Someone New Guy Who Will Take Months And Months To Understand The Domain And Business.  No Company Afford Losing Their Experienced Employee. Focus On Learning The Business Domain In Which You're Working. Domain Understanding Matters A Lot.  As Of AI Is Concerned, Only Thing We Have To Do Is - _Just Don't Be Ignorant. Stay Awake._  If AI Tools Will Make The Production Cost Is Less. The Products Will Be Cheaper And Companies Will Sell More, Hence, They Need To Produce More. They Need To Implement More. For That, They Need More Employees.  New Discoveries Will Happen. New Types Of Jobs Will Appear. Many New Start-ups Will Come In Market.  So, Conclusion Is - Number Of Jobs Are Definitely Going To Rise In Coming Years. We Just Need To Stop Ourselves From Getting Deprecated.",True
