Shifted to product based company and learned a lot.   Cons of service based company - 1. Put into any project or support role, you have to be lucky to get development role which can be rare. Otherwise no learning.  2. Salary remain same, not able to manage living expenses.  3. 8 to 10 hrs which can be hectic 4. Very less hike üôÉ 5. Sometimes dress code can bother  Benefits of product based company - 1. Opposite of above points 2. Growth is very good  Final -  Even you are placed in service based company, keep learning and try for  the later...   Hope now we have gud reason to prepare for product based company",True

@baddeliyanagedondilanga7830,2021-03-25T11:16:54Z,7,"Service Based Companies :  Pros: Easy to join, More experience, keep in touch with latest technologies, Fast growth,  Opportunity to learn about many domains (hotel management systems, e commerce systems, airline systems etc.. ). If you plan to build your own business one day, being in a service based company tremendously helps. You can get in touch with clients from different domains, which can be helpful too for networking. Good quality network means you can easily find a high paying job in next time.  Cons: Work life balance is bad, you have to work until late night to meet deadlines, basic salary is low, but high bonuses depending on the client, High stress as you are forced to stay in touch with multiple tech stacks, and latest technologies.   Product Based Companies: Pros: High basic salaries, virtually no stress, work life balance is really good, Job security is high, company is stable if it's a medium to big company, if it's bigger means more stable. You can easily master the company tech stack in a few years and keep on doing it, meaning more freedom. You don't have to spend hours for learning new things when you are at home.  Cons: Less experience, hard to switch to a different company as when you leave the company you are not very experienced with different technologies, lack of bonuses, Unable to stay in touch with latest technologies, can be very boring, and monotonous. no real challenge at all if you are a problem solving type.   In a nutshell, if you had mastered programming, and want to settle down like having a family, move to management, then a product based company is best. They are basically for older people like above 30+. Service based companies,  It's better for learning, and growing in the career, like for those who had just finished their degree, or between 20 to 30, plan to move to architect position, or start their own business after 30+. Service based companies are for younger people like below 30, who have energy to spend hours in the workplace, and adventurous. Best thing is start from a service based company, and then move to a product based company if you have no programming skills like just got out of university. Working in a service based company after 30+ is very stressful, especially when having a family, and children.",True

@PradeepPol,2020-04-28T03:09:33Z,2,"I prefer Product Based company..  STABILITY I think our position is more stable in Product Based company specially if you are into R&D, Designg or Development Role as you have good product knowledge..  In Service Based Company They hire people as per the Project requirements and sometimes if marker scenerio is not good then they fire people.  WORK-LIFE BALANCE Work-life balance is more into Product Based Company.. its enough if you work sincerely for 8 hours of your working time. In Service Based I have seen many people who had to seat till late night and there is pressure from top management.  SALARY HIKES In case of salary hike, you get min 8 to 10% and max is depends on your role, your work and your product knowledge.   Some Plus point about Service Based companies, If market is in good condition then you will grow very fast in your career and also you will get good salary hikes. You get to work with different clients that helps you to improve in terms diverified knowledge and how to talk and handle the clients. If you are lucky then you can go onsite and earn in dollars and enjoy foreign place.",True
