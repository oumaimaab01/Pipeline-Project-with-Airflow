@ashwanibhardwaj4930,2023-01-29T04:46:19Z,0,"One point : When you said that due to low exponential growth which was seen in pandemic, they already knew about this. All these are intentional, you didn't mention one thing about Google. They have marked lot of profit around in 1.7 billion dollars, but still layed off people. You should mention companies don't care about layoffs they know when time will come they will layoff, fire but stupid employee thinks they owns the company environment, they are amazonians,googlers blah blah, but they are just puppets working in an insecure environment. All these companies values is just shit. Noone cares about that employee getting layoff.",True

@anna-archieve,2023-01-27T08:45:56Z,0,"haha, so when demand spikes during pandamic , then auto scaling feature of cloud was not working???  ..real reason is that, all companies or most of them came on cloud,migrated to cloud, so when everything is on cloud, why you need employees ? even in data engineering, if you make the pipeline, and it's working then you are done, you are not needed, by the way, cloud cost if almost 50% of total revenue. so they fired , and 80% of IT guys are not needed, they will be fired, then because of high cost of cloud, companies will start shutting down..and we have zero resource who can do these things at scale on-premises, looks like no ones now a days know IT in IT companies, even a 10 years old kid can learn data engineering on cloud(it's easy then Instagram),and can replace 99% of so called data engineers..",True
