@BecomingSuyogya,2020-04-13T11:16:07Z,1,"@Krish Naik : Hi Krish, first of all I am big fan of your teaching. As you said you are bridge between phd holder and junior data enthusiast.  Go to 2.30 timing , you said we have to do it feature selection for TEST data as well. But I have a problem here. Please help.   I have completed everything till here.  [ Note : In test data feature engineering, I used LabelEncoder from sklearn as TEST data does not have SalesPrice. ]   But I am struck in feature selection as my train data is already with 21 features. But my test data has 82 features which we are trying to reduce to 21 as shown in this video's tutorial.  Problem :  Since we do not have SalePrice column in TEST data, how do you perform fit for SelectFromModel.  Example : In train data : feature_sel_model = SelectFromModel(Lasso(alpha=0.005,random_state=0)) feature_sel_model.fit(X_train,y_train)  But what about test data : feature_sel_model = SelectFromModel(Lasso(alpha=0.005,random_state=0)) feature_sel_model.fit(X_test,??) -> cuz y_train was ""SalesPrice"" in train data.  Kindly guide me the way as I am almost there. Thank you so much for teaching brilliantly. Cheers !!!",True
