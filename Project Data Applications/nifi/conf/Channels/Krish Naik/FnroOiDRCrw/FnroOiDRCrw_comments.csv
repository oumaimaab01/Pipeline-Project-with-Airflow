@parthiban9312,2019-12-22T17:08:02Z,2,Hi Krish I have a lot in general questions in random(couldn't bring them under any category) 1)As a new DS practioner can we learn DL directly without learning ML ?(As I started with kaggle DL course much interested over DL ) What would you suggest? 2)How to learn any library(Sci-kit for example) and its offerings in detail? (Because whenever I go through any code online I see something new from any library so how to learn them completely) 3)In this video you have mentioned that GPU's and Linux systems are being mostly used in DL work space so where can we learn about installation of GPU's in case this might also be a plus as a skill ? (I have a basic knowledge on Linux operating systems ) 4) For a beginner in DS with DL specialization with NLP and Computer vision use cases experience how good is his possibility in finding his first project in DS ? (Already in IT with 2 years experience now self learning into DS transition),True
@viralthegenius,2019-12-22T07:16:03Z,1,Krish bhai which one to choose between nlp and dl?,True
@UnfoldDataScience,2019-12-22T07:14:22Z,1,Good Info Krish.,True
@ganeshrao405,2019-12-22T05:45:35Z,1,"Good the difference and yes it would be better understanding comes by practice. One request krish -  classify the normal salary range of different employees based on information provided by different features in the dataset. The Class variable provides the range of salary into 3 categories that are low, mid and high range. Can you give examples related to this ? i mean any used dataset similar problem statement solution.",True

@Agrover112,2019-12-21T18:55:49Z,5,Gonna tell my kids this is Structuring Machine Learning Projects course by Andrew Ng üòÅüòç,True
@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-21T18:43:50Z,12,"I think the difference between ML and DL is confusing and, if we truly want to clear it up, what helps a lot is working on few projects, trying to solve them using both approaches, and see the which approach worked better. üòä   One example that helped me when I first learned about ML and DL, was the problem of classifying a dog.    1. With ML, you have to describe the dog features (for example, has fur, has tail, barks, etc), assign a value to each of those features, and label each instance as being a dog or not.    2. With DL, you just have to give the dog picture and the label ""dog"". The DL network has many layers, and those layers try to extract the features which make a dog a dog. üòä   So, once your model is done:    1. With ML, you can't give it a dog picture and expect it to predict what's in the picture. You have to give it another vector of values for the features (for example, fur = 1, tail = 1, barks = 0, etc) and let the model predict based on those features.    2. With DL, you can just give it a dog picture and it should be able to classify it as a dog.    With DL, you need way more data than you do with ML, but DL models work better for those kind of tasks if they are trained on the right kind of data. üòä",True

@PawanKumar-ie9gq,2019-12-21T17:22:11Z,3,I'm really inspired by your work...thanks alot for your efforts,True
@CareerTalk,2019-12-21T17:21:55Z,4,"Very well explained Krish Sir,  I work with a lot of business/ data analysts, this information will definitely help them understand how to proceed with machine or deep learning on the ground. I will definitely love to include a reference of this informative video in mychannel(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQbUlYFhjEkt8CnbwDhpcow) focused on career planning.  I completely agree that the junior folks need to understand labeling and other concepts very well. Thanks for sharing the details.",True
