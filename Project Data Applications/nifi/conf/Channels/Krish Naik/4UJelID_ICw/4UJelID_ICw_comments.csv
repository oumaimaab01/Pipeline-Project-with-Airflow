@sunset2193,2023-11-08T08:04:02Z,0,Why 1/2m means dy/dx  which means the small changes in j(theta1)/theta1 with respect to theta 1 so that's why 1/2m to reduce to minimum distance between actual minus predict if we do 1/m it will give us big difference so thats why we should not do average instead of average we multiply it with 2 to get slight minimal difference of SSE if divide it with m which means it will get avarage it will just affect the minimal error so that why to reduce the error we divide ‚ûó 2m which will give 0.0like this so all data points now closest to best fit line this is called cost function,True
