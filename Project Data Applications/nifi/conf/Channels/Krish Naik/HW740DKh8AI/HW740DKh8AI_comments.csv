@MrZola1234,2020-12-20T20:15:20Z,0,I just transitioned into a data analyst role in my company and definitely exploring data science tools and the job market in this field.  i get the impression that a lot of the data analyst role will be eliminated in the next few years by machine learning.

@khitishmohanty9470,2020-12-19T12:18:35Z,5,"I don‚Äôt think one person can be a proficient in all areas you mentioned. Data science itself is a huge domain .a day to day life of a data scientist involves going through endless amount of research papers and find a suitable algorithm for a business problem.  As part of a data science project, data scientists do data cleansing and transformation activities. But if any data scientist focus on the DevOps or any other core development activities then definitely that person has spend less time on nurturing the maths behind the data. It‚Äôs a misconception going on that study 15 algorithms and u will be a data scientist. If that‚Äôs possible then it‚Äôs as easy as studying Java and becoming a full stack developer.",True
