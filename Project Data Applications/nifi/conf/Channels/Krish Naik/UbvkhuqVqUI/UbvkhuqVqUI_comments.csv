I always thought recurrent networks could be trained without 'Y' because they can detect ""temporal patterns"" in X itself. 1) What advantage do LSTMs have over normal deep neural networks or other regression algorithms because you can fit a regression between Y and X. 2) Why is it necessary to convert into 'supervised' data (X, Y)  before training LSTM? Time series models such as ARIMA do not require converting into supervised data. They can train by 'swallowing' the whole time series. Can't LSTMs do this? 3) Any machine learning models that can predict time series like ARIMA without converting into supervised data?",True
