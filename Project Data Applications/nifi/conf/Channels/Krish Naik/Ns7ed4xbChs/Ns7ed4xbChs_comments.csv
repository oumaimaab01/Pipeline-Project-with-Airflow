@bayiletayegetu9050,2021-09-05T17:19:36Z,0,"Greetings of the Day sir, you know sir, parent has the responsibilities of for child when the child is feeling sad, hungry, thirsty, cold and wrong and they teach all the skills they have and bring the child to a good level. The teachers, are like the parent they teach all the skills they have and bring the student to a good level. There for the parents and the teachers are two sides of the same coin. The coin does not make sense if there is not one side the same thing for the student if the student loses either the parents or the teachers, the student may not reached his goal.so just as a child is happy to see his parents live a long life and do many wonderful things, so the same is to his teachers happy to see his teachers live a long life and do many wonderful things. So I wish my all respected teachers in every aspect a very happiest teacher’s day and a very long life and many wonderful works with a lots of blessings with your families and communities and as you go through each year, remember to count your blessings, not your age served as teacher. Count your amazing experiences, not your mistakes. Happy teacher’s day one’s again.",True
