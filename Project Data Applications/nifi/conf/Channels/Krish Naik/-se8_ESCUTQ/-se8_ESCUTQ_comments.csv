@dineshs1683,2024-03-30T13:13:20Z,0,"Firstly thanks for awesome explanation, I'm in progress of watching the video and trying on my own. while doing recursion method, I think there is no need of while loop and extra return statement. But we need to add one more condition if i greater then j return -1 (value not present).  here is the code i tried and it works well. Please let me know if something wrong or not a right way to do this! Thanks!  def BinarySearch(arr,i,j,x):     mid = i + (j-i) // 2     if i > j :         return -1     elif arr[mid] == x :       return mid     elif arr[mid] < x : #right side       return BinarySearch(arr, mid + 1, j , x)     else : #left side arr[mid] > x       return BinarySearch(arr, i, mid - 1, x)",True

@ai_in_the_blood,2022-09-10T10:49:08Z,0,"Binary search is faster than Ternary Search, reason being the number of comparisons in ternary search is 4 , and in binary search it is only 2.  The number of iterations in Ternary Seach is not able to compensate for the increase in number of comparisons.",True
@kondavidyasagar6115,2022-09-04T09:53:49Z,2,The way of teaching is very good. The concepets are easily understandable.,True
@satyam1543,2022-08-31T11:48:31Z,0,I think you should also discuss topics like rotated & order agnostic  binary search,True
