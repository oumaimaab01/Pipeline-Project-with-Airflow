We are doing outsourced full Fletch development/testing except marketing for the XXXXX technologies product PPPP.  I am just 6 months old here, and I haven't got satisfactory answers to my queries from my manager.  Below are my doubts: 1. Why XXXX technology gives outsourcing development to service-based YYYY.--my genetic question would be  what are the specific reasons a product-based organization outsourced their product? 2. what are the pros and cons for product-based and for service-based as well in such scenarios. 3. what are the chances that again outsourcing goes to some other service-based company - in some cases product outsourcing goes here and there?? 4. Is there a chance that XXXX technologies rethink again do the development on its own after some years 5. what about job security/Growth in such cases if a product goes here and there?? -- does it affect decrement in the salary ??  I would appreciate the answers.",True
