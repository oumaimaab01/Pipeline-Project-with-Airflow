@RamanDeep-tj1jf,2022-06-06T06:45:00Z,2,"Ds is important Reason : if u work in a product based company ..if u have a alot of users , then ds comes in picture . Ds is required to optimize time and space . Suppose if many user tried to login to ur website at same time .. Server might crash .. To solve these kind of issues we need proper optimize .. Algorithm .. Data structures different techniques helps us to solve these kind of issues . Mostly startup companies dont ask much  ds question ( less users  no much requirement of optimize algo)  middle level or big companies will  always ask you the deeply ds questions because they have many users , the want the engineers to write the optimize code which will work for all users  . 😊😊hopefully this answer will help 😊",True
