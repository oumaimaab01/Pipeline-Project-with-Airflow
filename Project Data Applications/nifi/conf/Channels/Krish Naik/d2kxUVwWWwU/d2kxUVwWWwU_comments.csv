@anand4nov,2023-10-13T11:29:00Z,42,"00:06 Day one of deep learning - covering basics and interview preparation  06:46 Chatbots, machine learning, and deep learning explained.  18:36 Importance of data and hardware advancement in deep learning  23:57 Neural network with input and output layers  33:58 Neural networks use weights and bias to determine neuron activation levels.  39:15 Forward propagation involves multiplying the inputs by weights, adding bias, and applying an activation function.  50:11 Simple linear regression and gradient descent  55:50 Today's agenda covers forward propagation, chain rule of derivatives, vanishing gradient problem, and loss functions.  1:07:01 Weight updation formula is the key to reducing loss in backward propagation.  1:12:13 Weight updation formula in gradient descent  1:22:31 Z is an activation function applied to o1 times w4 plus bias.  1:27:46 Neural network structure and weight updation formula  1:38:50 Sigmoid activation function has a derivative ranging from 0 to 0.25.  1:43:53 The first activation function discussed is sigmoid.  1:53:42 Relu activation function solves the dead neuron problem.  1:58:43 Different activation functions for different types of problems  2:09:19 Mean squared error (MSE) is a quadratic loss function used for regression tasks.  2:14:34 Mean squared error penalizes outliers, resulting in a major shift in the regression line.  2:25:48 The first step is to assign values to columns indicating good, bad, and neutral.  2:30:57 Today's session covered the topic of optimizers in deep learning  2:41:59 Using gradient descent for training deep learning models with large datasets requires extensive resources.  2:47:12 Mini batch stochastic gradient descent improves convergence and reduces resource complexity  2:58:01 Exponential weighted average is a technique to smooth data and give more importance to previous values.  3:03:19 Exponential Moving Average for Smoothing Curve in Gradient Descent  3:14:04 The value will decrease as the timestamp goes  3:19:14 Exponential weighted average helps control learning rate increase  3:30:53 Implementing artificial neural network using TensorFlow GPU and reading dataset  3:36:09 Predict whether a customer will exit a bank or not.  3:46:21 Perform train test split and feature scaling  3:51:57 Using standard scalar to transform data  4:02:26 Dropout layer is used in neural networks to reduce overfitting.  4:07:21 Neural network training process with dense layers and Adam optimizer.  4:17:25 Early stopping helps to automatically stop the training process when the monitored metric stops improving  4:22:52 You can generate a confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy for the test data.  4:33:46 We will be discussing about convolution neural network (CNN) in this session.  4:39:31 Visual cortex has multiple layers responsible for different tasks  4:49:52 Convolution operation explained  4:54:53 The calculation results in a pattern of zeros and negative numbers.  5:05:30 Padding prevents loss of information during convolution operation.  5:10:48 Padding and activation function are important in convolutional operations  5:21:46 Extract the highest numbers from each output  5:26:48 Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks  5:37:07 The model is created with a flattening layer and a fully connected neural network",True

@tusharmawa2542,2022-05-22T06:21:12Z,21,I wanna be the first one to complete this tutorial. There you go guys I am not up for 6-7 hours straight. Will make an update by 7 pm today evening on whether I completed this tutorial or not. Plus will add time stamps!!!!    LET'S GOOOOOOOO   Edit :- Just completed the course and it is 6.23 pm I made it!!! The course is pretty decent for beginners in Deep Learning. I got 75% of the course I would say because I have a background in Machine Learning. It would have been better if activation functions were explained more deeply. Rest of it was good. I would revise it again ( Not at 2x speed this time ) and will add time stamps as I am very tired nowwwwww   adios amigos. Thanks Krish <3,True
