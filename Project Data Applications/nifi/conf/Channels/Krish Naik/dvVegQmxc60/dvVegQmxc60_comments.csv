@kvsubbaiahsetty9834,2021-01-04T05:20:06Z,1,"Why I donâ€™t like C++  and  Java and eliminate them from my list,  is that they are not human  ( programmer) friendly to read and code. And as Data Scientists, we understand that many concepts of DS/ML by reading programs by experts, because many concepts are mathematically involved. Understanding these maths heavy concepts by reading programs from third parties ( experts)  written in high-level languages like python is easy compared to low-level languages like C++. Java and C++ are machine-friendly and may execute fast, but non-human friendly to read and understand)  IMHO, go for the above five. Any comments welcome.",True
