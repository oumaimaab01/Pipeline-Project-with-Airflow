Even if you get the job you will definately struggle to keep that job, again you need to learn something new and apply. There is always a risk of automating your task. In order to tackle this problem, you again upskill. Upskilling is nothing but learning new things. Again after some years you have to upskill because nowsadays industry trends are changing rapidly. Again you need to learn new things. All these learnings and applying will take a lot of time. Majority of your life will get spend on learning. And the last thing, you will not get rich by this formula. You will stay middle class or luckly upper middle class with constant struggle.",True
