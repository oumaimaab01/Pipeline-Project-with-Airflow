@vinayraghunath1992,2021-11-30T08:25:35Z,1,"One quick doubt here... Might be a dumb one... In ReLU we have f(z) = z, for z >0 and  f(z) = 0 for z<0, that has led to the 'dead neuron' problem, correct... So we picked leaky ReLU to handle this problem.... My qstn: Why cant we use some function as follows: f(z) = z for z > 0 and f(z)= -z for z <0  In such a case, for z>0 the derivative will ve +1 and for z<0, derivative will be -1.  Is there any problem with this approach?",True
@arindammukherjee391,2021-10-25T22:10:09Z,0,Amazing video..just a little change needed. Weight updation formula is wrong. It should be W new = W old - n dL/W old,True
@karthikmalasani,2021-10-16T03:23:34Z,0,"Good video overall. Just one small technical correction:  At 6:35, you said you can't find derivative of 0. That's not correct. On the left hand side of y-axis f = 0 for all values of z. And you said derivative of that region is 0. The problem with derivative of Relu(z) at z = 0 is it is discontinuous i.e. if you are at z=0 and you go towards right say to z=0.001 then f = 0.001. For z = 0.002, f = 0.002. If we compute derivative numerically, then df/dz = 1 in the right side of 0. But when z = -0.001 or z = -0.002 then f = 0. If we compute derivative numerically, then df/dz = 0 in the left side of 0. So, it's discontinuous. But discontinuity at one point is not usually a problem when dealing with continuous valued inputs as the Borel measure of that one point is 0 (using universal approximation theorem we can only approximate Borel measurable function. So using Borel measure here too to justify while discontinuity at one or even a finite number of points is not a problem).",True

@yatinarora9650,2019-10-26T20:18:36Z,0,"One doubt in relu if w_new = w_old - n dL/dw let in chain rule all derivatives are 1 and let learning rate is also 1 and let w_old was also 1 or 2    w_new = 2 - 1 * (1*1*1) w_new = 1 like that, in next 2 iterations, it'll reach zero or -ve  then it'll reduce by 1 directly which can bring w_new near to zero or -ve very fastly which can be very dangerous. but in case of sigmoid or tanh this was always less so it'll w_new will change slowly.   as all the weights while initializing will be small positive numbers, so in that case relu will make them 0 or -ve   So how relu can be good.   for -ve leaky relu is good, but first of all, it should not go to -ve very fast.
