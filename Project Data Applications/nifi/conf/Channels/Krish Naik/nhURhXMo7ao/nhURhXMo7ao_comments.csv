@shailendrarana6921,2020-09-06T12:14:32Z,0,"Hi Krish, PLEASE BE KIND ENOUGH TO REPLY THIS, I am a subscriber of your channel, currently a teacher, having a major in social sciences(Public administration). I am pursuing a diploma in Data science(Upgrad) because i read that background does't matter for this particular domain. I enjoy playing with data, and also had started developing a liking for coding but find most vacancies online with a requirement of computer science degree. I actually wanted to get out of the monotony of the teaching job but now i sometimes doubt my decision, will i able to get a good paying job as is promised by the data science field??And in context of my past what specialization would you suggest for me among the roles of data analyst, business analyst, data engineering, deep learning or nlp?",True
