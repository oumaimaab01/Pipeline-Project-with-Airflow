@tanzeelahmed2055,2020-04-07T07:08:09Z,0,"Hi I am now studying in metric. I have learned python, libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. I have also learned linear regression by using sklearn, but it is very difficult for me to understand the mathematics behind machine learning. i could not understand the mathematics. Should I leave the rest of machine learning for sometime and come back later or I should go ahead and learn sklearn, but do not understand mathematics.....",True

@BiancaAguglia,2020-04-04T20:05:51Z,7,"A few days ago I came across a blog called Less Wrong, and your video made me think of one of the posts I read there. The post started like this: ""For years, my self-education was foolish and wasteful. I learned by consuming blog posts, Wikipedia articles, classic texts, podcast episodes, popular books, video lectures, peer-reviewed papers, Teaching Company courses, and Cliff's Notes. How inefficient!   I've since discovered that textbooks are usually the quickest and best way to learn new material. That's what they are designed to be, after all. Less Wrong has often recommended the ""read textbooks!"" method. Make progress by accumulation, not random walks.""   The whole post is interesting and useful. It recommends great textbooks in a variety of fields. Unfortunately, the list is short and doesn't have ML textbooks. üôÉSo, in ML and DL we have to be even more resourceful. Like someone else said, we need textbooks that haven't even been written yet.    I like your approach the most when it comes to learning (probably because it fits my learning style):    1. make sure you learn the fundamentals (that's where good textbooks in Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Calculus can help a lot)    2. read the papers that explain a certain model or technique you're interested in, and follow that up with blog posts, YouTube videos, junior colleagues with a PhD üòÅto make sure you truly understand what you are learning.   3. practice, practice, practice. Implement what you've learned.",True
