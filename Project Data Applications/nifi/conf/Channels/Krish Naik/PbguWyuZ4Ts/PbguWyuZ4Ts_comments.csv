@devilgod2980,2024-05-09T10:25:35Z,0,"06:34 📊 Type 1 error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true, leading to a false positive conclusion. 14:28 📉 Type 2 error happens when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false, resulting in a false negative conclusion. 19:04 📝 In a hypothesis test, a one-tailed test focuses on one direction (e.g., greater than or less than), while a two-tailed test examines both directions. 26:15 🧠 Understanding the context of a question is crucial to determine whether a hypothesis test is one-tailed or two-tailed. 32:41 📏 Point estimate in inferential statistics involves using sample data to estimate population parameters, recognizing that the estimate may not be exact but approximate. 33:01 📊 Point estimates in statistics provide values that estimate parameters, such as the mean, from a sample. 33:30 🛠 Confidence intervals are used to estimate the population mean, typically calculated as point estimate plus or minus the margin of error. 35:56 📈 When given the population standard deviation, the z-test formula is applied to calculate the confidence interval. 37:01 🧮 Given population standard deviation, sample size, and confidence level, constructing a confidence interval involves calculating the margin of error using the z-test. 51:23 🧪 When population standard deviation is unknown, the t-test is used to calculate confidence intervals, with the sample standard deviation and sample size. 01:09:26 📊 Z-test helps determine if a value falls within a specific range by comparing it with critical values like 1.96 for 95% confidence. 01:11:05 📈 Z-test formula: (x - μ) / (σ / √n). Standard error (σ / √n) becomes relevant for larger sample sizes to match population means. 01:15:06 🧮 Test statistic computation for Z-test: x̄ - μ / (σ / √n), considering sample mean, population mean, and sample size. 01:16:53 🧠 Rejecting the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing suggests an effect, like increased intelligence due to medication. 01:26:41 📉 T-test formula for test statistic: (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n), with x̄ as sample mean, μ as population mean, s as sample standard deviation, and n as sample size. 01:28:29 🎓 Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates an increase in intelligence, highlighting the importance of hypothesis testing in real-world scenarios.",True

Margin of error accounts for uncertainty in estimating the population mean.* 35:13 📈 *Example problem: Given population standard deviation, sample size, and mean, construct a 95% confidence interval using the z-test formula.* 36:33 📉 *When population standard deviation is known, and sample size is greater than or equal to 30, use the z-test formula for confidence intervals.* 49:48 🧮 *When population standard deviation is not given, and sample size is less than 30, use the t-test formula for confidence intervals.* 51:05 📚 *Example problem: Given sample standard deviation, sample size, and mean, construct a 95% confidence interval using the t-test formula.* 59:11 🎉 *Completion of confidence interval explanation and problem-solving using z-test and t-test.* [01:07:58 URL](https://youtu.be/PbguWyuZ4Ts?t=4078s) *📊 When conducting hypothesis testing, the third step involves stating the alpha value, often set at 0.05.* [01:08:28 URL](https://youtu.be/PbguWyuZ4Ts?t=4108s) *🤔 In the fourth step, defining the decision rule is crucial.

Then why do we need T-test μ = 520  1σ = μ + std = 520+80 = 600 2σ = 1σ + std  = 600+80 = 680 same has  -1σ = μ - std   = 520-80 = 440 -2σ = (-1σ) - std   =  440-80 = 360 So the Population mean lie BTW (360 - 680)  This could be the right way??,True
