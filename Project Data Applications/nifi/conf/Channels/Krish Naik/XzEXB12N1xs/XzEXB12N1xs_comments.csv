@akshatabm4491,2023-10-21T06:50:39Z,0,Is the detect_outlier using z score program working fine for everyone?? It is not returning correct output for a diff dataset used.,True
@sheelstera,2022-11-19T13:08:36Z,0,Standard Normal distribution can be applied only to a normally distributed column...SND applied to a non-normally distributed column may give you a mean of 0 and and SD = 1 but the nature of distribution is still non-normal. Z score cannot be directly tied to the 99.7% of ND in such a case. The interpretation of Z score is therefore subject to the kind of the distribution structure of the column which remains unaltered before and after the Standardization process.,True

@cvb6931,2021-05-08T18:30:45Z,0,I have few doubts...  why threshold value is considered as 3 I have seen other examples they also considering as 3 only ? is it always 3 ? why to only multiply with 1.5 for lower and upper bound values ... any specific reason? Does  iQR works on categorical columns also ... I know that zscore doesn't work for categorical values?,True

@sudiptachakraborty745,2020-06-23T17:42:03Z,6,"Sir - I appreciate your effort of making all these beautiful videos. It makes life easy for all of us. But I need to make one comment on this video, at the beginning you said when the weight(x) is increasing height(y) is also increasing but in real world if you think it's not possible right ?   As per my thought process may be you wanted to say when the height(x) is increasing weight(y) is also in a increasing trend.  In most of the cases, when a person's height increases automatically weight also get increased but it's not the reverse.  I hope i am making sense here.   Thank you once again :)",True

You are saying anything beyond 1.5iqr will be outlier, then why we are doing low= q1-1.5iqr and high=q3+1.5iqr. cant we straight away get outliers by comapring if number is less than or greater than 1.5iqr.
