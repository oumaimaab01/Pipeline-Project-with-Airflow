@KokkeOP,2023-07-20T00:08:01Z,3,"To anyone who reached this point READ THIS FRIENDLY REMINDER, Go and make sure you stop your notebook. Everytime ru ""shift+Enter"" ANY CODE that will run a model or algorithm, AWS WIL CHARGE YOU. Being a free tier or not. leaving a notebook runing on idle is charged by the hour just for being ""inService"". This was not clearly advised in the begining (showing exactly where to stop and what exactly was going to charge) and for this reason some might be charged at this point. Next time, if going to suggest others to add a credit card and learn how to use a tool that will charge you, i highly suggest to advice ALWAYS to close and stop all process before and after each video. In my case, I returned to this part 6 after a fewe days and the monthly charging was over the ideal. Nothing terrible (1.44USD) but not in the budget for a simple runing model like this one. SO, ONLY RUN a block of code once and only if you have already doublechecked its goign to be necessary. This is a missconception that happens due to the fact we are very acostumed to run over and over our own local instances  using Condas or other local IDEs like a simple Jupyter. but this is not how it works in AWS SageMaker. as always, great tutorial KrishNaik Sir.",True

@factstore27,2022-06-25T06:53:31Z,0,"hi sir, actually i want to ask that if we are using amazon sagemaker autopilot then the process is automated, so here for training and batch transform it chooses instance automatically which costs a lot. Can you help me to reduce it.",True

@mayanktripathi4u,2020-10-19T22:12:54Z,0,"Hi Krish Sir, The output model getting save for each run... Is there a way we could avoid it.. and save only the model which we want.. similar to what we do using joblib or so. Just a though, as keep on increasing the output files will exhaust the S3 limit.",True
@harshithkumarpedarla6233,2020-08-31T10:32:18Z,0,is there any prerequisite for learning sagemaker ??,True
@harshithkumarpedarla6233,2020-08-31T10:31:43Z,1,being a newbie to sagemaker i could not able to understand the  coding part you are working on. if possible please explain a bit slow  and take more sessions about this sagemaker  especially for beginners of sagemaker,True
