I'm glad to see so many people working on making them better and on implementing them. Personally, I'm more fascinated by how we can use AI to get insights into what causes disease and how we can prevent it. There's so much to discover. We've barely scratched the surface. ðŸ˜Š",True

@KenJee_ds,2020-01-28T18:29:37Z,3,"Great video! As a data scientist myself, I hope that medical professionals are open minded enough to adopt these technologies. Unfortunately, I have experienced multiple closed minded medical professionals that are intimidated by new technology and are afraid that ML will replace the need for them. Hopefully the few people like this will begin to change their minds leading to countless more saved lives. I also have a few videos on my channel that talk about the implications of data science across various industries, hopefully they complement this one nicely!",True
