@VisualCraftHub,2022-10-24T13:33:13Z,1,how to attach this model with a user interface,True
@taeefnajib,2022-04-30T13:49:55Z,0,"Is such a high loss value normal for Linear Regression? Can Krish sir, or anyone else confirm?",True
@TheSougata1,2022-02-24T07:06:46Z,0,"Sir, Please upload CNN videos using PyTorch.",True
@Nil_money,2022-01-21T07:21:13Z,0,I am really thankful to you for all of your efforts in sharing your knowledge and experiences. May god bless you.,True

@aryanabhi7466,2021-05-16T20:33:42Z,1,"plt.plot(range(epochs), final_losses) plt.ylabel('RMSE Loss') plt.xlabel(""Epochs"")  RuntimeError: Can't call numpy() on Tensor that requires grad. Use tensor.detach().numpy() instead.",True
@vibhoragarwal2935,2021-04-23T11:19:52Z,1,"Huge mistake 1:14:29 Normalization should be done before activation, otherwise the gradients will behave absurdly.",True
@lakeguy65616,2021-02-05T18:09:57Z,1,"I have a question.  Isn't dropout redundant with RELU?  I mean, Relu ""drops out"" all values less an Zero. When you compound Relu with a dropout value of .4, your effective dropout is much much higher.  Am I missing something?",True
