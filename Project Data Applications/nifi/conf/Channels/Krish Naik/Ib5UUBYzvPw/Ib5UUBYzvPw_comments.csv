@pdpbasak,2021-08-31T06:23:54Z,8,"Hi Krish, just a little correction, in this video and even in your previous video you said that p-value and the significance value are the same and are denoted by alpha. Actually they are not the same. Significance value/level (alpha) is defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true. Also known as the false positive (FP) rate. In contrast, p-value is defined as ""the smallest"" level of significance at which we can ""still"" reject the null hypothesis. For a particular test with a particular level of significance (alpha), p-value obtained can be greater, lesser or even equal to the alpha. The decision rule is to ""reject"" the null hypothesis if p-value < alpha.",True
