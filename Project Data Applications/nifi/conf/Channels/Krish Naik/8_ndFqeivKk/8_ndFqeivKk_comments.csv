@byoutekinaeiyuu,2020-10-10T23:37:18Z,20,"I am surprised that Mechanical and Civil Engineering is non technical.   Mechanical Engineers can become Data Scientists without bigger difficulties (in my opinion) as the major includes a lot - if not all - of the math skills required for data science job. There is a lot of data science in Lean and Six Sigma. The largest issue is coding. HOWEVER from what I have seen the coding in data science is not that crazy hard. If you can do fluid mechanics, you should be able to master python good enough. I know many successful transfers from Mechanical Engineering to Data Science (hopefully one day I will join). Mechanical Engineering is also a bit of a broad term (but which field of engineering isn't...), and there is need for FEM, Monte Carlo in ME... one of my ME Professors was working on Neural Networks.   I'd argue that some Chemists and Material Scientists can also transfer to Data Science relatively easily.   I don't know how well an average statistician can code... The mathematicians I have worked with couldn't code at all, which was a huge surprise for me. The IT Engineers can have some issues working with ""real world"" dirty data or problems. I think it is because of the lack of physics  in the IT studies syllabus (physics or anything measurement related, experimental etc...)

@nasrullahturke4480,2019-11-27T19:00:11Z,72,"I got interested in data science last December 2018. I took a class for this paying 14000 and everything was above head for me.   I did realised then I have a long journey to make. From commerce background math statistics programming language was nowhere near my eyesight. I decided to learn math statistics Probablity and linear algebra at the same time started python language. I got all the math books from standard 1stt till 12th. In this one year I have managed to reach till 10th standard but concentrating on basic. I know python basics int str list tuple dict and imp data science tools like pandas series and dataframe numpy n dimensional data array statistics like measure of central tendency, measures of spread, measure of position, different distribution Scikit Learn Matplotlib n studying machine learning supervised and unsupervised checking so many different youtube channel what is Knn logostic regression cross validation k fold cross validation so many thngs to cover yet. It's a long journey for people from commerce background. Friends don't fool yourself if you'll are not interested in maths and statistics. I have ended up making so many notes in bits and pieces and after one year I have decided to take few certification course from coursera. It will take time and hard work. It's my personal experience that I have shared. I knew I would take 2 years atleast to be in comfort zone before really diving deep. Plan your study wisely.",True
