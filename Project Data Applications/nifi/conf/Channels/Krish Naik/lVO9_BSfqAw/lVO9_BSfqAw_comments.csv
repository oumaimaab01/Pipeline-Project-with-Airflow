@nithishraghav1204,2021-08-17T16:27:19Z,53,In 2018 I failed 14 times before getting into the data science domain. In each interview helped me to understand what the industry is looking from the data scientist and I prepared based on that which helped me to land the job in the 15th interview.  I made the successful transition from the non-it domain to the data science domain.,True
