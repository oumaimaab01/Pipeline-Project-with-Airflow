@prashantlalwani527,2022-06-08T15:31:39Z,1,sir can you please make a tracker sheet for data science as you did earlier because after that video you made alot of awesome content which if included in tracker sheet would be very helpful. if making tracker sheet is not possible than please make a short video or community post which tells us which playlist to follow for corresponding topic especially data analysis . I saw your data science roadmap video after that i was searching content on your youtube channel. i nearly got all the topics but everything was scattered also there were multiple videos on same topic (for example statistics' topics). so please guide us regarding this. Thanks  alot for these awesome contents.,True
