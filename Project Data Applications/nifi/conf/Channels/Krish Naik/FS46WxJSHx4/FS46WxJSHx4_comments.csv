@fet1612,2019-11-09T07:45:50Z,2,"4:55 seaborn Run these 4 lines of code: (1) the first line is for (a) importng seaborn as sns and (b) setting style and color with the sns.style() methods. We have 2 parameters passed into the sns.style() method, style=""ticks"" and color_codes=True. (2) the second line instantiates the < iris > object with the load_dataset() method of sns with the snippet, < iris = sns.load_dataset(""iris"") (3) the third line collects the seaborn's pairplot() method and stores it in the variable instantiated as < g > the variable name (4) the variable < g > is invoked which plots all the visual display systems. try it on Jupiter notebook. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<  Say how you like it !! Compare the following sequence of code snippets without the use of variable call < g > See how nicely seaborn has made our life easier for ** data visualization**.

@fet1612,2019-11-09T07:19:46Z,5,"4:40 Good job, Krish Naik. Here are some of the regressors we'll often be met with, in course of time. At the bottom of the list, we have a link to scikit-learn.org to get our novice viewers to have a better perception of what Regressors and Classifiers are all about and how they perform. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<< Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   i) Decision Tree regression, ii) Random Forest regression, iii) XGBoost regression, iv) KNN regression, etc. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>> 1) Linear regression 2) Logistic regression 3) Polynomial regression 4) Stepwise regression 5) Ridge regression 6) Lasso regression 7) ElasticNet regression 8) Decision Tree regression 9) Random Forest regression 10) KNN regression,  and there is plenty more ... You can go to this site to get an overview. You must already be familiar with scikit-learn.org if you are working with machine learning. But if you are a novice, a newbie, it's good to know what is available where.  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning",True
