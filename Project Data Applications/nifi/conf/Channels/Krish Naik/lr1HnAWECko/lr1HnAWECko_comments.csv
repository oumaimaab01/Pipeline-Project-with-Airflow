@pkzz2310,2022-06-16T17:00:20Z,0,"I have a contrary view auto ml surely will replace most the data scientist in the market as even an accurate of 84% is good estimate to make any good decision , even if a data scientist increases the accuracy by 4-6 % it does not a significant impact. After all every AutoML algorithm is created by years of research by certain experienced data scientist. Rather data scientist can play a significant role in filling the missing link in the pipeline or debug any ml pipeline just Data Analyst stuff.",True
@rayyanamir8560,2022-03-12T19:17:34Z,0,"If job of a data scientist is gonna get automated and easier, it simply means that the job of data scientist would be handed over to software engineers (ML engineers or AI engineers) so that companies don't have to pay separately by hiring a data scientist. Also over time, I think auto ml accuracy would increase. In the end I'm not saying that auto ml will replace data scientists, but I think that the number of data scientists  would drastically reduce over time as ml engineers would take up this job.  This is my opinion.",True
@rahulbatish8704,2022-01-01T14:08:22Z,0,initially people used various algos in CV now we have YOLO which has brought object detection to merely copying files to folder and tagging pics that's it same will happen in DL when computers get powerful,True
@rahulbatish8704,2022-01-01T14:05:51Z,0,if you have a really good pc with great GPU ram and this automl gets completely automated this will 101% decrease ML jobs,True
@siddheshmhatre6921,2021-12-30T08:13:06Z,0,"Well said Sir, a person in Data Science field can only conclude about auto ML replacing humans.",True

@amitg2k,2019-10-25T19:22:46Z,7,"Very well placed. AutoML will Infact make job of data scientist easy. Data scientist can now focus more on business problems first while using AutoML getting an early access to confidence on models and relative accuracy. Once good data is onboard and business problem is well defined, data scientist can work magics. AutoML will be highly productive in agile environment.. With say 2 to 3 weeks sprints each.",True
