@abhisheksharma8798,2023-09-20T23:20:30Z,8,"first differencing (of order=1) has been done to de-trend the data. Once it is de-trended, it should further be deseasonalised by differencing again (of order =12). Thus, we have original data-> order1 differencing -> order 12 differencing. The final data will now start from t=14, and it is then checked for stationarity by ADF. The values of PACF at lag=1, lag=12 (for the final transformed data, after two levels of differences) are comparatively higher than PACF values at other lags (as evident from figures). Thus p has been taken as 1, implying AR(1). actually it is written as 1,1,1,12. p is taken as 1, because it reflects the highest PACF value, means 1 lagged value is highly correlated with its subsequent value as compared to other lag values.",True
