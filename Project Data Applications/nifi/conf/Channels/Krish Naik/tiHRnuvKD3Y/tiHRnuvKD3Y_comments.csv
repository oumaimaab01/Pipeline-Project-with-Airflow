I  have a masters in  biotechnology with a whole biology background like I didn't even know if I wanted to become a doctor, but now I have no hopes and aspirations of continuing in that field. Don't have a job, still live with my parents and have almost no idea what I will do in my life. All I ever did was study and maintain good marks in my life but now this is weird waters! I didn't get a seat through NEET,  2 times and then I gave up, tried giving govt. exams, but that was not for me. Didn't clear gate and I don't think I've enough memory cells left to think about CSIR-NET. I am honestly scared to admit that I don't love the subject I've studied all my life and just cannot deal with it anymore. I was exploring options and came across krish and I think this is something I would really love to do. I just stop wanting to feel like shit and a total loser!

I forgot to mention I am a girl.I had option to marry too but got stuck with one boy only ,trusted him thinking he loves me bcz we got engaged before my brother death..but he left me alone after his death when he heard we have 150 Lacs debt...my mother asked him if he is ready to marry me now ..he bluntly droped the idea of marriage with me..may be bcz he was expecting dowry from my side and he came to know i left with no money..so here I am following Krish Naik sir and ineuron team so that again I stand up and b that woman which I wanted to be not for the sake of marriage or getting married but to keep my life busy with decent salary and experience.",True
