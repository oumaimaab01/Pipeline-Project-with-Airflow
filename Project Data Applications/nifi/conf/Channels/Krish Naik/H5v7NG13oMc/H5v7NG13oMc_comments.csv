What tool do you use for your online teaching which makes it easy to write on a board and math expressions - just like in a classroom? Any link will be appreciated. I am going into some online tutor sessions soon and I know it will come in handy. ( Planning on teaching someone math online).",True

Currently working in a CA firm in bangalore and learning data analytics skills like SQL, power Bi, etc. But whenever I search data analytics in finance domain which uses these skills, I find mostly titles like finance analyst which  mostly does not require these skills. So, I want to ask which profiles require these skills in finance domain and whether a degree in finance is required to work in those profiles.   Thanks in advance.",True
