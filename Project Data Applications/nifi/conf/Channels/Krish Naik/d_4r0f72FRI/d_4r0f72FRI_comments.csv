@AkshaySowdari,2023-02-28T08:48:03Z,1,"Also, 75% of books have only 3 ratings, if exclude books with ratings less than 100, then we'll lose huge amount of data right",True
@AkshaySowdari,2023-02-28T08:45:11Z,0,"Hi Krish, , U told to exclude books with ratings less than 100 right, so we have to consider ratingCount >= 100 but instead you've taken bookRating>=100",True

@ratanUtube1,2020-10-08T12:12:40Z,3,"Hi Krish, Great Content. Just one doubt from my side. In your cell number 11, I guess we need to do value count on ISBN column instead of bookRating like below.  counts1 = ratings['userID'].value_counts() ratings = ratings[ratings['userID'].isin(counts1[counts1 >= 200].index)] counts = ratings['ISBN'].value_counts() ratings = ratings[ratings['ISBN'].isin(counts[counts >= 100].index)]  as we are trying to eliminate the books which have been rated less than 100times. Please correct me if I am wrong.",True

Based on the content in this tutorial, can I say that no matter what kinds of recommender systems I will develop, the first step to go much be construct a pivot table which consists of the User IDs and Product IDs corresponding to the rows and columns in this table? Look forward to your reply. Thank you.",True
