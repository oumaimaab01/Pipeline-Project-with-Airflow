@nitheesh340,2021-10-26T08:31:10Z,1,"Nice Interview. Sahil was completely nervous and couldn't think clearly for most of the questions. He was getting confused between the actual logic and the implementation part. For the resume assistance problem, he kept talking about the algorithms, but he seldom spoke about how the data could be extracted from the resume and how that could be handled. Basically, he somehow kept forgetting about how to extract and label the data and concentrated mainly on the algorithm. Anyway 2 technical interviewers are definitely going to make anyone nervous. Even I would have got nervous and forgotten some of the concepts. At least this was a good experience for him and viewers like me. I am new to this field and started learning Data Science a few months back. Anyway I can conclude that the resume keywords play a key role in the interviews and concepts are more important.

@sourabhsharma9830,2020-12-17T14:21:20Z,2,"Answer to 2nd question- Central limit theorem can be used inference about population parameters (mu and sigma) from sample.  3rd que- Normalization means data points should lie between 0-10 and in standardization mean is 0 and SD is 1.  4th que- Z test is used when we are aware of the parameters of the population. On the other hand T test is used when population parameters are unknown. (in case if we have sample more than 30 we can use both the test)  5th - RMSE is worst for regression because...the error can be equal for a random mess and a perfectly aling polymial relationship.  6th- Linear reg is nothing but simple proportion. 1 kg rice is 200 rs and 2 kg rice 400 kg. So, for 3 kg rice price would be 600(here slope is 100).

Effectively and able to get results out of it ? 2.1 what are the outcome of statistical tests? 2.2 what are the outcomes of normal distribution? What assumptions do you make from Normal distribution? 3.If data is given to me and do statistical analysis to find out outliers and what is the approach u are going to take to make it a normally distributed data set? 3.1 approach to find out and approach to Handle  the outliers ? 3.2 without discarding how will you handle data? 3.3 what do you understand about normalisation? 3.4 what is the difference b/w normalisation and standardisation? 4. What is diff b/w Z statistics and T statistics where we are supposed to use that which one you r suppose to use and which one your are not supposed to use !? 4.1 can you please talk about diff b/w z and T in terms of standard deviation?  Machine learning concepts : 5. Why root mean square error some times call as a worst errored calculations in case of regression!? 5.1 what is the probable solution for where we have one data in one scale and other as another scale  6. Can you please talk about error function or loss function in logistic ? 7. What‚Äôs your fav algorithm? 7.1 if you have to teach me a linear or logistic regression happen how you gonna explain me ? 8. you‚Äôve worked on time series just tell me how you gonna do train test split ? 8.1 why sequential arranged ?

If have a problem statement you are a placement co ordinator you are facing a challenges there are many companies which used to visit your colleges and every company is having same set of requirements as a placement co ordinator you get stuck between company and student ! There are 1000 of resumes you have to map a correct resume to correct company ?  You have to solve it using Ml not NLP!? 10.1 if you take Dt how you are going to define classes  11.you have done one hot encoding to change categories in to numerical what if you have a category like pin code ? 11. 1Why do we convert categories to numerical  12.You‚Äôve built a NN how do u decide how many no of layers and hidden neurons to be used?(ans: keras tuner ) 12.1 why k fold cross validation is used? 12.2 what does cv is?,True

CLT states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes larger assuming that all samples are identical in size and regardless of population distribution shape..  Best part of this theorem in our real life problems is that regardless of distribution(i.e If we haven't idea about distribution of population) shape one can compute the probability of an event for that distribution using samples and CLT theorem  For a layman who is not from statistics stream Can understand it by one simple example-  Let we want to check what is the probability (i.e chance) that an Indains have income more than 50,000 then we can compute it using Central Limit theorem and sample (i.e a sub part population data) even we haven't idea about the distribution of income of Indians",True

Something like that and . Then I can make 10 models (no. Of companies coming for placement drive) , for each model we have output  But if there is any constraint that a single candidate can only appear for 3 or 4 interview, then we need to think further.  Now we have models ready with me ,and I have data as key skill of students , I will pass all these data to our model and i will measure the shortest distance of this data to each contraint line for specific model and sum it over all straight line boundary relating to each constarint like y>=6x1+3x2. And we will find such distance for all data(student skill) given in resume  of student and  then apply scaling so that  ranking of student can be done a/c to best suitable canditate , Similar thing can be done for all model .
