@singnsoul6443,2024-02-28T03:54:51Z,2,"When you write a Python script, you might want some parts of the code to execute only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module into another script.  The line if __name__ == ""__main__"": allows you to achieve this behavior. Here's how it works:  Direct Execution: When you run a Python script directly (by calling python script_name.py), the special variable __name__ is set to ""__main__"". This indicates that the script is being executed as the main program.  Imported as a Module: When you import a Python script into another script or interactive session, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module (i.e., the filename without the .py extension), not ""__main__"".",True

@hm2715,2023-07-04T05:43:06Z,8,"When you use the condition if __name__ == ""__main__"":, the code inside that block will only run if the current script is being directly executed as a standalone script.  If the script is imported as a module into another script, the code inside the if __name__ == ""__main__"": block will not run. This allows you to have certain code that should only execute when the script is run directly, but not when it is imported as a module.",True
