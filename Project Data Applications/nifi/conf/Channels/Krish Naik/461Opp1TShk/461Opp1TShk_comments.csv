@AmirAli-id9rq,2022-06-09T16:18:33Z,2,"at 1:11:31 , I guess its wrong if the model captures the good relationship(between dependent and independent variable) in data then it has low bias not high bias. Low bias means that model output the formula is flexible (low bias) to capture the relationship , high bias means that the accuracy is low and model is unable to capture the actual data points .. please verify guys",True
@AmirAli-id9rq,2022-06-09T15:30:15Z,15,"ek number session ... in easy terms ... BIAS is the inability of ML algorithm to capture the 100 percent or exact relationship. To understand bias one must think why do we need a ML in first place. In mathematics or physics we have absolute relationship or formula between dependent and independent variables like s=ut+1/2 at2 (std 7 Physics) or SI = P*R*T  so for computing cases like we have absolute formula we don't need any ML algo. ML try to do the same i.e. estimate a formula, let say I want to calculate the purchasing power (P) so I train a model with different variables like income,age, family income and m model fetches a formula  P = wo+ b1*income+b2*age + b3* family income..... So this formula is not absolute or universal as its derived by a specific ML algo for specific data but let say by miracle we derive a formula that exactly calculates the purchasing power with 100 percent accuracy so for that model bias is 0 as the model accurately captures the relationship..... Variance ---- Talking about variance, in short way the difference in fits between data set is called variance , imagine we used that same miracle formula in test data and data fits 100 percent as in we get 100 percent accuracy(for different test set) then we can say that the variance is 0 which means the ML formula is perfect or let say when use the same miracle formula in test set we get 50% accuracy which means the bias was low but variance is high as formula didnt work well with unseen (test) data... SO in an imaginary world if bias is 0 and variance is also 0 then my friend you have discovered a formula not an estimation .... In a practical world we aim for a model with low bias and low variance..... Subscribe Krish Channel if this helped",True
