I imagine it as a transform to your inputs doing a Relu and then that info you pass to the next layer, but you loss all inputs that are less than zero since with the StandarScaler transformation you would transform  certain data and obtain data with negative values. It not will better just apply Dense (with no activation) on the Input Layer?",True
