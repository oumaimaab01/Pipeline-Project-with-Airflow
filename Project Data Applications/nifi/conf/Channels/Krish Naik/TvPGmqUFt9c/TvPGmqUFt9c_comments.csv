@mayanktripathi4u,2019-12-24T00:36:28Z,0,"Hi Krish, one quick question on the real world problem. Till now we do get the train and (or) test data-set.. and we do make a model (after various feature engineering process) using train data-set and if test dataset available then we can predict the model.Till here i am good. But the question is, in real world, test data-set or real world data will be directly processed on the model, and we may not be doing the same featuring engineering on this real data. How are we going to handle such scenario? Please guide.   I may be missing something... but please correct me as well.",True
