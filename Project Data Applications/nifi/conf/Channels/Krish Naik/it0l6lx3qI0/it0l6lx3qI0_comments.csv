@brytonkalyi277,2023-12-08T04:32:50Z,0,"<\> I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray... God bless you as you share this message to others.",True

@Data_Jockey,2023-12-07T12:54:39Z,0,"Fun Fact I asked Google Bard to watch this video and Summarize it  and it did in seconds  #AI_to_Learn_AI  Prompt I Gave : summaries this YouTube video for me   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0l6lx3qI0   Answer by Bard  Here is a summary of the video:  Gemini is a new AI large language model (LLM) developed by Google AI. It is a multimodal model, meaning it can process and understand text, images, videos, audio, and code. Gemini is said to be more accurate than GPT-4, another popular LLM.  Here are some of the key features of Gemini:  Accuracy: Gemini is said to be more accurate than GPT-4 on a variety of tasks, including language understanding, reasoning, and code generation. Multimodality: Gemini can process and understand text, images, videos, audio, and code. This makes it more versatile than other LLMs that can only process text. Safety: Google has taken steps to ensure that Gemini is used safely and ethically. For example, Gemini Pro will not process images that contain human faces. Availability: Gemini will be available in Google AI Studio starting December 13th. It can be used with Google Cloud Vertex and integrated into applications. Overall, Gemini is a powerful new LLM that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. It is more accurate, versatile, and safe than other LLMs, and it will be available to developers soon.  Would you like to know more about Gemini? üòÄüòÉ",True

@abhi9029,2023-12-07T10:30:54Z,0,"Google already was ahead in AI. It's just it's difficult for google to experiment. OpenAI tells google indirectly that people are accepting AI models in day to day life. So, google knows that yes we can not launch our own models.  Previously I know that once google release such model after chatGPT and the model gives wrong answer and google lost some Billions of dollars. So, google has to take care many things at once. Unlike OpenAI which was a startup company at that time and didn't has any reputation like google, they can take risk in releasing the model and model giving wrong output. But in case of google it's very very risky. But now google is like, let's go all in after doing so many experiments and witnessing how AI rises.  BTW good video Krish. I am also keeping myself up to date with AI news.",True
