@NaveenSingh-js6ts,2021-01-09T04:31:47Z,0,"Sir, Why there's is almost no job for python developer in India, specially for freshers... I have tried JAVA, C and Python & Python is the language I like the most but seeing no jobs in the market really demotivates me. I don't know if I should continue with python or switch to Java... Your advice will be really helpful. Thank you",True

@vahiagyat,2021-01-08T09:19:33Z,30,"Adding my 2 cents and summarizing it: From the jobs perspective, it's important to understand we have two kinds of categories in data science/ML hiring.  One, which I call it, mass data science hiring - it's not that they hire in mass but the skill that the company is looking for is a very generic one. As Krish explained - you just need to implement the use case. What's expected from you is that you understand the existing algorithms/models and are able to implement a real-life use case. For example, adding an image search functionality in your product - it's a straightforward use case but your normal developers might not be able to do it because this too requires knowledge of CNN etc. and you have to tweak the model as per need. But still, this doesn't require you to have a deep knowledge of how CV or the complete mathematics behind it.  The second category is, research-based, this is not necessarily a ""research"" job but what I mean by research-based is that just having the knowledge to implement a use case with a pre-existing model will not do the job here. It need not be only Facebook Google etc. recently I saw jobs from smaller companies too which were looking for a 'researcher' kind of data scientist. You need to know everything about the model, mathematics, and implementation everything so that you can utilize the same concept or change something in the concept side to make that model working for you or come up with completely new models or concepts! These works are worthy of white papers and many of such work has become the base for the new revolution for example - backpropagation, which is a fundamental concept now - it came as paper by David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams. Having said that it doesn't mean that they expect you to invent every time.  You need to tweak the model in both kinds of jobs - but the kind of tweaking and complexity needed will be very different.  Whether To-Do Masters/Ph.D. or not? Doing Masters certainly help in shortening the span of going from mass data scientist to niche data scientist. (not always). IT helps in getting the DS/ML jobs too even if you don't have prior experience in the field. Many companies have this criterion so your cv will be weeded out if you don't have an MS. So it definitely helps. Additionally, it helps by providing a defined curriculum and when you study in a group you are motivated and are on target.  But it does require - time and money. Depending on what stage of life you are it may or may not be feasible for you.  PhD - Don't go for the Ph.D. just for a job - you won't be able to sustain it. Believe me, a Ph.D. requires lots of patience and dedication. Go for that only if you truly like research and that field. Post Ph.D. definitely you will be getting good offers in the fields which are still growing - one of my friends post his Ph.D. got a job in Alexa Vernacular model (Vernacular - local language). By just having knowledge of the standard model it might be hard to get into this kind of job that too without too much experience in the field. Of course, if you can showcase the same kind of knowledge without a Ph.D. you have the chance but a degree helps the recruiter in weeding out the unwanted candidates.",True
