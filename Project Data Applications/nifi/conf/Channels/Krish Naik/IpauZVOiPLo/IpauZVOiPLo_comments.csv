@veerasrikanth3556,2020-02-10T18:27:45Z,12,"Hi, This is gonna be long...  Data: Monthly Climate Data (Rainfall [Min, Max, Mean..], Temperature [Min, Max, Mean..], Soil Type,       (Condition Of soil etc.,), timestamp variable(Month and Year), Location (State and [City or town]) Dependent variable that we need to predict Tea Production (How much Tea is Produced Monthly) Time: We have data for the past 10 years and monthly so total points in data are 120 per location (per soli type might also be included). Background: This problem has to be solved by a Data Scientist, where he or she might not have any Domain or Background Knowledge about the problem (here tea production).  My opinion is that Research about the domain and gain knowledge which will be very helpful in finding insights or guessing if an outlier is really an outlier or justifying or knowing whether the results that we got are correct.  Knowledge: I have done some research on this domain and found these points which might be useful for our problem Tea plants are planted in Monsoon(beginning in late May or early June and also depends upon region ) Plucked throughout the year but, production is high after monsoons Generally Pucked using hand or using some special kind of tool  Key points that effect apart from Climate and Soil are WorkForce   Area of Production  Labour  Machinery (for cutting or Machinery in local factories) Step 1: Filling Missing Values: Since the data is related to the climate and if there are some missing values then   An obvious and efficient way can be collecting thorough other sources or climate-related APIs based on location. If this doesn‚Äôt work use the following: A Nieve step can be filling it with means of the previous month‚Äôs value (maybe two months average) Another way can be since it is a monthly data fill it with previous years same months average.  (Ex: A missing value of temperature in Feb will be most likely to be average of previous    year‚Äôs Feb temperature) A little complicated Methods can be like building a linear regression model or KNN (or even Decision Tree)and impute the missing value.  I would prefer b point.  Step 1.1: Feature Engineering: Here creating new features can be based on the idea that tea production not only depends upon the current month‚Äôs variables but also on the previous month‚Äôs  Ex: [Max, Min, Mean] [Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity etc., ] in the last K months. Here K can be 2,3 or even 4 what variables to pick will be decided by the model Comes in hand to handle any unpredictable even like Drought or Floods whose effect will last long.   Step 2: Building a model: Things that we need to take care of:   This model is for production so any process or variables that we take used for model building should be available that‚Äôs why point ‚Äúa. In step 1‚Äù used only previous value but not the next months.  Method 1: Botton Line at the top (BLOT): Build a Time series model on overall data points (with respect to time component).  As expected a base naive model can be  Build a time series model with the dependent variable (by averaging based on month for all regions) Here which model to use ARIMA, LSTM or even Fourier Transform we will know based on the Efficiency, Predictability and Explainability.  Method 2: BLOT: Build a separate-separate Time series model on each location. The production of tea is based upon the location which in turn based on climate, soil, water and other features‚Ä¶ So, building a separate time series based on location makes sense and not that hard for production If anything goes wrong we have command and knowledge about what is happening and this is a major perk and helps the company to make decisions if anything goes wrong. And of course, the last line about which algorithm to use in Method 1 is applicable here.  Method 3: I doubt about this one but worth trying‚Ä¶ BLOT: Solve it as a regression problem by trying to predict next month‚Äôs outcome. If we think like building a supervised ML model straight away and try to predict the tea yield this won‚Äôt work on the production cause we would get the data simultaneously with respect to time.  Ex: We would get the data both independent features and dependent feature at the end of the month so building a straight away model won‚Äôt do the job. Solution 1: Here one small trick can be like a month‚Äôs independent features and try to predict the yield of next month. Prepare the dataset in such a way  Ex: An instance or a row in this dataset should be like independent features of the month Jan and the dependent feature should be the TEA PRODUCTION OF NEXT MOTNH ie., FEB In this way, this can be used in production. Now this is a supervised problem so you can try building ensembles or stacking models And also here we can use Method 1 and Method 2 (building overall model and building model per location)  My suggestion is using a non-black box method so that we can justify the prediction.  Additional tip: Try to build a CART model with very very less depth(say 3) and see which features are being picked and build a model for each leaf. Ex: say it picked location as a root node and next soil type as 2nd then build models (Method 1,2 or even 3) on each subset of data.

@pradeepgopishetty3463,2020-02-10T18:14:14Z,0,First will select data based on region and try to do Exploratory data analysis and figure out the interdependence between the features with target variables.. will do similar kind of activity for other regions.. After EDI will get basic understanding of the data behavior for each region. Will do a simple linear regression model based on the out put will compare the real solution and my predicted values.. once the comparison is done will go for time series and apply ensambling regression techniques,True
@narenderbansal5741,2020-02-10T14:30:21Z,3,"It's time series problem.By using all the predictors we can easily predict the our tea production after applying features engineering. So we can go either with Multivariate Time Series ‚Äì Vector Auto Regression (VAR) or LSTM because we can capture the trend , seasonality from previous month production along with predictors by using Time plot.",True

@tamilselvan8385,2020-02-10T05:27:26Z,7,"In my opinion, first i go with K- means clustering  to group the similar places across India with respect to rainfall and temperature (Because climate condition in India differ from place to place). Then with cook's d statistic i try to remove influential observation for every clusters. since i have one of my feature (months) as 'factor' i go with Random Forest Regression for each clusters.  hence, i can easily predict production across different similar places in India.",True
@skumarr53,2020-02-09T19:13:18Z,2,"It's time series problem. To deal with such problem we could try regression model with climate and soil fertility Indicators using min,  max, mean aggregated over month as predictors since its time series we can also consider previous month production as one of the predictor.  If we have large amount of data we can also use neural network such as LSTM or ensemble of both this and regression. If model interpretation is prime focus then Regression may be better choice.",True
@saiprasadpadhy,2020-02-09T18:59:14Z,13,First we have to predict tea production depends on various independent features by using any regression technique. Then we can use Time series forecasting models to predict tea production on monthly basis.,True
@abhishekab8014,2020-02-09T18:33:36Z,5,"I think what the business is interested in ? Some particular breed of tea are processed for production.With the help of clustering geographic data we can get to know the required areas , the climate conditions, the soil conditions etc. For Tea Crop we have to check the correlation between variables with the Tea Yielding . As it's an annual or monthly data we have to see the Trend , seasonality etc.by Time plot. We can go for Multi Linear Regression to predict the Yielding of Tea Crop depending on climate, soil , genetic conditions. If Yielding rate or amount is present in the data and we want to see what's the next month production or Yielding we can go for ARIMA model to forcast the next yield.",True
