@abhaygodbole6628,2021-06-06T13:34:57Z,2,"Hello Krishna, I have subscribed you Chanel and started with this Sage Maker series. I could see many play list right from ML/ DL basics, I would go thru these as well as I have forgotten many things.  I am working in AI/ML from last 5 years...  I have one question ... as I said I am in this domain for 5 years now, what I observed is, the number of project that we get is very less, all things are getting  stopped at PoC and that number is also very less... I  kind of started thinking is ML/DL  just a Hype, because during this 5 years I haven't got a chance where I used real time large datasets and productionised    any ML/DL model. It would be great if you share your views. I am planning to get my AWS ML Speciality certification after my AWS SA Associate certification and try for a job change... but the issue is I have now 18+ years of IT experience out of which 5+ years in Data Science/ML and may be because of that I am not getting even interview calls or may be there is some issue with my Resume.. I need to work on it..... So I am  in dilemma whether to pursue ML Speciality , would it be worth putting efforts and money  or should I target SA Pro which would give me wider spectrum, but issue is I don't have experience in this area... It would be great if you share your inputs.",True
