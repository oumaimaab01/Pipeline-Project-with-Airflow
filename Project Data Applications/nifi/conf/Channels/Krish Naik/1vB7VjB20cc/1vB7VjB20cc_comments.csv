@simran1277,2022-06-30T02:22:52Z,23,"1st distribution: Pareto Distribution (power law probability distribution, talks about 80-20 rule i.e. 80% of outcomes are result of 20% causes)   Convert pareto distribution to normal distribution: using box cox transformation (it converts to nearly normal distribution, formula is:  x_new = log(x_old) if lambda = 0 x_new = (x_old**lambda - 1)/lambda otherwise)   Check if distribution is normal gaussian distribution or not: Draw QQ plots (Quantile-Quantile plot) where we draw actual quantiles for data and theoretical quantiles and then look at deviation.   What is standard normal distribution? Normal distribution with mean 0 and std 1   Plot A: Right Skewed mean > median > mode Plot B: Left Skewed mode > median > mean  Difference between fit_transform and transform fit_transform do two operations on input data in one go which are fit the transformer as per the calculations on input data and then apply those calculations to input data transform: will only apply calculations on input data as per transformer.  When we use fit_predict and what is it? fit_predict fits the model as per input data and later on make a prediction as well using trained model. We generally use it in clustering algorithms like DBSCAN where we can only do fit_predict or fit. Predict is not possible there.   What is difference between standardization and normalization? 1. Normalization is basically min max scaling 2. Values belong to [0,1] or [-1,1] 3. Affected by outliers 4. Useful when we don't know about distribution   1. Standardization converts data in a manner that mean of transformed data is 0 and std=1 2. No bound on values 3. Not much affected by outliers 4. Useful when data distribution is normal gaussian distribution.  PS: Do correct me if I went wrong somewhere.",True

@nik7867,2022-06-29T01:38:02Z,2,RNNâ€™s can work on sentences having small length as there hasnâ€™t been any significant change in weights with respect to distance among the words and the context is preserved . Am I correct ?,True
