@sandeepkesri9597,2020-12-06T15:40:42Z,6,"Sir, i am a finance professional having around 9+ years of experience with companies like HSBC, Credit Suisse, Moody's. i just know excel to analyse my data and a bit of VBA macros to automate my tasks. Now I want to uplift myself.   I came to know certain tools available like power BI, python, tableau etc which could help me either to better visualise my data or automate my task. I work on huge chunk of data set. When i searched on internet i see enormous number of courses like data science, machine learing, AI which talk about coding, programming and many IT jargons. I am a CFA. My core is finance.   I want these tools just to better and faster analyse my data or to automate my tasks. Please suggest me which course should i go for my domain. Do i need to be programmer to use these tools for my required my tasks.  Hope i explained my problem clearly.",True
