@chessfreak8813,2021-10-15T07:33:16Z,0,Perfectly amazing video Krish!!!! You have been THE guide in my journey. Just a little problem with this particular website that you showed I created mywebcam and i trained a bottle image in 2nd webcam so trained the model. But if suppose I show mobile instead of the bottle then also it shows 100% for bottle. So if I dont show myself in the webcam then bound to show the bottle 100% is that it? please clear this doubt for me if you see this comment.   Thank you in advance! God bless you!,True

@BiancaAguglia,2020-05-12T23:21:12Z,38,"What you said about reverse engineering makes perfect sense.  üòäAs you said, the main reason a Google (or FB, or Microsoft) model can beat most other models is that Google has more compute power. I've heard teachers from institutions like MIT, Stanford, etc saying that their PhD students couldn't win ML or DL competitions simply because the big companies had better compute power. Of course, there are always exceptions. Better architectures can create better models. All things being equal though, more powerful computers give better accuracy.    When you reverse engineer a very good model you get at least two benefits from that:    1. you get in your own application the great performance of that model    2. you understand more about ML and, who knows, you figure out ways to improve an already great model. üòä",True
