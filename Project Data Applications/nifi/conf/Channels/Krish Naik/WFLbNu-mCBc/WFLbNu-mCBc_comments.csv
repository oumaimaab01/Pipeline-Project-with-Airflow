@shumetietefera527,2024-01-06T07:46:53Z,1,"Using fit_transform() on both the training and test data separately is not recommended. The purpose of the fit_transform() method is to compute the necessary parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation for standardization) based on the training data and then apply the transformation. Using it separately on the test data might lead to information leakage, where the transformation is influenced by statistics computed from the test set, potentially compromising the generalization performance of your model. @1:03, U used fit_transform() for test data too!!! It's OK as you already told as the main concept in the first example",True

Btw if X is zero meaning weight is zero then intercept will be y value like how is this possible doesn't that sound logically incorrect ? man with 0 weight having 156 height ü§£,True

@nomadabhinay8863,2023-09-16T01:33:53Z,2,"Hi Krishna, In simple Linear Regression you told that we should not do fit_transform() to X_test, but in Multilinear Regression Why are we taking fit_transform (X_test)?? shouldn't it be just transform(X_test)?",True
@1tridibdey,2023-09-03T11:33:52Z,3,Hi kris really appreciate the details in your video. Just wanted to point out something that in multiple linear regression at the time of standard scaler u have done fit transform for test and train.,True
