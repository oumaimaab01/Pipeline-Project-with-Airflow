@matattz,2023-08-14T11:51:40Z,1,"Honestly what helped me the most was the mindset that learning the basics like pandas, numpy, seaborn etc are just TOOLS you have to master for the actual Data Science things you want to do. Don‚Äôt dive to deep into those things, you can and will become better over time but you have to actually start practicing with it!! Start a project and apply the things you learned. Then step by step try and understand the theory behind Machine Learning, start with the book Data Science for Business by Foster Provost. It‚Äôs an amazing entry for beginners to grasp the overall concept and how you need Data Science in the business world. Next you should read, practical statistics for Data Scientists. Also beginner friendly but very good to read. After that read Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit learn. Amazing book and more advanced then t he other ones, that‚Äôs when you start to get more into the math behind ML. Parallel to that book you can start watching the machine learning playlist from Bloomberg here on YouTube to understand how the Algorithms work exactly and what you need to do for optimization. This is we‚Äôre you also want to get practical, and I would recommend the book xGBoost from Matt Harrison. Great great book ! To get an expert at Pandas you should definitely also check out his Book effective pandas. A life saver.  And the most important thing, you already found one of the best tutors for practical Machine Learning in Krish, keep watching his videos and you are good.  Next you can learn Deep Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera or watch many videos for free here on YouTube. He‚Äôs an absolute legend and you should definitely check him out.   If you do all of this, trust me you will become a weapon and  you are on an amazing path!",True
