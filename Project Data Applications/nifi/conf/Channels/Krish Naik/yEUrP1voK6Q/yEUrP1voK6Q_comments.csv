@BiancaAguglia,2019-10-21T09:19:20Z,8,"Two more things that might help get a job:    1. Go to meetups of local entrepreneurs. See if you can help with some of the problems they talk about. It can lead to freelance work or a job offer. ðŸ˜Š    2. Read as much as possible about a company you'd like to work for (their website, their social media content, etc). You can get many ideas of problems they're working on. Choose one of those problems and show how you'd solve it, then find a way to contact them with your solution. (For example, a news agency was recently looking for help with analyzing data related to the Flint, MI drinking water contamination and presenting in a visually compelling way. That would be an interesting and useful project to work on.)",True
