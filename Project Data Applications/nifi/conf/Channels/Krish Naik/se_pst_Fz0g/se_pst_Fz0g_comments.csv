I covered basic coding languages like C,C++ and DBMS in our curriculum.  I'm from 2014 batch and supposed to finish it in 2018. Due to health conditions, I got a gap of 2 years and I would graduate by the end of this year.  I've started IBM data science cert. in coursera. I set a goal that by the end of jan 2021, I must land a job in Data science. I want to celebrate my next birthday(23 feb) as a Data scientist!   So my question is this: 1. Will I be able to get a job despite having 2 years gap?  2. How should I plan my learning path to achieve my goal?  3. How to get hands-on practice on real world data using free resources?  4. How to create our own effective portfolio?  5. Anything else that I should do to achieve my goal?   Your guidance is much needed.
