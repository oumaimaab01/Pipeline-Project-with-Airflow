The very fact that you this is even a discussion shows that even AI jobs is going to taken over by Computer Science guys. For business owners building software on top of Generative AI that taps into their domain is a great value. For this they would hire Computer Science guys.,True

@devawratvidhate9093,2024-02-05T02:57:42Z,2,When i started  using Midjourney and Dall E 3  for image generation i though it wont match the artists but within year I could say it outperform  what I expected. I think its not far away probably within 2 years it can  outperform majority of coder. entry point for coding will be low here after. Also where you mentioned lot of different cases for ML it wil be handed by Ai Agents. Pretty much every digital task. There improvements rate is exponential so humans can not match that.,True

@madhavpr,2024-02-05T02:35:13Z,8,"Good morning Krish. Very nicely summarized.  Gen AI is a a family of tools with its strength and limitations. Just like you can't use a rocket launcher for killing a mosquito, you can't use generative AI for every use case. Secondly, as data scientists, I feel that our primary objective is to make sense of data and how to interpret the results properly. So irrespective of whatever algorithms we use, we need to find out if the results make sense or not. (of course, we also need to know the ins and outs of the algorithms too)",True
