@peterslater2914,2024-03-08T05:39:34Z,0,"Many thanks for this, it clarifies to me that Cnn is not a mystery as it was before seeing this video. As a person that worked in image processing and is quite up with edge detection like Roberts and Sobell, contrast stretching and like this a formulation of all those into the units or segments and classification into one is really smart. In the 1980's we had to write our own batch processes to do the same thing. Now it's simple just in a matter of a call of few libraries and Walla it's done. I wonder whether someone could answer a question I have on saving the compiled model or is this explained in The Transfer Learning. I also would like to use my own filter that I developed years ago to produced an image that produced a contour of increasing darkness of pixels toward the centre that is the centroid of an object. I want to be able to create a model on blobs and use my own filter.",True
