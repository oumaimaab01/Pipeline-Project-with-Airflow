@revathiboopathi8883,2022-11-29T23:29:51Z,0,"Hi Krish, I have a question.   So, we are normalizing all numerical fields which will make it in the range 0 to 1. While encoding categorical variables, we ""one hot encode"" a few which will make them either 0 or 1. However, there are a few categorical fields where we are ""label encoding"" as order matters. It would be encoded like 1,2,3,4,.... which is not in the 0 to 1 range unlike the first and second case that I had discussed. I would like your advice here whether I need to normalize after label encoding the data and range of this case alone won't be in 0 to 1 and normalizing would make it in 0 to 1 range.",True

Let‚Äôs suppose I have a feature which has 1000 different categories which I need to convert to either an integer/float how should I do that?Here I can‚Äôt go for one hot encoding as it might create 999 columns.And also it has only 1100 record /rows by which even though going by the ‚Äúone hot encoding with multiple categories‚Äù method the most repeated categories will be extremely less how do we handle it in such cases?   2. In Ordinal encoding why are the ranks need to be assigned to a categorical label instead we can give some random unique number to the categorical values without ranking them for example PhD as 1 , BE as 2, Masters as 4 and Stats as 3.   3. Also regarding  ‚ÄúLabel Encoding‚Äù how are the ranks decided say if PhD needs to be given higher rank let‚Äôs suppose ‚Äò4‚Äô how can a library know that it should be given a higher rank?
