Time to start Deep Learning...   1) AutoWEKA is an approach for the simultaneous selection of a machine learning algorithm and its hyperparameters; combined with the WEKA package it automatically yields good models for a wide variety of data sets.  2) Auto-sklearn is an extension of AutoWEKA using the Python library scikit-learn which is a drop-in replacement for regular scikit-learn classifiers and regressors. 3) TPOT is a data-science assistant which optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. 4) H2O AutoML provides automated model selection and ensembling for the H2O machine learning and data analytics platform. 5) TransmogrifAI is an AutoML library running on top of Spark. 6) MLBoX is an AutoML  library with three components: preprocessing, optimisation and prediction. 7)  and many more.....",True
