Reasons: it's new tech and obviously it's the future specially ai, but if you would learn ai then you would notice that there is a specific way of doing everything in ai and if you are doing something else then it basically counts as research and you need to be that good to be counted in that. Now there will be a software library of everything else which data scientists are doing and then it would be merged with software industry. Only few companies are actually leveraging the real ml potential and others are just doing basic stuffs in ai.  In my opinion, in future both the fields will get merged. It's distict only till the time when new researches are going on into ml and when it would develop a base then it would be common and there would be so many libraries around which anybody would be able to use.",True
@MrLee-gj2jz,2021-01-03T13:50:03Z,1,"Hard Skills of Data Science => programming skill + stats + math + algorithms + data visualization + experience on cloud service (AWS / Azure / GCP) + domain expertise. In 2012, Harvard published the ""sexiest job of the 21st century"" article that popularized the data scientist term. 9 years later, employees with this killer combination of skills are so rare that they are still referred to as unicorns. Most companies feel that the skill combinations overlap greatly in CS / Signal Processing / Math / Stats / Physics PhDs and they are partially right. It is quite easy to get a CS / SP / Math / Stats / Physics Ph.D. and get them up to speed on AWS + Tableau  / Azure + Qlikview or whatever the company uses in a few months. For others, it can be a steep learning curve as the typical Indian B.Tech degree syllabus in Mechanical, Civil, Chemical, Architecture has little in common with the required Data Science Hard Skills. The past few years have seen a spurt in scientific research and new journals focusing on the mathematics of data science. We can safely say that data science is no hype. Looking at the 2020 articles in SIAM's journal of Mathematics of Data Science (https://epubs.siam.org/toc/sjmdaq/2/1), I see topics like Graph Theory, Non-convex optimization, stochastic processes, persistent homology.

@vahiagyat,2021-01-02T19:36:44Z,10,"@Krish Naik: There are multiple aspects to this question. You did a good job but I would like to add a few points to this.  First and foremost - ""it's very important to understand what they mean by hype?"" Are they saying data science and related field is not going to last or it's all talk but no action? OR  do they mean it's a reality but it's been hyped by the companies and educational institutes?  For the people who claim the first part - as you also mentioned, they actually don't have a clear understanding of the Data Science field. Under this comes the first category, who are in majority, they don't have a clue what Data Science is and how does it work. For them, it's a magic wand that works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. And IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO REJECT WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO CHANGE. I have experience with some senior management, not in my current company, who thought bots logic is just 'IF and ELSE rules'. So, why do we need an NLP or data, science expert? HE was still better as he had some idea of bots (wrong or right that's a different story). I pity and kinda get pissed on those, who have no clue but they just heard someone else say so they are also repeating the same. Then there is another category, who have half baked information and they believe what they know is the ultimate truth.   The LAST CATEGORY THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THIS DIRECTLY LINKS TO THE THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION. These are the people who see what the majority of data scientists (that they know) are doing in their jobs. AND WHEN I SAY DATA SCIENTISTS THEN THAT MEANS SOMEONE WITH THE ""DESIGNATION OF DATA SCIENTIST"".  Yes, in most of the companies the data scientist label is used very broadly and vaguely and that creates more confusion. For example, if I don't know about data science but I see data scientists just doing some standard old dashboards in some new tech - I would think Data Science is hype; we have been doing this under, let's say data warehousing or ETL, etc., for so long. AND THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY WRONG.  I feel this has created a big- big confusion and wrong perception. I had a discussion with a director-level person who thinks (still he does) it's old wine in a new bottle. I feel for most of the part - HR and Companies are responsible for this. Because it's a buzz word nowadays, every company is putting ""data Science"" opening.  The first category is the companies who are hiring just to do what others are doing - I personally know companies that have no use cases but they are hiring data scientists. What do you think will happen to those hired data scientists? They will wait for projects, then slowly to have a better utilization they will be given some random work which has something to do with 'analytics', and they will continue like this for quite some time.  The second category is of those who are clear from starting for what they are hiring is not exactly is a data science job but they will give designation. And many people will apply because it's THE HOT JOB in the market! The same fate for these people too.   So, people who see them and people who went through this - will have a very different perception of data science.   Last but not the least, recently there has been so much surge in the courses for Data science just because it's the current buzz word and everyone wants to learn this. But believe me, 70-80% of these courses are given by people who themselves don't have a clear understanding and many times they don't even have practical knowledge of the subject itself. Without naming anyone, I know someone who just after doing a course together with me started his own coaching for data science!!! You get a certificate and build some luring model and do good digital marketing and bang - you can easily get a handful of the students! But honestly, what will be the preparation level of these students? When they go for an interview - what will happen? Because of this, it's becoming very difficult even for recruiters - Everyone is now mentioning EXPERT IN ML, NLP, CV, DL etc., and most of the time it's all air no matter!  To weed out these people some times HR go overboard and put some unrealistic requirement for a job - honestly, they are not that much experienced (most of them)  in Data Science or new tech. So they mix it up - recently I was reading a job description that required 8 years of experience in NLP, DL, and CV. I am not saying it's not possible but it sounded like they are looking for someone with the total experience of the same experience in these areas. On further investigation, I found out - first the person has to go back and check with the hiring manager :) and then he said, they are looking for 8 years but even 3-4 years will do!   So, there are many aspects that are creating this image of Data Science is hype! Yes, it's hype if you are talking with respect to what most of the companies are hiring for and making a hired data scientists do! But if you are talking the actual Data Science field in itself - then NO WAY it's a hype -  it's going flourish only, NOT going to die :)  You were mentioning regarding the Gartner, I agree with you - I work with Gartner, Forrester (another leader in this area) closely to get all the latest reports, so even in 2020 end reports what they are projecting for 2021 is RPA and AI is going to be the top tech. I will not go into the details of that but if you see last 1 year's top 10 startups RPA and AI startups are the majority. Just to clarify - old fashion automation is now getting a little stale, now RPA is mixed with AI, few call it Cognitive RPA (We love to coin fancy terms!).   My 2 cents to aspirants- spend some time to gain practical experience and don't rush for an interview with half-baked concepts. And when interviewing with a company be clear and firm on your job expectations. Many times, freshers or career switcher agrees for anything as long as they are getting the data scientists tag! Believe me, that's going to come back and bite you. Maybe you will even start hating the field and will move to the other field. Go for companies who actually are into AI/Data Science/RPA etc. And I read many freshers or people with no experience in data science asking how to get the job if everyone asks for 3-4 years. Krish has shared in one of the videos I guess. I would just suggest - don't always target for data scientists job, it's very rare you will be given that designation without proposer experience or unless you showcase some good projects - if you're already working try to transition within the company - that's much easier. or target for associate DS or maybe even Analyst (depending upon the company the JD varies).",True

Also there is lack of experienced data scientists who can guide the young talents in development. And hence due to this there are constant developments, they are not able to freeze the product and the company struggles to generate stable revenue.

Fighting about technologies and skills won't bring anything good to the table. Imagine being the best in some skill and google releases some feature that you can just use their API. It happens.",True

@sohamdutta5763,2021-01-02T15:17:52Z,32,"It's overhyped to an extent and institutes are fooling us to make money.  Having said that AI/data science is filled with buzzwords which requires foundation l maths only  . So you don't actually need to do a course in DS.   By calling themselves Data scientists, people are running packages which can be done by anybody.   So I don't really feel it's a skill. Some jobs are there but there isn't excess.The only real skill is data analysis which has been there in the industry for ages. Yes, companies do fool clients by using the term AI.",True

@hemantsharma7986,2021-01-02T14:28:26Z,114,"Yes, it's hype...Only a handful of people are getting a job and then when you say if u work hard you'll get a job. Then it's the same for every other domain. It's the same for even IAS...if you work hard you'll get a selection. Data science is the word that has been misused by lots to the institution just to gain profits (Ineuron not being one). Please do the poll on how many people are preparing for becoming a data scientist and how many have successfully transitioned. When you talk about 69% of the workload will be reduced. Only a handful of people can do that. Rest everyone will be just building dashboards. Learning dashboard is not a skill even 10th pass can learn that. Mastering machine learning is a skill that is very difficult and people need to know this. And only a handful of people will be successful. That the truth ....",True
