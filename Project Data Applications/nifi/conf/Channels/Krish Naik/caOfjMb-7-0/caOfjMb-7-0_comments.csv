@aravinthmegnath3569,2023-02-24T03:28:11Z,0,"Definitely we should reduce the false positives, because in this case if we send the coupons to the customers which is actually not going to purchase above 5000 but our model predicted that he/she will purchase.",True
@karishmadhende9422,2021-09-28T20:52:33Z,0,"FN should be reduced. If we don't want to loose valueable customers.

@aviranawat,2021-06-14T12:35:06Z,10,"So If I assume,  FP, in this case, is: Our model predicted that the customer would spend more than 5K, but in reality, he/she didn't, then the company's coupon may trigger him or her to buy this time, thereby adding new customers. The only drawback which I think in this case would be some coupons might get wasted as the original customer was never interested in our products.  FN, in this case, is: Our model predicted that the customer would not spend more than 5K, but in reality, he/she does spend more than that. In this case, the customer was anyway buying the products from the site.  But if he got news from his/her friends (who aren't shopaholics) that they got coupons. It may lead this customer to start purchasing from a new account or a different site.  Seems like FN is more important as original customers are getting lost, if not given benefits. If we correctly identify them and give them the coupons and benefits. It would trigger others who are shopaholics but aren't spending much on this site, to buy even more for extra benefits. Do let me know your view.",True

But looks like company is trying to maximize its profit by only targeting the customer with purchases > 5k and avoid to customers < 5k . so avoiding the < 5k customer takes importance ... so we can try to reduce the False Positives.  the features we can look for is - Purchases value during sales , purchases value during festive seasons , Purchase value using coupons as these do tend to correlate more with our end goal . other factors like Age , cart value , monthly visits cannot be considered without looking at the actual data.",True
@danielsharma3044,2021-06-05T05:04:47Z,1,False negatives are those customers which the company is going to skip as they’ll be shown as not buying the products worth 5k dollars but in actuality they’re the potential customers  false positive are those customers who are not going to buy 5000 dollars worth of products and will be sent those coupons. Now it makes sense to reduce false negatives because they’re the target customers that we don’t wanna miss and even if false positive increases and some of those customers buy 5k worth of products just to use those coupons it will be an added profit.,True

@vaibhavyaramwar,2021-06-04T12:50:43Z,0,"My answer would be, it depends on customer base like  If we have many customers who are spending more than 5000 then I would go with reducing False Positive  On other hand if we have less customer base who spending less than 5000 in that case these are minority customers and lossing such customers are having high risk in such case I will go with False Negative  In short if My dataset is balanced I will go with reducing False Positive and If my dataset is imbalanced I will go with reducing False Negative",True

@gauravpatil2926,2021-06-04T03:46:42Z,2,😀Of course need to reduce False Positive...🔵 Then and only then company can save its coupons for right people.. False positive means your model predicted positive (will spend 500$) result which is  turned out tobe negative (that person will not spend 500$) and in that case company unnecessarily would give them coupons which user wont gonna use them.. Means its overall loss to the company. Hence they should reduce FP so as chamces of issuing coupons to wrong people will be reduce and company can save its money...,True

And the answer is Type-2 error i.e. False Negative...Since in false negative tell us Actual value is true but predicted is false..and if that's the condition then we will probably not send the coupons to our regular customer and we might loose the customer base.

@amarpratapsingh4806,2021-06-03T15:11:08Z,0,False negatives should be reduced as the company would want to make sure that all customers that might be spending the money definitely get the coupon. Features that might be considered: 1. Prices for the products that were purchased by the customer previously.     This could give insight into the general spendings of the customer. 2. User product lookups.     What products did the user look up in the past... recommending similar products or   extensions to the same can be useful. Customers like coupon because it feels geared to them specfically. 3. Customer loyalty to the brands.     If the customer buys a lot of stuff from a certain brand. Giving the customer coupons for that brand might be useful. 4. Timing of past purchases.     A customer is more prone to buying at a certain time of a month. So providing a customer a window for the coupon could help.,True
