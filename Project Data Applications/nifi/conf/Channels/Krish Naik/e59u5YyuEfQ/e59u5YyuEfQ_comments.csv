@anilbhallavi2942,2024-03-19T13:04:49Z,0,"can't we use number directly for target like 1, 2, 3 instead of one hot encoding.",True
@joeljoseph26,2023-12-21T04:57:02Z,0,"one small correction, MSE is 1/n summation (y-y^)2",True
@maheshmec1,2023-10-03T03:35:04Z,0,"Krish there is correction @15:49 you said Squared error loss as Mean Squared Error loss (when we divide with sample number then it will be MSE). You have corrected it at 27:44, thanks!",True

@rushikeshpalnitkar4019,2023-03-02T08:08:38Z,2,"@18:57 sir i think that it has been squared not only to penalize the high error but also to account for the fact that if error is not squared,then if for one record the error is positive and for other it is negative then if we add them without squaring then total error will show to be reduced,when infact it is not that way",True

@shamshersingh9680,2021-05-01T15:21:34Z,1,How squaring a loss function penalises the model. I think squaring is performed to ensure that negative values of loss function do not cancel out positive values and we get false indication that our loss function is very small.,True
