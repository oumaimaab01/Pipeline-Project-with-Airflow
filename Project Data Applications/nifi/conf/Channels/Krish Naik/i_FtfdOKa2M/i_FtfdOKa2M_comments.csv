@milanbeherazyx,2023-09-11T17:27:19Z,2,"Hi Krish,  I was thinking, could we create a project using BentoML, Langchain, and Falcon180b or 40b or 7b? Something like a voice chat bot. We could train it on a substantial amount of data and then use it to generate responses. For instance, we could ask it to create a pair plot or a bar chart, and it would generate and display it for us. This could be a fascinating end-to-end project.  What do you think about this idea?",True
