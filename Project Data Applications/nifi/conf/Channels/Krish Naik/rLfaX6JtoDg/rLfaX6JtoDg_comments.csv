@OMPRAKASH-uz8jw,2023-09-18T12:04:59Z,8,"In Fact what I want to say is Data science , Data Engineering etc, which are related to coding, it needs the fundamental of computer science . Simply knowing how to code will not make us what we want to become. If we turn back and see, a new language called Mojo, is already there and to understand mojo, it requires the skills from C, C++, RUST and Python. In fact it requires the skills from computer science. We most of us are making mistakes like we simply learn python, solve some problems and Determine ourselves as Datascientist. What if Mojo takes everything tomorrow? since it is still and development and I am very much shocked with its Rapid development. So funda is needed everywhere or in other words, computer science is must or in simple words , bits and bytes( 0s and 1s) is must.",True
