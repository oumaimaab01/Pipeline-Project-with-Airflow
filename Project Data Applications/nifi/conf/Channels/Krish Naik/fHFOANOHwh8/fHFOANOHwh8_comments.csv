@Agros92,2022-06-06T04:41:35Z,3,"Thanks Krish, you are the best!. A question related to the ""second session"" about the Product_Category_(1,2,3), I understand that you explain that in case of NaN values in categorical feature you can use the Mode to replace the NaN values. But for this particular case I think that  is important to understand the data before doing that, since Product_Category_(1,2,3) indicated that the products can be part of multiples categories. For example a movie being categorized as ""Drama, Action, Suspense"". So for this case maybe it would be better  to try to use dummies for Product_Category_(1,2,3) and then try to sum it, it would be complex to implement it but you would get the real information about your data, since you can get the info about Product_1 being a (0,1,0,0,1,0,1) if that product has 3 categories.
