@ishuman,2023-12-12T12:27:39Z,6,"04:08:29  The Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. The Gini impurity can be computed by summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category.  In the case of the Iris dataset, the root node contains all the instances, and if they are evenly distributed among the three classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica), the Gini impurity will be 0.667. This is because the probability of choosing an instance from any class is 1/3, and the probability of misclassifying it is 2/3 (since there are two other classes). The calculation is as follows:  Gini Impurity = 1 - (1/3)^2 - (1/3)^2 - (1/3)^2 = 0.667  This indicates that there is a 66.7% chance of misclassifying a randomly chosen element from the dataset if it was labeled according to the distribution of labels in the entire dataset.  The code you provided is plotting the decision tree. The Gini impurity for each node is calculated during the creation of the decision tree, not during the plotting. The Gini impurity is shown on the plot for each node.",True

Please let me know if I am wrong. I have a query in the adjusted R square performance metric, explained around 1 hour into the video. According to the formula, When we substitute p=2, the value of adjusted Rsquare should be the same as that of Rsquare, right?

@TreBlass,2023-08-16T05:06:35Z,4,"I have a question around 1:25:40. You mentioned that we use Lasso to avoid less important features. The lower the slope, the lower is the modulus of that slope (or theta).  If I consider the mathematical definition,  in L2 Regularization: Cost is is J(theta) + lambda (sum of squares of thetas) and in L1 Regularization: Cost is is J(theta) + lambda (sum of modulus of thetas) So, if the absolute value of the slope is less than one, the square of it would be lesser, and hence we would be able to discard that feature more prominently.  Eg., (0.5)^2 = 0.25 < |0.5|    Correct me if my understanding is wrong. Thanks",True

This video is very helpful and lots of fun to watch and it’s amazing that within such a short span of time you’ve completed sort of a bridge course on ML. Kudos to you 👏🏻! However, I had a doubt that I would like to raise here. You mentioned in your video that Lasso Regularisation helps feature selection. If the theta or slope values are negligible, say close to zeros, then squaring them wouldn’t increase the values but decrease further right? Why can’t we do feature selection using ridge regularisation then? But for slopes greater than 1 this would make sense, however, in those cases we would not be able to neglect those right?",True
