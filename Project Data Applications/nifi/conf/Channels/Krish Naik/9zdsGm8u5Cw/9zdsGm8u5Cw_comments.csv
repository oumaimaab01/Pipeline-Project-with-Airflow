@behrambayramli6545,2021-07-05T22:05:58Z,5,"Writing code is not only solving a problem, but also self-study and investment in yourself. In the process of writing code, you learn and develop. Even if you google, you still compare the possible options, check the solution for optimality. You not only read different code, but also get acquainted with the arguments in favor of this or that decision.  Robots of this kind simply deprive you of this important part of your work, and you gradually (even if not overnight) lose your qualifications.  It's like instead of solving a problem, you are looking for answers in a solver. Well, yes, you solve the problem. But for yourself, you do not extract anything from this process.  I especially don't understand the argument that this frees people from reading the documentation. It may be liberating, but in many ways it leads to writing code that you don't fully understand. Who needs such a code?  Of course, technological progress, everything ... But for me, such decisions are a disservice, especially for beginners.",True
