Example : giving an apple to you first and then the drawing of an apple made by  a 10 year old kid and then you say, this looks like an apple    Reinforcement learning : learning by experimenting. Here also we don't have facility of labels to give exact corrective feedback but what we have is a reward system  is a weaker concept of label, an evaluative feedback  . Example : eat this apple to live",True

T-Test can be applied on a categorical feature which has only 2 distinct categories and when sample size is < 30 3. Z-Test is same as T-Test but is applied when sample size > 30  4. ANOVA Test is applied to categorical feature which has more than 2 distinct categories  5. T-test, Z-Test & ANOVA tests are applied only when target has continuous values . I.e, when we are working on regression model  6. Pierson Co-relation Co-eff can be applied only on numerical features. It can be applied between a feature & target and also between features  If we find 2 features that are not co-related, we can remove one of them.  7. Co-relation matrix can be applied only on numerical features 8. Chi sqr test can be applied only on categorical features",True
