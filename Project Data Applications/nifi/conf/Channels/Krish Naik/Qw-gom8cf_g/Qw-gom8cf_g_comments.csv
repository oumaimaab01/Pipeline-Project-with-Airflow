@BiancaAguglia,2020-05-05T18:06:03Z,12,"These are definitely difficult, overwhelming times, and I think the way to deal with them involves several steps:     1. be flexible about the kind of work you are willing to do.  It's better to have a job that's below your skill level than to have no job at all.     2. look for problems you can solve (and there are way too many right now) and figure out ways to solve them even if you do it for free.     3. stay informed about what's going on but don't listen to negative news for too long. There are plenty of good stories that can inspire and motivate you.   Yesterday I watched a video from Peter Diamandis called ""The Future of Positive Data-Driven News | FutureLoop"". I don't always agree with what Peter says, but I really liked the main message of that video: if you only listen to negative news you'll be in a fearful, stressed out mindset. Instead, look for the good stories: they'll give you new ideas and new hope.   Also, there's an interview with Marvin Minsky (I can't remember which interview though üôÉ) in which he talks about one of the things that makes the human brain so special: whenever it gets stuck because one of its subsystems, it figures out different ways to solve a problem. That's one way of explaining why, in a crisis, we come up with new ideas: the old solutions don't work anymore, so we're coming up with new ones.   So, even though these are difficult times and I worry about how many people can no longer afford food let alone anything extra, I hope we'll all keep being kind, help out as much as we can, and find solutions even if they don't directly benefit us. ‚ù§Ô∏è",True
