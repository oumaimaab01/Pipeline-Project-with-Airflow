@vahiagyat,2021-07-01T17:01:58Z,10,"People may jump at me but I have two major concerns/queries with this app.  The first thing I am wondering is more on the business side of it  -  there are many use cases of AI where the privacy concerns are so high that it never comes to market. In this case when I am writing a code that means it's being read by some AI model (though GitHub has given a Lil bit of confusing statement denying it). I am not sure how many companies will be okay to share their codes with a third party!!! I know people will say we already have repos in git and all but still this is a bit different.  Second thing - Honestly, I am not a fan of this kind of app being used by college students. Don't mistake me, I am very much in support of tech n growth and all new things - it will have pros and cons, I do get it.  But I feel this is handy for people in the job - where the main task is to solve the business case not to show your expertise in programming. So, there it saves time - I have logic to solve the use case but instead of writing codes for merging array or sorting (just an example), I can use this.   But for a college student, it's important to write code on their own obviously after understanding it. We have seen many people just mugging up the code and writing in exams and when a single variable is missed or one bracket is misplaced the code fails and they can't fix it because they had just mugged up the code. In this scenario, if a student uses this then I am not sure how he/she will do in a lab exam. I am okay, if a student understands all the codes coming in automatically then uses it but we all know what will happen. The whole practice of writing code is to build up your logical skills - that's why when I take interviews of any freshers or for that matter anyone, I focus more on the pseudo-code and system design, not the actual code. Yes, obviously a minimum level of knowledge is required for the language too.",True
