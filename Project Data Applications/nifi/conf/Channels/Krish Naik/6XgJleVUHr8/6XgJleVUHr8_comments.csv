@avinashbagul9848,2021-04-06T00:36:45Z,0,"There is no need for machine learning in this case... Use case is simple and can easily be approached by statistical means like finding seasonality in the data month wise (since that's our goal). We have data for ten years as explained; why not just look for the production patterns and predict new ones. Since you are looking for climate rainfall etc., for the future, then it's again predicted values and cannot be considered accurate to predict new values... Applying clustering and multiple regression models is just a waste of computational power. (Commenters: Do not say it's not a prediction problem... Bcz it is[what were you doing with the regression]). It would be best if you showed your smart brain in interviews, not complicate it...  Thank you",True

@shikhaujjainia8591,2020-06-12T18:57:42Z,1,"Very informative video. I am also working on the same use case but for 5 crops. In that, I have to suggest crop name with its production based on climatic conditions. I want to know how many algorithms then I will use for 5 crops? and by custom ensemble algorithms you mean any clustering algorithm+the algorithm that is used for label1/label2 etc, or any two algorithms like Random forest+Decision tree? and please explain how we will merge them?",True
@jt007rai,2020-05-10T08:59:47Z,1,"I have a counter argument..practically speaking, there is a cost involved in procurement and dynamic pricing is also involved..  Predicting production is one case, but uber level goal is optimising supply chain and generating maximum profit.. isn't predicting the demand from individual markets and then getting the optimal price using linear programming a better solution?",True
