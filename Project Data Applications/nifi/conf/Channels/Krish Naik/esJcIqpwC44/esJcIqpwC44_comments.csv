@rameshg.,2021-12-17T09:09:01Z,0,One question.  Is it possible to get code complition feature in any cloud notebook.,True
@rameshg.,2021-12-17T09:01:58Z,2,"It is impossible to do training, if you are pulling and pushing data directly from google drive. The reason is that the number of read and write operation is fixed. I tried to do this on dog cat classification problem. And it was impossible because the number of images is large and you do not have that many read and write operations allowed. So you have no option other than loading the data in the disk. Even if you want to upload data in the disk it will be impossible for someone who do not have a good broadband connection. Another question is what if your data set is larger than 15 GB?",True

@TheBarinco,2021-08-16T16:46:34Z,1,I used Google Collab pro for grad school project. We tried implementing this spatial temporal transformer model. Couldnt even get close to the original papers parameters.  Would recommend any student to learn gcp or aws cloud so you move to more power solution if you are put in my situation,True

@suhass6628,2021-08-15T11:16:43Z,7,"One more thing to note is Colab should be only used when you are working on Deep learning models. If you need more core power for ML models like XGboost or other ensemble models, please go for more cores (you can get free limited cores in Azure). GPU support is not there for pure sklearn ML models.",True
