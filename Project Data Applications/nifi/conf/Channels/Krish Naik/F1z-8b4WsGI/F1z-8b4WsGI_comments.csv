@nupurdeshpande2889,2019-10-08T19:07:30Z,1,To be frank I may be wrong but most ML engineers cannot code and use their math skills in coding and explain their coding. Why would a company hire you if you cannot solve their proble m using ML and deep learning algos? Can you tweak their algos? Nope. Deployment is a skill that can be learnt on the job. Plus different companies have different deployment platforms. The truth is most data scientists just lack basic data science skills and keep using already available libraries.,True

@UnfoldDataScience,2019-10-05T06:58:09Z,6,"Thanks for the informative videos Krish. I really liked the part that you were insisting on model deployment. While interviewing candidates for data science roles, I have observed that this is one area they seem to have very limited exposure.   To the guys here communicating through comments, one message from my side.   Krish always talks about data science pipeline. Please try to understand importance of that. You must prepare yourself to work on all the pipelines like data extraction, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, tuning, optimization,deployment,scaling etc. So it is very much needed to have knowledge on Big data space, Linux environment ,azure services, amazon sagemaker etc at least at high level. This is again something which gives you an edge over other candidates when you mention in resume.   Thanks Aman",True
