@vahiagyat,2021-01-21T13:07:52Z,0,"Good Luck, for your future man! And I am assuming today is your birthday so happy birthday.  Krish: These videos are really good as it gives real-life examples to the people. I know still many people will say this wasn't the transition and this is was not the common story. Unfortunately, they don't understand the whole point to show this video is that you also work hard to make 'your story NOT THE COMMON STORY"".  And a good point highlighted here - you will get like max of 5-6 calls (good ones). So make it count. I have seen so many people - they are in hurry to apply so they write a whole lot of things in the resume but haven't really prepared for all those things. Yes, you get the call by writing all fancy things in your resume but definitely, in an interview, you will fail. And most of the companies have some time restriction in reapplying - so better wait for 2 more months (just an example) and give your best shot.",True
