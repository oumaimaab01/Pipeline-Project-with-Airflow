But your precision and recall are so high which is not good for this kind of analyses (because we don't want to wrongly predict a disease to be diabetic and also we don't want to miss any patient with diabetes. The precision is somewhat acceptable not low recall). Do you an intuition of how you can improve those and overall accuracy? Maybe some feature selection and feature engineering? I want to know more thoughts on it. Maybe a follow-up video on this?,True
