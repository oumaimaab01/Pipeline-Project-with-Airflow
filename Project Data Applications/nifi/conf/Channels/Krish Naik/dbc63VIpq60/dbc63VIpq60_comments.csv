@SpotYourLight,2022-08-10T14:38:33Z,0,"just one thing. that innermost loop only runs if that '""if"" conditional gets triggered. Now from j = i to j=i*i-1 that ""if"" gets true only if we find a factor of i, right? So that last ""k-loop"" will not run in order of i^2 even in worst case as the  no. of factors of i^2 is much less than i^2",True

@jyothinkjayan6508,2021-01-04T15:35:33Z,14,"Hi sir I have a doubt on inner for loop ,does  it runs n**2 times or it is n times . ALSO since there is a if j%i==0 condition it reduces the THEN added time complexity drastically(which was supposed to be added from last for loop)  so in total it can't reach O(n**4) but it will be above O(n**3) I executed the code in this way  def fn(n):     count1=0     count2=0     count3=0     for i in range(n):         count1+=1         j=i         while j<i*i:             count2+=1             j=j+1             if j%i==0:                 for k in range(0,j):                     count3+=1     return count1,count2,count3 fn(400)                 I executed this code for n =10,100,200,400 The tuples returned are added up to check how much it reaches. it never reached n**4   print(10+240+1110)   # n=10 print(10**4) >> 1360 10000  print(100+323400+12410475)   #n=100 print(100**4) >> 12733975 100000000  print(200+2626800+199308450)   #n=200 print(200**4) >> 201935450 1600000000  print(400+21173600+3194566900)    #n=400 print(400**4) >> 3215740900 25600000000",True
