@trajan9557,2022-05-08T18:06:41Z,0,Thank you Krish..Got some idea to opt for Python,True
@AlokPratapSingh4001,2022-01-30T21:27:39Z,2,"R is essential for data science. R is for research, and P (python) is for production.",True
@nybre8964,2021-11-14T22:16:53Z,2,To be fair these days R and Python pretty much can do the same things for data science (atleast the basics which get the work done)…. Just that majority of people use python in industry (depends on industry)…. So you won’t go wrong with either. Just learn both actually,True
@manishvaity5492,2021-07-15T06:45:53Z,1,"Sir, I have done Java Programming earlier. While learning R Programming, will it help?",True
@adityamathur2284,2021-05-25T16:19:52Z,1,"R has Web Application Framework:  Shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/  Also R is amazing with SQL , and integration with Cloud is also there. We can write Web Applications using both R and Python in R using reticulate library.. I haven't done much work in Deep learning but R has support both for Keras and Tensorflow 2.0. Even Big Data analysis is better with R due to Lazy Evaluation. Visualization libraries are great too.  both are open source languages and we should not only learn both but also contribute to enhance their features.",True

@LeftThumbBreak,2020-10-29T14:37:57Z,0,"If your primary goal is to be an engineer or developer with ML, DL, as your key skill, you basically must know Python.  It's not really an option.   However if you're in a science field or other statistics heavy area and need to apply analytics and/or ML with your domain knowledge, I feel R can be more productive to use.   Realistically, you should know both and let your tasks and objective carry you in whichever direction.  Basically if you're dealing with known established methods and mainly with scientific and tabular data, I feel R is easier to understand and more efficient from a code writing standpoint.  There are a ridiculous amount of stats packages and they can have very specific tasks and domains  which help you from having to build everything from the ground up. For sure the packages also are much better vetted than Python libraries.  Examples are typically well written and I feel the community is tighter.  On the other hand R will always lag behind Python on basically any new methods.  If you intend to work with any cutting edge subjects, be that reinforcement learning, BERT or things like FastAI, these will be in Python and may never get to R.  A big advantage as Krish noted is you can code in a full stack with Python.  If you want you can build your front end, your app all in Python.  Beyond Shiny, even if there is a GUI for R, it's really an afterthought with R, while Python has very active and progressing GUI frameworks.  So even if you spend most of your time in R, it's good thing to know Python to round you out if your goal is to be a developer.  The other question maybe is, Julia vs Swift.",True
@abhishekranjan4009,2020-09-06T22:21:11Z,1,"Yes, Python is the best Programming language.  I love Python......",True
@DaarShnik,2020-07-04T12:24:11Z,11,R is equally good for data sciences roles too. Especially when most of the time you have to write a custom algorithm and predefined algorithms just don't work. And now you can even build webpages and dashboards in R. So it's a bias to say Python is better.  If you have started your career from c++ and java you will love Python and if you have excel or sas background you will love R. Everything else is just an opinion,True
@mukundajmera8228,2020-06-06T18:42:26Z,2,"Nice video, one thing I want to say There is multiple ways even R can be integrated with multiples languages.",True
@datasciencewithraghav,2020-06-03T02:22:03Z,12,I like your analysis of R vs Python. However in my projects I have seen very senior data scientists prefer R for creating statistical models. This is especially true for time series models where some of the packages available in R are not even available in Python or worse the Python packages even give incorrect results. I work in the financial industry.  I guess one should know both R and Python to be the best data scientist,True

@wolfisraging,2020-05-31T16:03:59Z,2,"To be honest I don't think it matter that much, both are good and mature, choose any one and learn. The only true reason I can think for going to python is the web dev and the massive community support (for ml, dl....). Apart from that.....................................",True

@GelsYT,2020-05-31T15:55:44Z,4,"This is so cooool :D I have read a lot of stuffs/blogs all over the internet on which programming language to use for data science. I mean R is great, no doubt but it seems a lot of people choose python. I mean whenever I see a thing about something like classifications (NLP) , predicting stock prices something like that again I mean they always introduce it in the python programming language. Just sharing my observation :D Thank you sir Krish Naik for this video :D for us to further more know about the two languages :D",True
