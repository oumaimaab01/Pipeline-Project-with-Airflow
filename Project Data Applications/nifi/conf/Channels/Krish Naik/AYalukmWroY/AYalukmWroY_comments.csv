The procedure I used to follow is this. I always do comparing and finding missing values first and then move towards scaling.    Variable Identification; X, y => #cat, #Num Describe the data, info, head(), etc. => read the data properly, get an insight into it. Outliers feature-wise Missing values if #really large, then first fill them separately, separate them form outliers.                    else check for outliers For missing value treatment: dropna, fillna, Imputer(mean, median, mode),  predictive Modeling(will gonna get too behaved data), K-NN( k=? The dataset should not be too large).  For outliers:  Visualization - Box plot, scatter plot, hist plot Detect - Box plot; -1.5 IQR to 1.5 IQR 	  SD* - (2-3) x SD   5th to 95th %tile   Mahalanobis distance Remove the outliers - drop them, natural log, reduce the wgts, treat them separately    Entire dataset outliers Imbalance Data - final class Univariate correlation - Cat-count %age, cont curve, skewness, kurtosis Treat skewness and kurtosis Feature selection / PCA Feature correlation/bivariate correlation - if any two are the same, drop either, helps in visualization the relationship between them. Cat - Cat - cat1 table, cat2 table, table(cat1 v/s cat2), chi2 test, see if you need to treat them separately  Cont - Cont - scatter plot, correlation = cov(X,Y)/(varX VarY)^0.5  Cat-Cont - see if you can treat them separately, separate them by tables and test p-values (z-test, t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon, Friedman)  Feature engineering -  Variable transformation - either sqrt, cube root => left skewed [cubic (-, +, 0), sqrt (+,0)] or loge=>right skewed[except 0, -] Done to convert non-lin to liner relationship Can use binning Variable creation",True
