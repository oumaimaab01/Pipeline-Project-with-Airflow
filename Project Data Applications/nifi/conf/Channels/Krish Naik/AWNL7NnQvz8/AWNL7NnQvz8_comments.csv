@krishnaik06,2020-07-29T16:30:23Z,72,"Hello All, Few important point I really want to make in this interview 1. Always hear and understand the complete question that is being asked. 2. Always try to answer to the point. 3. If you do not know something, please tell the interviewer u dont know. It is ok to say u dont know instead of hitting around the bushes. 4.  Do not be rude or show attitude in front of the interviewers. They are hiring you to run  a company. Definitely with this attitude you will never be able to clear any interviews in life unless you know someone in the company personally.  Please take this feedbacks. It will definitely help you all :) Happy Learning!!",True

@rhiteshkumarsingh4401,2022-07-09T06:59:14Z,0,"Whats with this guy? If i was the interviewer i would have rejected him outright. The first thing a ds should think is whats the simplest way to get the result. If an ml model can do the trick, why go for dl? Paul has a very small bubble of thought where he just wants to implement dl without even thinking if the problem can be solved by ml or does it even require data science. Even after repeated attempts by Krish and Sudhanshu, he is not ready to listen. Damn. And Paul will forever be a worker, a slave to the company he works in. He doesnt want to innovate or go in the depth of an algo to understand the math behind it. Without using any brains he just wants to implement. And he will never fit in masters with this approach. Data science is built on maths and to ignore that is foolish. Hope he changes company and gets to face reality.",True
@vinyasshreedhar9833,2021-12-27T07:50:50Z,0,"Few points to Paul. 1. Your body language is very bad. You are most of the times swaying your chair. This shows you are not serious about the interview.  2. You never listen to the complete question. This shows you don't have patience to listen and understand the question completely. 3. Your answers are never to the point. You are only trying to beat around the bush with whatever little you know related to deep learning. 4. Since you are already working with Sudhanshu and Krish, you do not have the seriousness of an interview. Looks like you are thinking it's a discussion over a cup of coffee.   5. Some of your answers look very innocent but when you try to argue or convince it looks like you are arrogant. For example. Maths is not important. You say coding is important end of day. How will you code if you do not know the maths behind it? If I ask you to add 2 numbers, how will you know that sum function will work if you don't know what is addition? 6. With the above points adding to your communication skills, even if you do either a Masters or PhD nobody would hire you. 7. I would personally have hired a graduate student and trained him if he had the right attitude and good communication skills. 8. One more thing. You always kept saying OK at end of a sentence. It sounds like you are ordering or imposing on the interviewer. 9. It is clearly evident that you have some pre-assumptions about a lot of things which is deep rooted in your mind. This is blocking your learning. You need to come out of those deep rooted assumptions and have a open mind to learn. 10. Always note that Maths and Statistics are the basis for any ML/DL technology. Even long before computers were invented, many statisticians would perform linear regression with paper and pen. You should first learn ML thoroughly and then move to learn DL.  Hope you work on these things which will surely help you in your long term career. Please do not think its demotivation. Take it in the right spirit.",True

Secondly, Paul if you are seeing this, I would like to say that I respect your approach to handling things top-down. In my company too, I had to make sure the deliverables were on time, and I really couldn't focus much on mathematics but that doesn't mean that mathematics is not needed. I also took technical interviews in my last company and I would any day pick up a data scientist who might know only a few algorithms but is well versed with mathematics over someone who knows 30-40 algos but not how they work. I have seen people who have implemented Random Forests 100 times but still don't know what ""random"" in the random forest means. Just don't feel let down by any comments. I was just like you a few months back until I started watching Krish's videos and realized how important mathematics is. Let's just say that the overall time taken for me to decide on models has gone down so much. Just an open-ended question that might change your mentality: How do you know what will be the output size of the image from the convolutional layer if I pass a 32x32 image with everything else default?",True

@afim08,2020-07-28T22:28:00Z,4,"What a fabulous effort from Krish. I am looking forward for more contents like this.  Ps: Paul, When someone speaks, try not to interrupt. Let them talk/ask/comment, then you say. Just a suggestion.",True
@motivationshortsadda,2020-07-28T22:23:12Z,4,"I felt like this one is an experienced interview and in comparison to this virat's one was close to a fresher....On a positive side he has learnt a lot during a small stint which is very good...but even if it was a dummy interview , attitude was totally 0. Even if you have 100% knowledge but 0 respect towards interviewer you won't be selected. But, totally appreciate the efforts and time taken by everyone..",True

@MK_2205,2020-07-28T19:33:06Z,10,"Paul, this is for you! it seems you took DS for your time pass and for money earning domain till you do masters. Please dont say that you are a data scientist until you realise math is core behind it. at the EOD computer itself boolean algebra- zeros and ones. Small piece of advice , at-least please act like formal ,serious in upcoming interviews even if its a dummy. i am sure if you show this attitude in real interview you wont be selected. All the best! and don't think what ever you did is cool today because its not....",True

@ganeshrao405,2020-07-28T18:59:02Z,13,"Krish was keep on trying to help Paul him to understand his experience approach in learning things but ha ha Paul he is in his space of learning ways. It was informative interview for first 40 mins. I  always love Sudhanshu cool knowledge person and Krish just helps everyone. One thing I would say paul being fresher not taking his time to listen rather intention to ans. Listening is important skill always in any field. It helps talk ans in few words for any question. Good one overall , thanks Krish , sudhansu, Paul",True

@kaustubhgupta12,2020-07-28T18:43:24Z,13,"aftet 39:14, it didn't sounded like it's a fresher interview and rather a one on one conversation with a friend or a podcast which is absolutely fine and I actually enjoyed that both the parties are trying to prove their points but it's a request to Krish sir and Sudhanshu sir that next time please take interview of an actual fresher and not an expertise like in this case as it doesn't give a good idea that how an actual fresher will give interview. In my definition, a fresher is someone who has done some work in ML or DL in our case and now applying for internships or just graduated, typically a 3rd year or 4th year graduate. Hope this message reaches Krish sir and Sudhanshu sir😃",True

@akshaybhople4814,2020-07-28T18:15:05Z,2,Interview was worth watching. But we cannot call this an fresher interview because paul is already working in ineuron and he started the interview by describing the experiance at ineuron.,True
@deepikabharadwaj7571,2020-07-28T18:12:30Z,6,Sorry to say but this was not at all the interview. Very Very disappointed.,True
@vahiagyat,2020-07-28T18:02:39Z,16,"My 2 cents:  * Please try to make these interviews a little more formal/serious. By that, I don't mean scare the person but be close to the real-life scenario. * Sudhanshu was mentoring Paul and hence Sudhanshu had the opportunity to observe him over the period of time, that's why he was able to see his exceptional tech skills and he can see he completes the task. But in an interview, the interviewer will not have that much time. And in such scenario, if the interviewee will cut the interviewer like this on these many occasions without listening to the questions! I am not sure how much inclined an interviewee will be to hire ( no offense to anyone - just mentioning so that no one picks up this trait).    Appreciate that Krish took some serious role replay and personally, I agree with Krish regarding Maths and starting from basic at least while in the early phase of your career. I am a Tech Program and Product Manager and I have seen the situations that Krish was mentioning happening in my company. But I do understand Paul is a fresher and most likely in future he will face situations where he will understand the need for Mathematics and basics - and he is referring to  Jeremy Howard, please go through his life and work, he too built the foundation first. Everyone has his own view so it's fine just that I would prefer someone who is open for possibilities and would have answered to Krish "" yes this might be the case but I haven't faced it till now :) "".  Having said all, I appreciate the work Krish and Sudhanshu are doing. Have been following Krish for a long time and recently started following Sudhanshu/iNeuron (have joined DL CV/NLP course too).",True

@sarikakeshri2157,2020-07-28T17:07:01Z,24,"After watching this interview I want to say something.  Maybe I don't have much knowledge in the area in which you are working and vice versa but if you are going for an interview as an Interviewee... Again as an interviewee... Then you have to follow some protocols ... Actually, these are the etiquettes of an interview. 1.  You are going for an interview .. you are going to show your knowledge that you have..  it is totally fine that you do not know about some techniques or something or you don't get a chance to work on it ... But when the interviewer asks you about those things those techniques you didn't work previously or you didn't come across.. say him ...sir I didn't work on it or I don't know about it instead of saying that this technique will not be required based on the techniques you know and without having proper knowledge of the technique interviewer asks you...  2. The second thing is that Don't say mathematics is not needed even though you didn't face situations dealing with mathematics but some or other day you have to deal with it and accept it ... Every domain needs mathematical concepts for solving their problems. Each and everything is revolving around mathematics... Mathematics is the backbone of all the algorithms. Mathematics is the one which gives a solution to the problem .. language or libraries are only the way of implementing those solutions. How can you say that this algorithm works better than others if you don't know the mathematics behind it... if you don't know the problem-solving approach of algorithm which is again given by the mathematical concepts or you just say it performs better by seeing the time taken by algorithms? But see, time taken by the algorithm again comes from the mathematical approach used in it ... So ultimately you are dealing with mathematical concepts all the time... 3. Listen properly before jumping on the answers.. it sometimes looks that you just prepared for the answers while picking words from the questions. 4. And last but not least ..  Respect interviewer .. if you carry an attitude of answering a question that is against the above mentioned three points... It sometimes looks that you are disrespecting interviewer and you intensionally make him feel bad. it's not about him only but it's not good for you .. you are going there to get the job opportunity.. not defending those that you know and don't give importance to those which you don't know.  ... Be humble.. and accept that you don't know all the things even you cannot know all but maybe the things you don't know would work better ..... And finally... Not all the days are yours... Unintentionally you behave like this because of nervousness or overconfidence or something else... Sorry for this long comment...",True
