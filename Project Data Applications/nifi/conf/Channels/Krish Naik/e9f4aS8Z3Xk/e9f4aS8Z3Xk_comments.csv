@tobewanad,2024-01-24T06:36:11Z,4,"Hey Krish, thanks for all of the info and confidence boost!  Related to needing ML & DL to understand GenAI and its use cases better, I needed to brush up on the statistics and math to understand ML & DL algorithms. Following codebasics and your channel I could easily classify and cluster, but I regress... I didn't grasp the underlying concepts which were applicable beyond specific algorithms, and the steps were almost arbitrary. After some YouTube, For Dummies books, and talking to ChatGPT it's all coming together.   Anyways, just want to share a bit of my journey and wish you and all other aspirants the best!",True
