@amiralioghli8622,2023-11-18T08:40:17Z,2,"Hi sir, thank you for sharing your valuable information with us.  I have a suggestion. My comment does not pertain to the content of the current video since you've uploaded new content. Therefore, I am writing it here for you to read.  I recently completed all your tutorials on time series data, both univariate and multivariate. From what I gathered in your tutorials, your primary focus lies in sequential data specially NLP. Hence, I'd like to request, if possible, Please make a series on implementing Transformers in time series data. This could cover classification, forecasting, or anomaly detection—just one of these aspects would be sufficient for educational purposes. I'm interested in understanding the methodology you propose in dealing with this.  Currently, Transformers are extensively used in sequential data and image segmentation. Surprisingly, there's a scarcity of tutorials available on YouTube that delve into employing Transformers specifically for time series data.",True

I really wanted to make chatbot with existing documentation of my tech stack. This seems to be much more promising. Now that, I gotta scrap all data from web as text and feed to gpt builder and call it a day where I got ChatGPT that refers to up-to-date data and is not limited to pre-existing training data.",True
