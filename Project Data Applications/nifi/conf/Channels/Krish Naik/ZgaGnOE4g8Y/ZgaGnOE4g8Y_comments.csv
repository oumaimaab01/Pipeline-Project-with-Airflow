@chinmayameher7316,2020-04-01T08:30:51Z,0,Krish sir. Looking at current situation i think of building a chatboot using oriya language related to Corona virus symptoms and precautions. Apollo hospital has also build one but i think to build in oriya.   I actually thought this after seeing your video on chatbot. 1-will it be possible to create and maintain within 3-5 days. As i also need one doctor friend to check the data. I have friends who are currently doctors. 2- will building through Microsoft will be good or Google. 3- will you course on this channel provide introductory lesson to start. 4- i am genuinely asking sir. It will satisfy me if i did this now.  Thanks in advance.  Link to apollo  https://covid.apollo247.com/,True
