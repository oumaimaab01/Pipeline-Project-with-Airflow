@cando_jo,2023-04-26T22:39:06Z,1,Don't waste your time and write the code. This won't work. He obviously did not try other faces because he knew it would not work as well!  Waste of time!,True

@louerleseigneur4532,2021-07-23T22:56:41Z,0,Thanks Krish,True
@shachoud,2021-07-10T14:17:06Z,5,This method of face recognition doesn't work on facial features rather on the image layout. This is more likely image classification or object classification rather than face recognition. In your example it works because your trained data and image capture via webcam is same. If you try any of your other image where your face little far...it won't recognize you!,True
