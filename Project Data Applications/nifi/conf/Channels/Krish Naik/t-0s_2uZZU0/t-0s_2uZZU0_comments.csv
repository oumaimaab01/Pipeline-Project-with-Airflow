@rebhuroy3713,2024-05-12T15:10:03Z,0,"Hi Krish, i Have seen entire video. i am confused with 2terms. some times you said its possible to train with my own data (own data refers from a url , pdfs , simple text etc) but when you are trying to train the llm model you are giving inputs as in certain format like### question : ans.   Now if i want to train my llm in real life scenario i don't have my data in this instruction format right in that case what to do. And its not possible to transform my raw text to into that format right how to handle that situation . is it a only way to fine tune in specific format or i can train given in raw text format i know a process where i need to convert my text to chunks then pass to llm. those are really confusing can you clear those things",True
