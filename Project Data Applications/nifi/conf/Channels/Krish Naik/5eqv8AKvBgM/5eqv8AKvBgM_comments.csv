@ArshadAnsari37,2023-02-27T08:30:13Z,4,"LLM are not databases. It just gets trained on information that it uses to form knowledge model. So, what it says, should be considered factually wrong but semantically correct. However, the model is so good that is also factually correct many times. So we started relying on it for facts too, which should not be done in the first place.  The factual correctness of the LLM is a side effect, not the main objective.",True
