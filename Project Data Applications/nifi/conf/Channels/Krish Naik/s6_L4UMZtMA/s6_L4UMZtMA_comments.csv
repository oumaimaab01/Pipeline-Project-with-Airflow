We have been able to land some good projects, however, we now want to up our game and expand, so we are exploring ways to bring in more projects, preferably bigger and long-term.   Can you advise what platforms/avenues/channels should we explore to get more leads and clients?  Cheers!",True

Students (mostly in developing countries) can't afford reasonable prices for courses, they also don't turn up to the calls, don't have credit cards or good internet connections.  I'm going through a pivot.  Currently planning to do lots of marketing to and sales with companies who can afford good Data Scientists, pay reasonable rates.  I'll do the work they need. I've been doing a course on starting a consulting business, so I'm not a complete newbie.  Think I'll also do competitions.",True

Once done with your project, write an article with captivating visualizations and sell your article to cricket websites, blogs, or papers. If you do a good job, it will lead to repeat work. üòä",True
