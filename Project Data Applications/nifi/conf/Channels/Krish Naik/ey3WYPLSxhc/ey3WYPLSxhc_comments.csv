@harshit6623,2021-02-25T06:20:11Z,0,It's a very good initiative from your side and your team. I have always appreciated this!! The only thing which slightly disappoints me is that you announce it all of a sudden!! It's not easy in my case to attend because of my prior commitments. And tableau is highly important to me.  Yes I'll be critical here and I'll also be criticized by others but I can't help it!! Hopefully you'll post the recorded session for the same!! Thx as always!! Regards,True
