@gitadanesh7496,2020-08-11T01:32:09Z,7,Hi Krish. Thank you very much for your videos. I just have questions regarding the reasons you mentioned why we cannot use linear regression for classification. 1) outliers : in general outliers make the model inaccurate and we should fix or remove them. 2) what if y>1 or y<0: we said everything greater than 0.5 is assumed obese and less than 0.5 is not obese so this definition covers y> 1 and  and y<0,True
