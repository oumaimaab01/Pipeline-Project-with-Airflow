@StevenSmith68828,2022-09-12T06:01:34Z,0,This is going to sound dumb but in a 2x2 how would a 1d max pooling work with size 1 would that just return the same thing or the highest number I have been searching and have not found a good answer,True
@RanjitSingh-rq1qx,2022-09-05T11:51:43Z,0,Sir if we apply the padding equal to 1 then we will get 4*4 metric output. Not a 3*3 metric output. I learnt this thing in your previous video. But u r saying now it will return 3*3 metric. how is it possible sir ?,True

@EssDubz,2021-07-03T18:30:19Z,1,"In no existing framework anyway does max pooling round up the output dimension size. If stride takes you off the edge, you don't include it. The output dimension for a 3x3 image, with a kernel  size of 2, and stride of 2, is 1x1",True
@badiyabhargav8597,2021-07-03T13:33:54Z,0,"Sir,  Can any one plz clarify my doubt that  do we apply activation for max pooling ? or  we apply activation fun  before pooling method ?",True

@MrAyandebnath,2021-05-10T12:48:30Z,0,"@krish Naik...You are aweosme and a great teacher. But you explained max pooling wrong. The example you used provided 4 as max value for the last quadrant you used, it should be 8 not 4. The concept of max pooling doesn't use stride 2. The concept is well written in https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53 I am not criticizin Krish, just wanted to let you know the right method.",True
@mukund198526,2021-04-25T04:28:51Z,6,"Really so simply explained and now see the difference how a upgrad professor explained the same concept -   Max pooling: If any one of the patches says something strongly about the presence of a certain feature, then the pooling layer counts that feature as 'detected'. Average pooling: If one patch says something very firmly but the other ones disagree,  the pooling layer takes the average to find out.",True

@AbhaySingh-fp6ew,2021-03-29T11:40:28Z,1,"At 5:50, are you saying that max pooling layer is also learned during the training process? if so, then that seems wrong",True

@rithwikchhugani8117,2020-12-09T00:12:19Z,2,"Hi krish. I am confused about one thing. Once we have applied the filter on the image, does it pass through the activation function and then go to the maxpooling layer or the activation function is applied twice ?",True
@vermaanky11,2020-11-30T04:40:52Z,3,"As per your previous video, you informed that if padding layer is added then the formula is n-2p-f+1. Hence if we apply the same here with P=1, then we should get 1X1 matrix rather than 3X3. Correct me if I am wrong.",True
@aakankshajaiswal1809,2020-10-15T08:11:32Z,0,"I think that the filter dimension is a hyperparameter that is fixed and cannot be updated during backpropagation. Still not sure, correct me if I'm wrong.",True
