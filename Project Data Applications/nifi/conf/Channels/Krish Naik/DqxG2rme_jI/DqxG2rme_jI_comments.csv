@starultra2863,2021-11-24T18:31:42Z,11,I wouldn't recommend this book because it doesn't cover mathematics behind Machine learning algorithm and concept and relies heavily on libraries. So beginners often mistake using libraries as understanding machine learning. Understanding Mathematics behind ML seperates 10th grade boy using ML libraries and a Data Science professional. I would recommend Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow which has maths explained behind ML concepts.,True
