@prajjwalsingh5884,2022-01-03T03:02:04Z,0,Instagram is already doing enough psycological damage to people. Metavese is more immersive and people would forget the boundaries between real and virtual. I know there are going to be precautionary measures but still I am highly skeptical about it. And the image of facebook add some weight to this skepticism.  Also with AR I believe the pornographic industry would just shoot up. It would definitely distort the social structure of how people see relationships and all. Conclusion: People would become more METArialistic!   P.S. I am not saying that technological innovations should be prohibited but I am more concerned with there purpose. And I think it has more to do with profit.,True
