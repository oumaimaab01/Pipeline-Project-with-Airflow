I have worked on some of the skills required for data analysis like - Python, SQL, PowerBI, Excel, and now I am actively looking for a data analyst role.  While applying to analytics post I came across some Questions like:  1) Do you have knowledge of data piplelining and extraction using SQL? => Sincec, I prepared for data analyst on youtube. where I learn how to extract data using SQL but did not get to learn how to create the Pipeline.   so can you make video to show real work on how to create Pipelines.  2) Do you have analyzing and interpreting data with Redshift, Oracle, NoSQL experience? => some videos on Redshift. I know you have made videos on NoSQL and Oracle. but here my request is, Make some videos where we can get to see how Real work happens in Organization related to Azure , AWS Redshift, How Data is collected from Databases using SQL.  basically  I want to learn ETL.  Hope you understand my request, and I believe that this will be the most requested thing from lot of users.
