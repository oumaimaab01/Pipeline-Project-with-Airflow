@BiancaAguglia,2020-01-11T07:17:27Z,16,"I started looking at the Think Stats book and I don't know if it's such a good choice for a beginner. The idea of the book is good and I like that it goes through practical examples, but I don't understand why the author created his own modules with classes and methods that are already available in pandas, matplotlib, etc (the hist method for example).   That can make things confusing for someone new to Python and data science. Plus, it's also probably not the best use of a beginner's time: they already have so much to learn, their time would be better spent learning a library like pandas, numpy, etc. instead of a very limited use module like thinkstats2.    Maybe the author can write a version of the book based exclusively on data structures, classes, and methods from Python's standard library and from libraries widely used in the data science community. In my opinion, that would make the book more useful. üòä",True
