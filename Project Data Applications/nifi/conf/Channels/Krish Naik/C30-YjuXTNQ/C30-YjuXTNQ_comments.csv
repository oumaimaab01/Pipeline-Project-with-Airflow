@reggin9950,2021-11-25T20:19:46Z,2,Omg I can't even think of a better time to get this video on my timeline. So here is my experience - i work as an inside sales executive in the SAAS field and cracked a job as a Java developer in an MNC but the company declared my candidature as null and void since I was not able to get green exit from my current employer due to 90 days notice period. I was so demotivated but seeing this video has given me the idea how to proceed further. PS - my current employer retained and hopefully I might also get an appraisal.üôÇ,True

@pravatmohanty1052,2021-11-14T13:20:52Z,0,"Dear Krish, your topic is quite good one. This notice period issue is a troublesome for many aspirants, they resigned and do not complete the notice period with their employer. The end result they don't have relive order & experience certificate as well problem with last working date and receive legal notice. Being a HR, I would like to request all the job aspirants do not; 1.  take wrong decision of leaving jobs prior to get one. 2. Fulfill the clauses of your appointment 3. Make graceful exit to have Hassel free carrier 4. Do not fall into trap of HR on verbal assurance 5. Do not accept any such job that does not respect your notice period 6. Always use written communication avoid verbal communication",True

@girishksahu,2021-11-09T04:16:15Z,2,"This appears to be an example of Low Bias (Multiple Job Offer) and High Variance (90 Day Notice Period) üòÇ  And this employee (data point) seems to be an outlier with being very critical resource in current organization, bagged multiple job offers and also reasonably very good hike (may be currently underpaid).  But I agree with strategy on handling 90 Day Notice period which totally depends on individual readiness (Well prepared resume, Well prepared for interview, Getting interview calls, Pipeline of interviews and Potential offers in pipeline etc.).  And option of With Resignation should be considered once you have explored all possible way to stay with your current organization whether it is related to salary, career growth or lateral move.",True
