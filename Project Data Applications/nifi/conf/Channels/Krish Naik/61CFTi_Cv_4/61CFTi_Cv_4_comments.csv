With interest of learning data science, pursuing MTech Data science in BITS Wilp 2 years program.   I am religiously following your youtube videos for my learnings more than BITS lectures.

I have another 1 year to complete my course.   I feel down sometimes, asking myself whether am i going in right track of my career or not. I fear about without having better knowledge on mathematics skills will be able get better job in data science/ML engineer jobs in future.
