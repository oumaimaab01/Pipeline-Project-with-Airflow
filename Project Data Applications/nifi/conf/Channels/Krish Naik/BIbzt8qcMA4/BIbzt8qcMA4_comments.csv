@ridhimjain8170,2022-09-06T12:56:28Z,0,"False Negative is much more ump for stock market, cause here if we predict that the market won't crash but actually it does, will lead to a huge loss.  For False positive, there might only be a loss of profits but losses aren't present at the magnitudes of the above case.",True
@CostaBoss98,2022-04-23T16:21:29Z,0,"doesn't it all depend on what the hypothesis is? If you invert the hypothesis, a false negative becomes a false positive, and you can play with that. Also it depends on the actions you take from the insight you receive. If the hypothesis is 'the stock market will fall', and as a consequence you enter a lot of short positions... a false positive is pretty damaging; but if instead you just hedge some of the long positions you have, adding some options, or whatever... than it is not so damaging. So in general terms, asking when a false positive is more important than a false negative, shows a complete misunderstanding of type I and type II error: you should not work for a company that asks you something like this.",True

@maheshmec1,2021-06-22T03:19:54Z,0,"False positive is not important for stock market, as it will create panic in market (people start selling shares in fear of loss & these will again crash stock a lot). Here false negative is important than False positive (if market is crashing anyway this will save from panic situation).",True
@harisjoseph117,2021-04-17T04:13:28Z,0,"Crashing of stock market, False negetive is also important because,  even though it is going to crash when you predict as 'not going to crash' people will not withdraw money but will loose money when eventually it crashes.",True
@harisjoseph117,2021-04-17T04:11:07Z,0,"Crashing of stock market, False positive is important because,  even though it does not really going to crash when you predict as 'going to crash' people will not invest money, or withdraw money.",True
@Vishal-rj6bn,2020-12-07T07:25:56Z,4,"Taking, 0 - for Market won't crash 1 - for Market will crash  Then, if False Negatives are higher, it means model have higher chances of not predicting the market crash and hence this will lead to great loss to investors.  Onthe other hand, if False positives higher then it will predict that market will crash when it will not and hence this will lead to loss of opportunity to trade with some potential stock.",True

@MrTapan1994,2020-09-02T10:35:15Z,1,"As per me. if I will put in simple words... that will be FP-> Falsely said positive..  if we are talking about where risk is the wrt being positive then FP should be more important. the example Did a student cheat on his exam ???  If positive(means if model says the student cheats, then this is a risker move by model, Might student career may spoil with this decision). and vice-versa. Let me know if this answer is correct.",True
@anujvyas9493,2020-06-12T11:46:48Z,2,Stock Market Prediction is an example of False Positive... because FP means actual value is negative (stock market going down) but predicted value is positive (stock market going up).,True

@chhavimunna86,2020-05-23T16:31:28Z,21,"1. Model accuracy is not of great importance in imbalanced datasets. In those cases, we look at other performance metrics like sensitivity, specificity , f1-score etc. 2. Spam detection, stock market crash are examples where false positives are important. Reason being, its more problematic when model says your email is a spam but in reality its not. So you will miss out on an imp one. Also, stock market crash, where the model predicted that the market is not gonna crash, investor invests in loads of money but it actually crashes and then the investor looses all of the money invested. False negative in stock market crash is a lost opportunity. 3. Examples where False negative is important are healthcare and risk compliance/sanction models. When model says the person doesn't have cancer, but in reality the person has cancer. So the person will miss out on imp medications. Also, risk models like customer risk ranking model, where the model predicts the customer to be non-risky but actually the customer is risky. And the consequence being, the bank allows such customers to do business with them and end up in a mess where they perform suspicious activity like money laundering. Thank you Krish.

While in case of shopping mall theft detection system, False negative is more important i.e recall should be good.",True
@nithinkhydrose4899,2020-03-22T10:16:19Z,1,"For a company wanting to know which of their employees will leave, false positive is riskier than false negative.  An employee leaving unexpectedly will have company scrambling to find a suitable replacement but an employee with the positive risk of leaving staying on is considered a good thing in most situations. In that case, model performance trumps model accuracy. Model accuracy is for cases where false positive and false negative have equal importance. Recommendation engine prefer model accuracy.",True
@pratikraut7426,2020-03-22T07:02:38Z,5,"False negatives are more important in healthcare field, I think.  if a model predicts negative but the person really has that disease then this would be dangerous.   False positives are more important where loss is more important the gain. In case of stock market as you said, if a model tells you to take shares of any company and predicts to have a good return but it won't.",True
@dragonhead48,2020-03-22T03:57:37Z,0,"Model accuracy versus model performance is very much problem dependant.  If your model is being used in the defense industry, for example, you have a model that is predicting a friend from foe,  you want that performance of the model to be close to 100%  This could be the difference between life or death for a fighter pilot for example.  Model accuracy in the lab is far less important.  If you have a model predicting the numbers of a zip code ( think MNIST)  accuracy is more important.

@xixiongguo2986,2020-03-21T14:42:55Z,2,"FP > FN: Spam email detection.  As classifier assumes it as Spam and moved to trash, while it is not spam, then the user may misses the email and may causes a lot of trouble. While if it is spam but classifier failed to detect, then user will see the spam then it is not a big deal, user will delete it by one click.   FN > FP: Disease detection. If someone is infected, but classifier failed to detect, then this people will go outside and affect the surrounding people and community.   FN = FP .  Maybe stock market risk?

@chaitanyamallepudi3531,2020-03-21T13:59:32Z,25,In case of disease prediction (ex: covid 19) False negative is riskier;because if the person has infected with disease but predicted as negative it will be dangerous because it is contagious. But if predicted as positive the person will get unwanted quarantine which is a safer thing. FPR is better in this case than FN. (Correct me if I am wrong),True

@bharatchoudhary9836,2020-03-21T12:16:57Z,34,"In case of stock market crash or not prediction, false negative will be more important as if stock is predicted as not crash so you didn't withdraw money but actual it is crashed as result you lost money so here you are in loss(false negative),  Second case :- false positive where you predict stock market crash so you withdraw money but actual it is not crash so result you were not able to earn profit becoz you withdraw money .
