@HonestTalks-nd4cl,2023-09-17T08:49:25Z,0,I don't find quality in this content. you just rushed through decoders and did not explain internal mechanics of decoder. CampusX by Nitish is much better content quality wise. I don't know how you got this many subscribers and views.,True

@SimoneIovane,2020-06-16T18:12:25Z,1,"Thank for your video, I got a question though : I am not sure that the last output needs to be fed to the decoder, in fact only the final hidden state of the encoder gets passed to the decoder.  The first decoder input should be the target if we are using teacher forcing, or the start of sentence.  I learn't it from the Andrew NG course which I link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i3aqgKVNQI&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6F6wUI9tvS_Gw1vaFAx6rd6  Did I understand it wrong? Thanks",True
