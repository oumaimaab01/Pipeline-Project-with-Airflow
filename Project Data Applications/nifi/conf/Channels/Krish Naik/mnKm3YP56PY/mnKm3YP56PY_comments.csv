@georgekokkinakis7288,2024-02-13T22:12:20Z,0,"Have to say that your presentations really stand out , basically because of the distilled informations and to the point suggestions you make. One question though. At some point you talk about CNNs and that we have to use MinMax scaler. I am using CNN but on non image data, basically I see my data as an image of point values. Should I go with MinMax scaler or I could also use Standard scaler? And in order to be more specific lets say that I have an image of 7x7 where I want to keep the relative  value  differences  between a pixel and its neighbours. Which scaling should I use in your opinion? Can we use standarization on the dataset  in order to train a CNN or the values should be in [0,1] so we have to use minmax scaler. I am really interested to hear your opinion based on you experience.",True

Standardization, on the other hand, can be helpful in cases where the data follows a Gaussian distribution. However, this does not have to be necessarily true.
