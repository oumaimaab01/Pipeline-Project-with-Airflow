@KS-df1cp,2022-09-12T18:27:34Z,29,"I was working as tech support in India for 5 years after my BE. For some reason, I started thinking that I am meant to do much better than what I was working on and had the grit to do so. I left that job and came to the US to do my master's and my thesis in NLP. During engineering, our syllabus did not have any ML - DL courses, and I did not know even ""hello world"" in python!  Today I have a successful career in data science and I have 3+ years of experience. When I look at people's profiles, sure they all are younger than me and are doing much better than I did after N number of years of graduation. BUT!! Had I not made that transition 5 years ago, I may have been that person who has no idea what AWS and ML is! Hope it helps! Go for it! You got this!",True
