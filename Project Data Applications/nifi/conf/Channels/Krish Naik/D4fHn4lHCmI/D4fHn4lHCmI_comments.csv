@allieubisse470,2020-06-06T16:12:36Z,1,"Is  it not called Data Snooping/ fishing? I mean quickly eyeballing the Test data might lead to Human Bias.  The algorithm selected might be based on what you saw from the Test data.  Data Science competitions:  I see a lot of data Science competitions combining the Train and Test then Do Deep Dive analysis and preprocesing. According to my understanding this is wrong. I personally think that this is done to get more accuracy or overfit the public Leaderboard but i don't think is also applicable to the cooperate world.   What can we do with our test: All we may do is just few checks not going deep to association. Read about Data Leakage.  Human bias: Back to the Human bias, please discuss such. My understanding is to preproces with the Training data and learn some parameters from the training Data then inherit those to test. ----------  I always do train test split before Preprocesing. I make use of sklearn pipeline to avoid the loop of rewriting long code and reduce human error.   Final word.
