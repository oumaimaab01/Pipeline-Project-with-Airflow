@rajivsen3123,2020-02-02T18:05:08Z,3,"As I once said, QUANTUM Information science will engulf everything inside it.  And AGI is only possible and is sought after through QUANTUM computing only.   As well as several other Non - Convex extremely high dimensional Manifold Optimization problems and NP - Hard problems can only and solely  be tackled by principles Of QUANTUM physics/ Computing. And thus it will revolutionize pretty much every fields of human progress like Medecine, space, Genomics, Chaotic Systems, Quantum systems,  Molecular and Plqsma Dynamics,  Nuclear and Particle physics,  Combinatorial explosion problems, Unbreakable Cryptography and most definitely A.I. (which is just a tiny sliver in it).",True
