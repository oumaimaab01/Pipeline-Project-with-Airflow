@vishalverma5837,2022-08-22T14:54:39Z,0,I would say Decision Trees can handle outliers but one should be vigilant because outliers will not only impact nodes split but it will also have impact on nodes output value especially in the case of numerical features.,True

@KnowledgeAmplifier1,2020-11-16T13:15:14Z,1,"Sir , one statement is wrong I guess , ""It is not sensitive to outliers.Since, extreme values or outliers, never cause much reduction in RSS, they are never involved in split. Hence, tree based methods are insensitive to outliers.""... Decision Tree Classifiers are not sensitive to outliers , no doubt in that as in that case , median comes in the picture and median is not sensitive to outliers.... But when we are talking about Decision Tree regressor , then outlier increases the RSS , they will not involve in split , it's correct but they will increase the RSS which might affect the performance , so Decision Tree Regressors are sensitive to outliers",True
