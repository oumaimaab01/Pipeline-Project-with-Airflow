Could you make a video regarding methods to handle the outliers? Cause I have viewed all your video regarding handling the outliers, but the video just explained the technique to find the outliers (Z-score&box-plot), instead of method to handle the outliers. Except for removing the outliers, is there any other method? or removing the outliers was the best way? Hope you could make it. Thank you.",True

So, will it take away, most of the jobs available in this domain? I mean, what will happen to self learners then? Like, if I am doing a course from say, coursera, internshala, etc..., then i will be getting the certificates, but the students who will be doing it from iitm, they will be getting a degree.  So what do u prefer sir?   So, which one should I go for sir? Any suggestions plz  I know that certificates and degree doesn't matter unless we implement it. But apart from IMPLEMENTATION, say both the students (self learner and the ones who are doing this degree course) are doing the implementation, then which one will u prefer for hiring?
