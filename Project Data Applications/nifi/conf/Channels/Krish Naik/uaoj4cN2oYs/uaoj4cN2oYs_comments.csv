@mrchatterjee_,2019-09-03T12:05:44Z,1,"Hi Krish!  Thank you for your time and efforts that you're putting through this channel. I've been following your channel for over a month now. but I couldn't help but notice that I do not quite agree with you on what Random Variable is. The definition that you've given is totally different than what a Random Variable actually is.    Variable, as you said, it's a place holder which varies from time to time, however, a Random Variable is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random event that we can map to the numerical outcomes. Is it possible for you to clarify it in another video maybe?  A clear explanation of what RV would be:  https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library/random-variables-discrete/v/random-variables",True
