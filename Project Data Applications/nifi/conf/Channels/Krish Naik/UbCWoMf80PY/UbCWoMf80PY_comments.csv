@parthikbhandari6903,2019-10-16T01:55:17Z,2,"a DOUBT!!! Sir, I followed your steps and I loved it. I finally learned how to do this stuff. But I've got a doubt. You did internal CSS styling in this tutorial. When I started playing with things, I removed internal styling and did external styling just to make things optimized and easy. But after doing this change, when I again run the server, I cannot see any styling just plain HTML setup. Basically, I'm an ML guy and I don't know anything about webD, so I watched many tutorials to see if I can debug this, but to my bad, I cannot! Please help me. And afterward, when I again switched back to internal styling, everything got ok!    But I want to do external styling, it makes things easier when working with bigger projects.  Save me.",True
