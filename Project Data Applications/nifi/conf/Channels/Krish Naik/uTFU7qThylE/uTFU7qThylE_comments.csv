@krishnaik06,2021-04-01T05:32:19Z,6,The output that i got is wrong.. So will make this model better ussing CNN,True
@sand9282,2024-03-28T08:53:37Z,0,Sir isn't this problem a multi-label problem rather than a multi-class classification problem? I am asking because I can see 10 features in your target variable y. So in the case of multilabel problem won't you be using a 'Sigmoid' function rather than the 'Softmax'?,True

@santhosh20071993,2022-02-19T19:19:13Z,0,DropOut of .5 have to be used with caution. Basically we throw 50% of training features to a dustbin and same effect propagates to hidden layers,True

@marianagesheva9560,2021-11-28T01:24:14Z,0,Great series. One thing - I am getting an error at the end. AttributeError: 'Sequential' object has no attribute 'predict_classes' . I cannot  find out the predict_classes,True
@gregoiremafutala9897,2021-10-20T11:41:27Z,0,"Thank you Krish Naik for this video series that will help me in my research, it's a good job ;) 04:24 Given that we can rerun the model training several times and keep the updates in order to increase the accuracy of the model, if we manage to reach an accuracy around 90% just by rerunning the model training several times in a row, given that it will keep the updates and start the new training from the previous accuracies, does this amount to training the model over more epochs? Is this a good practice, will training the model in this way help it to generalize?",True
@deepaliaggarwal6429,2021-09-30T12:50:04Z,0,"Can we use similar preprocessing steps if I have audio of songs.. I am working on Music genre classification, so we can use the  MFCC concept ?",True

@yogeshwarshendye4857,2021-04-01T05:58:32Z,1,I have a question. You just trained the model two times each time with 100 epochs. Does that over-fit your model or what?,True
@aadityaparthasarathy4743,2021-04-01T05:47:01Z,4,Just a doubt. How do we listen to microphone in real time and then use that as input to a model? I want to make a web app out of it,True
