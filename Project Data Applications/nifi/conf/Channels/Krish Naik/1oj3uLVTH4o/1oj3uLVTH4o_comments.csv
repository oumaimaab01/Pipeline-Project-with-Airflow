@sgatea74,2024-03-17T20:26:07Z,0,"Learn STEM, learn Maths well and CS. AI today is an overhyped term. AI as an  overall domain includes Data Science / Machine Learning / Deep Neural Networks (CNN's, RNN's, etc.) LLM's are an application of NLP using sequenced RNN's (e.g. Transformers as encoder / decoder, or BERT as decoder only). These are models that are created by humans and not ""Devin"". These models are not able to rationalize, critical thinking, plan (etc.) And there is no evolutionary path towards AGI as originating from current technology.",True
