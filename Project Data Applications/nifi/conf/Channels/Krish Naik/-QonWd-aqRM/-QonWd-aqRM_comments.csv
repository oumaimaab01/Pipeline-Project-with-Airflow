@Machinelearning-to4ql,2023-12-03T18:14:49Z,0,"Dear ‚Äã @krishnaik06, I am currently enrolled in your Full Stack Data Science Job Guarantee Course at Ineuron (PWskills) and have completed an internship with Ineuron as well. Despite diligently following all the guidance provided, I have encountered challenges securing a job in the data field. Over the past couple of  months, I have consistently applied for positions, yet I have not received any responses from companies. It seems that many employers specifically seek candidates with prior experience in the data science field, often discounting internship experience as 'real job experience.' I have reached out to your support team via email, but unfortunately, I have not received a satisfactory response. I would appreciate any assistance or guidance if Ineuron (PW skills) can provide in addressing this situation.",True
