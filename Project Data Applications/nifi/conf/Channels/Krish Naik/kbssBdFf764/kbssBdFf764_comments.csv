@abhiasreddy,2021-04-21T01:42:51Z,2,"In Anomaly detection, Do you have the negative cases included  in the training set with this algorithm?  As per my understanding, you train it on cases where the data behaves normal, and then test it on data that contains both positive and negative and the task would then be to understand how well your model works on identifying those anomalies. Because the algorithm follows normal i=distribution, it would first need to understand what data belongs as normal ( positive). correct me if I'm wrong.",True
