Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you now and humbly ask for your forgiveness. LORD, I confess that I'm a sinner and I've broken your Holy Law. I realize that the penalty for sin is death. I believe that JESUS CHRIST suffered and died on the Cross to take the punishment for ALL of my sins. I believe JESUS rose from the dead and I accept Him as my personal Savior. From this moment forward I give you my heart and trust you to be the LORD of my life. Please forgive ALL of my sins and send your Spirit to help me do your will. I Love You, Lord Jesus. I Praise You, Jesus. I Thank You, Jesus. I shall follow you every day of my life.     I thank you for your great love and accept your gift of eternal life, and I pray these things in JESUS name, Amen﻿ . Say this prayer faithfully, no matter what you feel, when you come to the point where you sincerely mean each word, with all your heart, something good spiritually will happen to you. You will experience Jesus, and HE will change your whole life in a very special way. You will see. A single saint fights back, and a thousand demons cry in agony. And you are that saint.  Jesus Will Never Leave Nor Forsake You ''Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness. Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him and He shall bring it to pass.” Ps 37:3-5 Jesus Christ came into this world to reach those who feel that nobody cares. The Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in Him. The Lord Jesus Christ does care and He is reaching the lonely and the desperate, the confused and the hurt, the depressed and the disillusioned. Jesus Christ is reaching out to you.  “But God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Rom 5:8 As we turn away from our sin and turn to Christ we find forgiveness and freedom.  Jesus Christ is a Friend to the friendless. He is a Helper to the helpless.  He gives freedom to the addicts.  He loves the unloved.  He accepts the outcasts.  He changes the unchangeable.  He forgives the unforgivable.  He accomplishes the impossible.  He saves sinners.  He seeks the lost.  He gives direction to the aimless.",True

@rajatjaiswal7700,2020-12-27T10:52:57Z,12,"(13:55 )Sir by mistake you have said wrong i think, when we are giving import tensorflow command, it will show error if in our environment we have not included bin of cuda which we dnt need to paste in C drive I think. In environment we need to go to path as u guided and have to add "" bin "" present inside ""C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.0\bin"" . This worked for me. I may be wrong. Pardon me If wrong. I checked by going back in your video , ""C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.0\bin"" , already in path in your case.  while import tensorflow, it needs  cudart64_100.dll and in  cuda/bin we have cudart64_7.dll , so was giving error in my case.
