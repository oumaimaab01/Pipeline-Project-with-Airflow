@rahulranjan7567,2020-12-21T07:54:24Z,1,Python and CP is the worst combination one can go with. For starters google up all the red coders on CF. None code in Python. Its C++ and JAVA. So please refrain from using Python as CP language.  Yes it is good for those who want to learn DS. But for DSA it always good to go with low level language like C and CPP. It makes you more tough. Java and python with its automatic garbage collection makes you dull. No offense though.   I am using JAVA/CPP for DSA.,True

I have a small suggestion and i hope many others too would resonate with this, there are already numerous sources available on the internet for learning competitive programming. What we lack is quality content in data science and analytics for aspiring learners.
