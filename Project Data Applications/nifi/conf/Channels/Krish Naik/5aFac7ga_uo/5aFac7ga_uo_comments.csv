@nagusameta366,2023-08-21T13:31:31Z,0,"Hello, right know after I sign up in the Try Databricks for free page, and sign in, it is making me choose a subscription plan: Standard, Premium, Enterprise. It is not clear to me if Standard means 'Community Edition'. And it also mentions that 'By clicking continue you agree to Databricks terms and conditions. AWS will charge you for AWS resources used both during and after the free trial (for example, compute instances cost). Apply for free AWS credit.'   Do you think it is not free anymore?",True

Hence thumbs up!",True
