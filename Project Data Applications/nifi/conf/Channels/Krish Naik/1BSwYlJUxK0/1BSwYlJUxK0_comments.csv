@vicsteiner,2021-06-18T06:37:53Z,4,"Hey Krish, thanks for the video man. I was thinking on the issue of model degrading and I have a different point of view. I would not say that the model degrades but rather that the characteristics of the data used to train the model and the characteristic if the data the trained model receives as input later are more and more dispar even though the model still the same. Maybe it is just the way to say it but to me is not that the model degrades but more that data changes. That's why data monitoring is so important if we monitor basic statistics on our training data and continuously compare it to the data coming as input into our model the higher the differences between these statistics the higher the chance the model will work less properly. These can be used for build automated retraining triggers for example.",True
