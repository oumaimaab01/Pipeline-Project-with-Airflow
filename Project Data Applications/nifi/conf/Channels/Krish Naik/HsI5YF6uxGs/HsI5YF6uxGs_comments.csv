@Heisenberger_,2022-08-24T00:00:51Z,0,"Hello, sorry to burst your bubble, but you do realize that with selecting the date for the training dataset by < '20150101' is faulty and you have the complete year of 2015 in your train set & test set. Of course you have that high of a score through that. Select the dataframes like one should, by transforming the date into an actual date type and your results won't be better than a cointoss, worse even",True

@abhijit227,2021-11-24T21:23:46Z,0,"I dont know if anyone faced this issue while trying to implement with flask. Just a workaround that I came up with while trying to implement it.  Scenario: I saved the model and when I wanted to predict the class using some text using the saved model, the app threw error : ""X has 6 features, but RandomForestClassifier is expecting 598207 features as input"".  Well this is because I was trying to directly transform the test data without any vocabulary reference.   So when we want to predict with some test headline we have to first fit the countvectorizer with the training data (which acts as basis for dimensions to convert the data into vector). then transform our test data with the dimensions we get. train_data = clean_data_csv(train_data) transormed_data = []     for row in range(len(train_data.index)):         transormed_data.append(' '.join(str(text) for text in train_data.iloc[row, 0:25])) count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(2, 2))  count_vectorizer.fit_transform(transormed_data) data = count_vectorizer.transform(data)  However this is not optimum solution as every time we have to fit with the training data (Not ideal for huge data size). If anyone knows how to save the vectorized data and then use it later please reply to this comment.  Thanks Krish for amazing work :)",True
