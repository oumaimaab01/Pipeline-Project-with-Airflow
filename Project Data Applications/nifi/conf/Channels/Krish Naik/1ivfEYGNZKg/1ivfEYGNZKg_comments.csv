@mechashish006,2021-01-13T10:11:31Z,0,"Hello Krish,  First of all I would thank you for your youtube channel and your wonderful contributions for the knowledge transfer in the field of data science. My question here would be if you have any idea about the application of Datascience and ML and Deep learning methods  for cyber security in Automotive area- for example in autonomous driving, car2car communication etc. Would the technology there be very specific to ML-Methods or it would still include the general Datascience tools like Data cleaning and exploration etc.?  Can one after working in such a field, still switch to being a Datascientist in other non-automotive fields ? Thank you in advance for your time and a very happy new year :)  Warm regards Ashish",True
@arzoo_singh,2021-01-05T14:07:29Z,2,"I am just a CEH in cybersecurity ,so I thought of getting other certificates ,but it's adding too much expense .Anyhow I kept on learning from malware analysis ,to Assembly to penetration testing etc . But,I realised that data science has huge role to play in cybersecurity . Let me try to explain let's say you have most advanced IDS and IPS but some malwares will be more advanced then those security system . So,what is the solution ? The solution is AI ,the way a system works and the abnormalities when it's attacked ,what if you could use data science for log files and see some abnormalities or some deviation from standard working .",True
