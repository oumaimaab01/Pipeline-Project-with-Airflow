@yepnah3514,2020-11-28T22:24:02Z,1,"Hi! thanks for creating these videos. I have a question for you. I am trying to complete my capstone senior project on Elect Eng. As part of the project, I created a nn image model (cats, dogs). I used the random seed method to have some control over the initialized weights. My professor wants me to: create the model, and once it's created, he wants me to 'test the model' by changing the parameter weight values from  95%-103% and measure accuracy. the problem/confusing for me is, he wants me to change the weight values AFTER the model has been trained only once and then test each time i adjust the weights. I am confused because, don't you need to train the model every time you adjust the weight values? Do you have any idea as to what he wants me to do exactly? If you help me, i can put you as a reference in my project. the current model i have has a training, validation, and test/prediction sections already",True
