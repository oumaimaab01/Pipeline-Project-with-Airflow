An year consist of 2 terms and I have grades of student (a,b,c,d) in 6 different courses in 1st and 2nd terms now most of these grade columns of 6 different courses in 2nd term are missing. Intuitive I think it could be a reason for dropping out. My question is  1) Should I impute missing values in this case because it is possible that it is not missing those students already dropped out. So, should I create dummy variables 2) If I impute missing value what technique should I use to impute those missing categorical variables",True
