@masterpiyush666,2024-01-05T06:13:13Z,0,@Krish -  I would like to know if individuals without a background in Mathematics can pursue a course in Generative AI?,True
@RITOBANBHAT,2023-12-31T03:11:01Z,1,"I personally differ slightly on this point. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend a lot of time to learn the basics of data science, AI/ML theories and algorithms if you are not in the core of AI. Rest will mostly end up building business applications by calling APIs, let‚Äôs accept that. I had the same dilemma when I moved from c to VB many years ago until I accepted I didn‚Äôt need to know the implementation details of button, textbox, checkbox methods and properties. They exist, why to reinvent the wheel (unless you are the chosen one)?",True
@ahsanurrehmansiddiqui1506,2023-12-21T12:45:38Z,0,people always underestimate the basics. and the magic always lies there.,True
@armaanzshaikh1958,2023-12-20T03:28:09Z,0,Totally agree sharing my experience i completed statisitcs and there was a community session started on generative ai which i watched on the first day in that after discussion of syllabus it started with deep learning algo where somethings were bouncer and some were understandable so that made me rethink that if i would know ML And DL this would be just done easily so got back to start the foundation in Ml yes you can build the LLM using python but at the end what Krish said is totally true,True
@teja789,2023-12-14T16:13:32Z,0,Agree with you krish,True

@kumargaurav2170,2023-12-13T10:13:44Z,1,While it's easier to work with close source models without learning basics but if one wants to work with Open source models for custom data then you might get stuck on your use case,True
@gpgyanp,2023-12-12T14:06:11Z,0,Can you please provide some light on courses for Business leaders / Pre sales leaders / Business Consulting for Generative AI? As they are more focus on the business use cases.,True
@piyushtalele3594,2023-12-12T13:21:35Z,1,"So what are the bare minimum topics that need to be covered required for LLM models. I am asking this because companies are really impatient with regards to the implementation of use cases using LLM. Actually it has become a statement popular like ""LLM has made AI easy to use and implement. Even for non ML developers""",True
@sgatea74,2023-12-11T21:51:30Z,1,"No you can not ""Learn GenAI"" without knowing the rules governing to its implementation. Coding is enabling the learning of the rules. For regular users experimenting Chat GPT it is Ok-ish (considering hallucinations)",True

@akhileshsharma0145,2023-12-10T20:23:55Z,9,00:01 Learning generative AI without machine learning or deep learning 01:19 Learning the basics before jumping into generative AI is important. 02:33 Python is a prerequisite for directly using generative AI APIs. 03:41 It's good to learn machine learning basics before diving into generative AI. 04:47 Deep learning basics are crucial for interviews 05:54 Basic knowledge of statistics and machine learning concepts is essential for working on LLM projects. 07:07 Learning generative AI alone may not be sufficient for interviews. 08:19 Basics in machine learning and deep learning are essential before diving into generative AI.,True
