@oe10s024,2022-05-14T21:22:31Z,0,"Need to check two things:  1. In PERSON table, when you drop index (uc_person), it drops Age from unique key. However, it keeps first_name as a unique key because it was assigned unique_key initially. Can you please explain this?  2. In PERSON1 table, last_name was not assigned to NOT NULL. Later, last_name was assigned as a primary key and subsequently dropped from the primary key. Although it was dropped from the primary key, it remains NOT NULL. Can you please explain this?",True
