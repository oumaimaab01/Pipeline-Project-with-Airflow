@priyanshuvats4066,2020-06-27T07:18:46Z,0,"Scaling features helps make gradient descent faster by changing the shape of the cost function Also, it improves the performance of distance-based models by reducing bias. Here is a link for deeper understanding. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3xPA7XFGCQ",True
@us12345,2020-06-22T06:18:02Z,0,"Hello sir,  I have a doubt after scaling the data converted into 0 to 1 values and if we predict we get also result in scaled form but what if we want to give the data for prediction in a know value of data and get the result in know form. How to do this please help ?",True
@ansylpinto2301,2020-05-31T08:48:08Z,0,Using sklearn if we fit the scaling methods on the training data but the min max is different for test data can the transformed data have range outside what would have been expected? Similarly for standardization if the mean and standard deviation is different for test what effect it will have on the model?,True
