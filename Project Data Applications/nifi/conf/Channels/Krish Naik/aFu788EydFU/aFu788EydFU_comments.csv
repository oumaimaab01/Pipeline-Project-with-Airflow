@krishnaik06,2021-08-01T07:06:40Z,5,Please note the additional delay with respect to training in Google colab was because of pulling the images from Google drive. But compartively found Helios predator better,True
@techie_gangwar,2022-10-19T17:13:58Z,0,Can we train Resnet-50 or VGG16 kind of models on this laptop? Or any laptop with 6GB VRam 3060RTX?,True
@datasciyinfo5133,2022-08-04T07:03:22Z,1,"At first I thought this was exactly what I was looking for, but actually it doesn't show the true speed of Colab (Pro or free).  He never showed even one clip of the time on running epochs on the Colab side, just that the Laptop side took 4s 209 ms/epoch.  And the example had very few images as far as deep learning tasks go, so it would not have taxed even a low-budget CPU laptop.  Tesla P100 depends on bandwidth speed from the user to the server AND from google drive to colab gpu server.  Images should definitely have been uploaded directly to the Colab server before loading.  Still, the delay is far too long on the colab side.  I assume it is because of very slow internet connection from the user to Colab servers.  It's OK as a concept video to show that you CAN do deep learning on a RTX 3060 laptop.",True
@aravindetagi4008,2022-07-16T08:08:51Z,1,Loading images directly from drive takes time..... It is better to copy zip data from drive to colab environment and unzip in colab environment then procede the training.... Then it will take less time,True
@enjoylife8199,2022-07-03T15:19:51Z,1,What about Aus ROG vs TUF and Acer do we require hz for deep learning as 165 hz- 300 hz price range increases by nearly 10-20k,True
@Jaydeep-ve4jy,2022-03-09T09:15:38Z,1,"Hi Krish, thank you so much for this video, i was too interested in trying this out on my gaming laptop. I have an Asus TuF F15 with RTX 3050, i am sure this is not at par with RTX 3060 but would definitely like to tryout the way you did. Love your teaching keep up the good work.",True
