Histograms group data into bins for visualization. 01:24:14 📄 PDF (Probability Density Function) is a way to smooth histograms for continuous data, representing probability distribution functions.

Eg: Military ranks, Class ranks.  3. Interval: Numeric or Categorical, it has an order, it has value, '0' absolute zero point not present. Eg: Fahrenheit temperature. There can be 95F and 100 F temperatures. The value of the difference between 80 and 85 is the same as the difference between 90 and 95.  0 F does not represent any meaning. 4. Ratio: Numeric or Categorical, Order matters, Value matters, Has absolute zero point. Eg: Kelvin scale. Having  0 K is having the lowest energy of water. The difference between the 2 temperatures also matters. Each temperature has its value.   Some other examples: Customer satisfaction: satisfied, very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied -> Ordinal  Hat, Shirt, Shoes, Pant -> Nominal City of birth -> Nominal Income -> Ratio GPA -> Interval  Happy learning!!
