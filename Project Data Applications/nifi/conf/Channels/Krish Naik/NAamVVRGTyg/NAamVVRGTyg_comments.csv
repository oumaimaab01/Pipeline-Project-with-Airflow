@infinitedata7088,2021-08-08T10:00:22Z,1,"Krishna Sir.... Actually I have attend interview, they ask me about Data science related question, I answered them. But they asked 3  coding questions related competitive programming. I'm not able to solve 2  out 3 .  But They took one coding test related to data scrapping & I solved that question but they rejected me ?  Remaining interview was good.  My question to you is  does competitive programming required for data science roles ? if yes what are the question we have to prepare ? Coding Questions asked in interview: 1. If a & b is input are remains  same how we can increase  output every time by 2 ? - Solved but they said it wrong approach  2. They give me n = 568, write a code for finding next ramanujan number after the n? - Not able to solve 3. They gave me a json file, asked about unique keys , How many values has type list? -  Solved  & Final question for data scrapping  They provided a website & told me to extract specific amount of data . -  This one is I solved correctly   experience. Can you suggest more on this",True
