@khalidal-reemi3361,2021-09-02T12:25:11Z,0,"Thanks Krish for this video.  My question is : Should we split ""human_texts"" into train & test before applying count vectorizer. ??? The test split shouldn't have been included in cv.fit(). I think this will avoid overfitting.  Moreover when predicting new unseen data, It will surely not be included in the count Vectorizer fitting process. but we will apply  cv.transform only to it.",True

Then enhances deficiencies we are born with and makes spoken languages of other native speakers understood like your own spoken language even if you read different languages oo.,True

@ramp2011,2019-06-28T22:46:33Z,0,Thank you for the great video.  Creating 232k columns is little daunting especially when you have lots of rows. Got to have a huge machine to handle such volumes of data.  I am also curious why you choose 4 for the ngram. Why not 3 or 5? What made you choose 4? Thank you,True
