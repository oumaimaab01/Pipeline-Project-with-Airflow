@parthadx7ster,2020-09-06T15:39:35Z,2,Hi Krish. I have subscribed to your channel because you have good content.if I may please allow me to critique on your presentations.   Your material is good. I recommend the following.  1. Go slow 2. Write gown the steps  in a slude and show it to viewers. 3. Dont mix or jump from one para to another. Viewers lose the connection and can't make out the real message. 4. Present your thoughts with good example. Preferably with a problem statement and a schematic.  Hope this helps. Please keep up the good effort.,True
