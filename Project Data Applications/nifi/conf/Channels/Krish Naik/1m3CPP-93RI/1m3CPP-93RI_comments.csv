@69nukeee,2024-03-26T10:40:13Z,0,"For some reason, I cannot make the 'pip install -r requirements.txt' work (roughly at 36:40 something in the video). I have successfully done (a few times already!) the steps before, I made sure I selected the venv environment in terminal but I don't understand what the issue is. If I got it correctly, 'pip install -r requirements.txt' should instruct setup.py into creating the packages as defined within the requirements.txt file. Krish, do you first need to run setup.py before  'pip install -r requirements.txt' maybe? I am kinda stuck and have been for a few days as I don't understand what am I doing wrong. Any guidance would be much appreciated, as I love this video and I find it amazingly inspiring onto my quest for understanding what a proper end-to-end data science project may be.
