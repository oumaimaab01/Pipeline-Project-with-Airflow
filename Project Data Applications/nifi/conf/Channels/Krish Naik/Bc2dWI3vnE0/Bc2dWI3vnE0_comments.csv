@lakeguy65616,2022-05-21T20:21:17Z,0,"so, your ""model"" to pick a model structure picked the biggest, deepest structure.  wasn't that the outcome you expected?  I mean adding more hidden layers should create a model that trains quicker.  Adding more neurons per layer would also train quicker.  The bigger the structure (layers, neurons per layer) will train quicker but also reach the point where it no longer generalizes but memorizes the data. And in general, ReLu is better than Sigmoid.",True

@budhadityagoswami5420,2021-06-21T14:30:03Z,3,"A clear decent description of the GridSearch CV approach to find out the hyper parameters of a NN. However a couple things to mention: 1. The logic is not clear why we suddenly choose three layers with 20 , (40,20) , (45,30,15) etc? How dis you select them? 2. Standardization does help to get faster convergence but it NEVER ensure a gobal minima. It is stochastic gradient decent that is used as a backbone of tensorflow ensures the global minima if your cost function is convex or pseudoconvex 3. Your confusion matrix for accuracy is really fishy!! Why the 2nd column of confusion matrix is completely 0 ? It means the model can not capture any of the churned cases at all. Accuracy might still be high because of high imbalance. Can you explain? Am I missing anything here?",True

However, it is very disappointing to see that it simply tells to run the model on different numbers of 'number of layers' and check the accuracy.
