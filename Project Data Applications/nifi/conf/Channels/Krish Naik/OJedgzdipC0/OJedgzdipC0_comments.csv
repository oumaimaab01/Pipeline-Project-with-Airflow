@abhinavgarg4884,2023-05-26T10:24:45Z,0,"Hey mate, I am applying the same method of random oversampling my class imbalance ratio is like 99:1(0:1 classes). But since I'm building a model I'm allowed to do this just on the training split to keep test data without any noise for later predictons. And when I predict on test dataset my precision and recall comes like 0.1 0.1 percent which could be possibly due to false negatives. How do I fix this. Help would be appreciated 🙏 @krishnaik06",True

@shefalisingh4675,2022-04-30T15:25:03Z,0,"Hi Krish, thanks for the video, but I do have a question if we handle the imbalanced data then there is a change of adding outliers to our dataset, so we should be removing those outliers before building our model?? And there won't be a scenario that all the new samples added will be outliers?? And the second question after applying any algorithm if we train our model then it will have a high chance of overfitting our model. How do we handle that scenario?",True
