@KnowledgeAmplifier1,2020-10-24T07:59:49Z,3,"Sir , I have one doubt regarding the Robustness of Regression Tree towards Outliers.  Regression tree split criterium depends on the averages of the two groups that are splitted, and, as the average is severely affected by outliers, then the regression tree will suffer from outliers. Whereas Classification Tree uses Mode which in not affected by outliers ... So when we say ""Decision trees are robust to outliers"", we mean Decision Tree Classifier , not Regressor.  So I think Regression Tree are affected by outliers :-/",True
@mlvali1350,2020-10-16T17:41:12Z,1,After applying this technique and i plot the box-plot again its showing outliers in boxplot. y,True
@sajidchoudhary1165,2020-10-13T06:43:33Z,1,i also think so KNN Classifier  is sensitive to outliers and you also told in one video KNN Classifier is Sensitive and DBSCAN is'nt  sensitive to outliers because it handle outliers by itself it don't consider  outliers in Clusters,True
@mahesh1234m,2020-10-08T05:47:19Z,10,"In Naive Bayes , Outliers will affect the shape of Gaussian distribution. That is the Outliers would have impact on the mean and standard deviation  of the bell curve., So Naive Bayes is sensitive to Outliers.",True

@KnowledgeAmplifier1,2020-08-31T04:03:40Z,1,"KNN may be affected by outliers , but weighted knn is not for sure as weight proportional to 1/distance & for outlier , it has abnormal high distance from rest of the dataset , so weight is going to be very less & as a result , outliers will be less impactive  :-)",True
@abhinaygupta8243,2020-08-25T20:26:15Z,1,if  distribution is left skewed then we have to replace all left hand values  less than -3S.D. with -3S.D. to make it normally distributed?,True
