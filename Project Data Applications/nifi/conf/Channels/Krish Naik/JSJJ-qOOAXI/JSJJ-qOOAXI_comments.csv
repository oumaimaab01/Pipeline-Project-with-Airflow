@BiancaAguglia,2019-08-30T17:07:44Z,31,"1:00 ""Learning Python is just like a cup of tea."" üòä Well said. I love this quote from data scientist Joel Grus: ""I'm hesitant to call Python my favorite programming language. There are other languages I find more pleasant, better designed, or just more fun to code in. And yet pretty much every time I start a new data science project, I end up using Python. Every time I need to quickly prototype something that just works, I end up using Python. And every time I want to demonstrate data science concepts in a clear, easy-to-understand way, I end up using Python."" üòä",True
