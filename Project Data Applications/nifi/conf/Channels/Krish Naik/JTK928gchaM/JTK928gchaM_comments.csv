@ashishmehra5143,2024-03-22T09:45:39Z,0,Nothing is easy but one has to make a choice. There has to be a plan-B. Experienced data scientists are finding it hard to switch jobs and no one is hiring freshers. YouTubers and cheap institutes like Coding Invaders are selling the data science courses and making buckets of money abusing the dreams of freshers and professionals who want to switch to a better job.,True

@vetrivelr5708,2024-03-22T01:29:52Z,0,Thank you Krish‚ù§  I have started DS 4 years back. Am non tech background with 13 Years of experience. I learned python so far with some automation projects in my company.   Due to inconsistency was not able to achieve DS. Also I don't know any maths concepts. However I didn't quit. Is that still possible to achieve it? As lots of things eveloved now.   Because I don't know how much in an area should learn. Like in maths and statistics how's much I should learn. Especially from ML I can't move further or start either. That is where I am still facing issue. I am still fighting for it  Can you please guide me if this message reaches you.,True
