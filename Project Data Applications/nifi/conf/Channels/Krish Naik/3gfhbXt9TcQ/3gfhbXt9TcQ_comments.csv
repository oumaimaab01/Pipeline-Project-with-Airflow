@moonSTAR1893,2023-08-17T14:37:07Z,0,"Hello. Important mistake in this tutorial, so I have to stop watching it.  Problem: you e.g. use MinMax Scaler on whole X_train with differently scaled variables inside. Let's assume ""age"" is distributed 18-65 while ""fare"" goes from 5-2000. Scaling age with the global min/max of the dataset, distorts your features. In this case for age 20 you would get   z = X-Xmin/Xmax-Xmin = (20-5)/(2000-5) = 15/1995= 0.0075. Instead in the per-feature scaling with just age you would get z = (20-18)/(65-18) = 0.0426 corresponding to a 5-fold numerical difference.  The maximal age of 65 would get z = (65-5)/(2000-5) = 0.03 !!!! Meaning age would have maximal value of 0.03 instead of 1!",True

@SomeoneElsesSomeoneElse,2022-01-31T20:09:47Z,1,"With respect to StandardScaler() If you split the dataset prior to scaling the features then don't you risk having skewed features?  Put differently, if you train your model to learn that values of 1 get a certain weight and in your test set the data isn't standardized around the same mean as the train set then the model will invariably have worse accuracy unless the train set and test set features have the same mean, right?  Shouldn't the test set samples of the full dataset removed only to serve as an ""out-of-sample"" test?  Not two separate datasets?",True

@mdadilhussain2967,2021-06-07T11:52:06Z,2,"I guess that you should first do fit_transform then train_test_split; As if you have first splited then according to train data you have calculated mean. Then applies same mean for test data, so test data won't have mean as zero. Please clear this doubt.",True
@venkatraaman4509,2021-06-01T11:05:01Z,2,"hai, for eg I have a feature regarding age, height, weight  now I willing to make the gaussian transformation, here in my case  ==>logarithm tx makes a good fit for age  ==>reciprocal  tx makes a good fit for height the question is may I use both features(applied with age(log tx) & height(reciprocal tx)) for my train data, kindly reply to me, sir",True
