@santhosh86fun,2021-08-11T17:45:16Z,10,"Hi Krish, I'm a senior sales professional with 8 + years of experience in sales and business development. After 1st pandemic, I lost my job and since then, I had been in process to learn Data Science (Actually w.r.t. Data Analyst) like Python, My SQL and Advanced Excel, Data Visualization Tools (Power BI). But, I've not gone into Stats, Deep Learning, Machine Learning stuffs. As I'm also into a situation to get a job. Due to different reasons, I did lose some interviews from my sales profile and I continue to be jobless, for almost an year. Only positive thing is, I didn't lose hope and learning process is still on. However, I still struggle to create a proper Data Science or Analyst Resume to apply for jobs and I also lack of the relevant experience in data analysis. I know, there are videos available in your playlist, which will have answers. But, I request you to make a video for people like me from completely different profile (like field sales). Videos on How to choose the projects from i-neuron to get that experience and also highlight the resume.  Thanks for reading all the way down.   If you are making any video, based on my request. I believe it will be useful for many.",True
