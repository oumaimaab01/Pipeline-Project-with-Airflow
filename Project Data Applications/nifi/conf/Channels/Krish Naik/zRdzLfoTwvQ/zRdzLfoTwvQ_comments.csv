@JoeYoung91PRS,2023-07-06T14:30:29Z,1,"Great video! Had a question if you don't mind. I was playing with your example and I'm confused about where its actually pulling the temperature information from. The get_current_weather function does a get against find_places. This API endpoint only returns location data, not weather/temperature. However, I can see its able to pull the temperature from somewhere (albeit, incorrect data). I would log the requests but it looks like the standard requests and openai logging doesn't log function calls (still trying to figure this out). Any ideas on where its pulling the temp from? Thanks",True
