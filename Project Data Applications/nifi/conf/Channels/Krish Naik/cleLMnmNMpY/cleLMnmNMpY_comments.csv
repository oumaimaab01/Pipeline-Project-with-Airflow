@VVV-wx3ui,2019-08-20T16:16:33Z,8,"I like the way you conduct the session and its full of passion. I Like It Krishna.  Yes, its would be helpful to go draw parlance with the Human Brian, that is,  Dendrites are branches of the Soma (Cell Body) and passes output thru synapses that are connected to other cells. So, if applied in NN, Inputs are Dendrites and Node is the Nucleus/Cell Body; the output passes thru Axon to the node in the next layer. In ANN, cell body is referred as Perceptron. Dendrites is Input variables and output is passes thru Axon and Output (to next layer or final)  is Synapse.     I learnt above elsewhere and thought of sharing. I am your subscriber and wish to see many sessions covering various topics in DataScience arena.  Please keep doing coming video sessions for beginners like me. Thanks a Ton Krishna.",True
