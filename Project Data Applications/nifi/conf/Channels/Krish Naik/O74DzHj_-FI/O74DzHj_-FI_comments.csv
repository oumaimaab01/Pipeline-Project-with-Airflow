@lightning369,2022-04-02T04:16:41Z,4,"Krish Naik is so humble, friendly and outgoing. This is what makes a great man. He is awesomely resourceful with the much needed information in Data Science alongside other courses and an impactful visionary. His way of explaining things is awesomely on another level. Something in him draws one attention to what he is explaining. I believe iNeuron is a one-stop university for Data Science and will similarly be for other courses as the platform grows. . Keep up the good work Krish Naik and the iNeuron Team.",True

If that is the case the internship doesn't hold any value 2moro any one can build website ask ppl to do some internship which is few project updated in a bucket and get certified. I just want your point on this that if everyone are doing project for the clients disclose the client or certify people with client name entered in certification,True
