@vahiagyat,2021-01-09T21:38:24Z,4,"That's great! Always admired you and Sudhanshu for all the hard work you guys are doing!  Regarding site: It's looking great, just a few minor things that I noticed. Course section:  * Overall look and feel are as per industry standard. Udacity has a pretty similar interface. I will not comment about UX because it's the company's personal choice but when we select a course-> on the next page the blue color in the background banner is little offsetting - it's kind of hiding the video card paced there. * Captcha was not working a couple of times but then onwards it's working fine - I am assuming the platform is getting stabilized. * There are various filters on the course page. These are made as radio buttons - my personal thought or I would (As a user) will prefer them as checkboxes, so that I can select multiple filters. For example, if I want to select Data Science and AI both - currently I have to do the one by one. *Some courses are blank - I am assuming videos will be coming soon. For example DSAR by Sudhanshu - it's blank. P.S: Correction, videos are there but not showing on the main dashboard. On the main dashboard clicking the category/project just change plus to minute (expanded - collapse)  Product Page: * when I click on the product (just the product title) then nothing happens. Whereas in the course page if I click on the 'course' it opens the page with all the courses. Ideally, this should be the behaviors. But in case this is not planned to be done then we should maintain consistency throughout the website.  * When I select a particular product - let's say ""Auto Neuro"". It takes me to the page where it asks me to upload the excel. For a first time user, I have no clue what Auto Neuro is what's expected from me to be uploaded! I know when we go in the documentation--> how to then it shows the product main page - https://autoneuro.ml/. I feel this should be the main page opening when someone clicks - product--> Auto Neuro.  * There are some spelling and grammatical mistakes. For us it's fine but when viewed by prospective clients - it will not look good.  Contact Us Page: * Mobile number - when entered 10 digits mobile number it adds +91 in front of it. There is already a separate box for country code. So I think adding +91 in the main number is not required to be shown in the UI - in the backend yes that's fine. * Country code and Mobile number length - Not all countries will have 10 digits or 9 digit numbers. It doesn't work for Aruba (for example).  My Profile Page: * Change PAssword is not intuitive - it will be better if we can put text change password. * Domain - I was not able to find a domain for myself :) or any management person in the IT industry - Product Manager, Program Manager, Product director, etc.  I have sent the above feedback on the email too - support@ineuron.ai",True
