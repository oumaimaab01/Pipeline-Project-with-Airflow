@user-wy4ge3yu4h,2024-02-26T14:44:11Z,0,"Thanks Krish this helped me finally understand Bernoulli's distribution. Word of advise to anyone who is reading this, just take Bernoulli's distribution like it is not a distribution like when you draw a histogram with matplotlib on continuous data. See it as a tool to calculating probability of success of failure in one event",True
