@BiancaAguglia,2019-10-23T09:49:14Z,5,"Three more good things to have:      1. a problem solver's attitude,      2. creativity, and      3. curiosity.  In an article on Quora, a hiring manager at a tech talent company said she was disappointed to see how often candidates said they didn't learn certain things in school, or they couldn't find a textbook to help them find certain problems. Her message was that in life, more often than not, the answers to your problems won't be in textbooks. You have to go out of your way and create your own learning opportunities and your own solutions. That's what problems solvers actually do. üòä",True
