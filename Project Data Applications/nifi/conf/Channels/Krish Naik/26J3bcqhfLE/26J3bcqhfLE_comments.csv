@mathswitha.c6403,2021-07-17T16:24:42Z,0,"Hi Sir Can you please help me with this:  My task is to write a python program that uses training data to choose the four ideal functions which are best fit out of the 50 provided. i. Afterwards, must use the test data provided to determine for each and every x-y pair of values whether or not they can be assigned to the chosen ideal functions,if so,the program needs to execute the mapping and save it together with the deviation at hand. ii. All data must be visualized logically iii. Where possible,create/compile suitable unit-test The criterion for choosing the ideal functions for the training function is how they minimize the sum of all y-deviations squared(Least-Square). The criterion for mapping the individual test case to the four ideal functions is that the existing maximum deviation of the calculated regression does not exceed the largest deviation between training dataset (A) and the ideal function(C) chosen for it by more than factor square. I have attached the pics for the datasets involved. I appreciate any help I will get,thank you!",True

IA quick question is that are the predictions from Linear Regression and Direct Multioutput Wrapper with LinearSVR always the same for any multioutput regression problem? Actually, my case has two inputs and two outputs (6 examplesÔºâ, but I have very different results from LinearReg and LinearSVR Wrapper, does that mean there is something wrong  in my code?
