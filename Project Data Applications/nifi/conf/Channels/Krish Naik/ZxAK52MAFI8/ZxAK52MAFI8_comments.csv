@taki1jeden1,2022-06-24T14:19:52Z,8,"My favourite tip for data science interview is to be prepared as much as possibile about your projects and gently including answers for questions the interviewer could Ask. For example I used xgboost for classification for imbalanced dataset so i know they may Ask how to fight overfitting, what is oversampling, how tree based algorithms work, what is boosting and I include that cery gently in my presentation before they start asking questions. In that way I avoid the possibility of misunderstanding questions etc.  The other advice is to prepare some interesting questions about company, how teams are builded, if they are using Agile, what is data scientist responsible for, if do they have ml engineers, data engineers, analysts etc. Everytime I asked such questions I was complimented for that.",True
