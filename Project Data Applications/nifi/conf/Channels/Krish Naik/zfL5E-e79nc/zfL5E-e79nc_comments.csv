@mohit6001,2021-08-19T21:47:42Z,0,"Hi Krish, just a clarification.. Did Deep only stick to your channel videos or is he mentioning the iNeuron Data Science course of which are a part? Why I am asking this is because I have a similar sort of a background, non technical with 7 years of experience into insurance but working more with data, and I also want to switch to Data Analytics and I also found iNeuron's course curriculum too lengthy and overwhelming. Request you to please reply on this as I'm going through a big dilemma as to where to study from. By the way, went through some of your stats videos, they are really amazing. You are doing a great job. Wish you all the happiness and success. üôÇ",True
