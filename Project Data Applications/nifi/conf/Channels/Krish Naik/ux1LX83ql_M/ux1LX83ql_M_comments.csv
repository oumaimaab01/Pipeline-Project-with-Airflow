@datahat642,2022-08-22T18:42:57Z,0,"The use case of notifying the owner about potential servicing required and adjusting the internal temperature could be handled separately as: part-1--> anomaly detection in the mechanics of the engine, braking system, steering accuracy, suspension  part-2--> regulating the temperature is more of an optimizing problem, where a thermostat installed on the outside of the vehicle could be used to send signals for adjusting the temperature of the Air conditioner in the vehicle.",True
@datahat642,2022-08-22T18:28:05Z,0,"For the very first use case on recommendation system. Since a rule based system was already in place, it is safe to assume that we have a dataset comprising of user records and the various policies purchased by them. Further down, if we consider that we log in the click-through rate of the recommendations as well the other policies checked in by users, collaborative recommender system could be built. Additionally, for users who already have a history of purchases, a combination of collaborative and content-based recommendation would be very useful. On the evaluation front, instead of measuring the accuracy of the recommendation, top-k accuracy would be a more suitable choice.   Some scenarios could fall into place: The company would miss out on recommending certain policies due to a lower rank score on the recommendation system (probably, historically customers did not purchase certain policy types). Instead of merely recommending the policies based on applicability, certain attribute based recommendation such as how convenient would a certain policy be for an individual as compared to the previous policies, should be combined along with other policies.   Most important thing about policies, is to maximize the revenue on the part of the insurance company as well as providing convenience and hassle free-service to the policy holders.",True

@muneebanwar1982,2022-08-08T23:08:29Z,0,For the second problem the actual problem here is to minimize inventory costs because if you overestimate the materials needed you need extra space and the money used on the extra inventory could have been better used elsewhere this is pretty much a demand forecasting problem from operations research I think there are alot of models for this already I remember reading about it in a book,True

@ojaskulkarni2378,2022-08-08T17:43:38Z,3,"1st use case: Recommendation system for insurance company Sol:  User features that can be considered => age, salary, marital status, family size, dependent parents, current/past illnesses, place of residence, demographics of the area (like population, literacy, etc) which can be found through reliable online resources.  Based on user features & features of the insurance plan we can use a content based filtering recommendation system.  2nd use case: Forecast pre-pocessed food product raw material pocurement (like Frooti or any juice) Sol: Features:  type of raw material,  availability/price of raw material across the year,  cost involved in storing the raw material in inventory demand over the pas years.  Challenges:  inavailability of raw material due to rainfall or any other natural causes transportation problems like material handling. sudden fall in demand due to factors like defamation, competition, etc.  Model: Use linear regression to forecast demand from past year data.  with predictor being year, population of the area and response being the predicted demand (no of products).  requirement for all the raw materials = (qty of raw material req/product) x (demand) The procured mangoes may also have some defective pieces so we need to consider 1-2% margin over that. Can perform RFM analysis to Recency, Frequency and Monetary to identify key demographics  3rd use case: Recommend cosmetic products based on facial features Sol: We can either Use DeepFace model to extract facial features and use those features to recommend the cosmetic using decision tree classifier or content based filtering recommendation system or Directly feed the model with Face data use it to predict the product from available products by treating it as a classification problem.  Possible Challenges: Bad images,  falsely identified marks on face, sometimes the gender may also be incorrectly identified  4th use case: Maintenance alarm and AC temp adjusting model Sol: Take input from sensors in the car located in various components. Use time-series analysis to determine failure/maintenance criteria set by the standards. Combine all the data and using models based on RNN/LSTM predict the maintenance due date from current date. Convert the time into distance-based average daily kms and inform the owner 5000 kms prior to maintenance due kms.  We'll need to consider parameters like comfort, battery or fuel usage, slope which the car is climbing, current speed of the car to adjust AC temp. Like when climbing a slope we must turn off the AC or when the temp outside is very high we can go to lower temp but that would also depend on fuel availability. Considering all such factors we can first try to find if the problem can be solved using linear/polynomial regression or we would need an ANN(which would also involve additional hardware in the car). So that choice again depends on car-to-car.",True

@sinha3506,2022-08-08T16:06:29Z,7,"1. Recommendation System: When a person log in, get all the information regarding the person like what product he/she likes, what does the person prefer, get the browsing history of that person. Now based on the product he/she buys, we can set item-based filtering recommendation or collaborative -based filtering. Now, to tackle the cold start problem, whenever a new person comes in for the first time, show what products does he/she likes, show the tags. Once we have the data we get specific based on tag and at least show some recommendation.  2. Facial Recognition: First we have to determine what are all the range pf products available i.e.what products are available for what part of the face. We have to check if the person is male or female. Train a model or use a pretrained model which will get the facial characteristics of the face, like if it detects a beard then recommend beard oil or a trimmer. For the female recommend cream, lotion based on the marks, spots on the face. This can be done with uploaded photos or real time camera using openCV. Similarly, like the previous to tackle cold start problem, show what products he/she is interested in, show the tags, get the history etc.  3. Logistic Procurement: The main objective here I believe is to show whether or not we need more material or less material for the product. This is a kind of optimization problem where we are minimizing the raw materials needed. I have 2 approach for this-   a. First one is model based. First, we have to see what different types of juice are there to make. Based on that we have to see the material we need to build the product. We have get all the characteristics/features of the juice which contributes in using raw materials more or less. We can build a model based on those and either predict whether it will use more or less material (binary classification task) or predict what is amount of material the product is going to use (linear regression task).    b. The second way is based on heuristic approach. If the product use different material to to be build i.e. let say some amount of each 'n' material to make a product. Now to minimize the amount needed for each material we can use genetic algorithm to get that or other optimization algorithm to do that.Though this not so efficient, if we have lets say 100 products each using 'n' materials type as we have to do for all.  4. Car Problem: This use case is in kinda broad spectrum. I am no knowledge in car making but still answering it.   a. Damage Detection: A car has many parts inside and outside the body. We can separate damage detection in terms of ""analog i.e. mechanical parts and digital i.e. in software parts"".       i. For the damage detection in mechanical parts like brakes, engine, tires etc. we can build a model which can detect damage and do segmentation of that part. For this to happen we need to install camera inside the engine hood and underneath the car. A damage can be detected not only by images but with sensors too. The car software can analyze the data to get a warning like this parts seems fishy, kindly check it out.      ii. For the damage in the software parts, show warning about the software parts. To make it work both side needs to work together.    b. AC control: First off sense the outside temperature via sensor, sense the inside of the car also, get the temperature from both sides, then don't turn on the AC immediately just show a prompt on the screen whether or not turn on the AC. Let's keep the action on the user part. Imagine if someone has cold inside the car and suddenly it turn on the AC, good luck. Or imagine the person doesn't want the AC, he/she can pull down the windows.",True
@vaishupriya1784,2022-08-08T15:53:19Z,2,For 1st use case..we can first do clustering and segment customers into different groups and then we could apply multi-class classification based on previous data on each segment and built recommendation system based on classification results,True

@samuelogunlola5071,2022-08-08T13:55:40Z,8,"For the use case 1 (recommendation system).   First we would need a lot of demographic information about the customers (already existing) . Do a deep dive analysis on triggers or the type of insurance they fall into. A groupby would be a nice way to check,  Secondly, just the same way an RFM analysis is done in the financial sector, check the recency, frequency and product/insurance groups you have created in the first steps. Try binning them ranking from 1 to 5 or n (depending on the distribution of the data. )   (Do a little visualization to see if the behavioral partner is captured. ) Thirdly, running a simple unsupervised clustering either (k-means  or GMM initialized with k-means ) taking all precursor using the previous classification with their demographic information as parameters .   Now the recommendation system would be making recommendations to people who fall in the same final cluster.   I think this should solve the first use case. For model evaluation use the accuracy, but try reducing the false positives as that is much more dangerous business wise than false negatives.",True
