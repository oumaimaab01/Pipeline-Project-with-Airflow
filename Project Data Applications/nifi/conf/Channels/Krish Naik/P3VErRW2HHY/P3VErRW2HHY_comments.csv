@mandalorian1992,2024-03-16T14:57:28Z,0,"So the problem here is LLMs or LLM based models cannot attain AGL. DEVIN is just a work flow automation tool that is based over GPT 4. It says in their specifications that it can do about 13% of the work.  The main issue with these tools when competing with a human is as a follows:  1.) Ability to understand context of a larger problem along with assessing the technical/ business eco system surrounding a problem.  2.) These tools are stuck in a time snapshot while humans learn live on the go and learn from past experiences, future changes that can come and can customize the solution.  3.) The ability to blend - Humans can break down a problem into smaller pieces and find the best solution of those pieces and make a product by blending stuffs from these different sources to build something which is truly unique and tailored to their context. This is the toughest ability that is being explored right now.  Where tools like these shine is the ability to learn fast. We Human are slow to absorb and process information. This is a major disadvantage here.  So just like gpt this tool would do basic, repetitive stuff done very quickly and efficiently. So in near term, this is going to replace lazy programmers and also mediocre freshers for sure.  I would urge all to keep yourself updated, learn as much as you can. Happy learning. Cheers!",True

@thinkingmaniac54325,2024-03-15T17:46:01Z,1,"I like how this guy  is tellling the truth there are many code influencers on social media selling their courses telling that devin is not such a big deal the point they are entirely missing is that it can improve itself through feedback it will take atmost 1 year to train it in difficult tasks and finetune it to company specific needs we need to be more creative intutive and the typical norm of learing coding to just get the job will be gone we need to be more resourceful and should not solely dependent on coding for the job we should also learn other things like business,capital markets etc",True
@Space-791,2024-03-15T17:30:53Z,1,"AI wll never replace Human in 100%. They tried to create AI in order to replace animators but it didnt work. A human animator is still very creative and can make things the way a customer wants it. AI animation is limited. The same with Software engineering, AI will jst be a tool Software engineers will use to make the job easier but it cannot replace them. üòÖwow. Stop freaking people out with your opinion.",True
