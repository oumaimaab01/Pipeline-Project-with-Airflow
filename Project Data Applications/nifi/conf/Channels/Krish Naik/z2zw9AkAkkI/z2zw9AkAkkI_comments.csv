Subscription is kind of investment rather than expense.. Most of the people doesn't make that wise decision to subscribe the channel.The psychology of a viewer with more subscribed channel is that they think 'hmm...This channel is already got 1M subscriber..So it will not affected by my subscription..'  The second thing I want to mention that don't be hurt by the words..When you are doing something new some people is going to criticize you.. My suggestion is that please listen to them and then think that if you were really wrong or not?If you are wrong try to learn from it otherwise smile and move on..Yes, sometimes it is difficult..If you can tackle these situations you will be more peaceful and more wiser..

@achyutpsd,2020-05-04T02:34:03Z,0,"Hi Krish, Thanks for sharing the analytics. You have done a fabulous job to share your knowledge to the community with immense hard work.  I have shared your channel and recommended to subscribe to all of my friends who want to start learning machine learning. But I dislike this video because for me you are expressing too much of emotions on the dislikes which is not required and it might discourage a budding YouTuber . That's my personal opinion. You have created a  massive impact for those who teach machine learning with very huge cost. So these kind of complaints dislikes are common and it cannot be avoided even if you uploaded another 10 videos to justify or convince those who dislike.  There is nothing wrong in honestly expressing what you feel but in a public medium, people should get inspired to become stronger by seeing how you overcome your obstacles with a positive mind set and motivation you give. For me you are bowing too much in this particular video.  So be strong , keep moving. First time I am disliking your video with a constructive feedback.   Cheers, Achyut",True
