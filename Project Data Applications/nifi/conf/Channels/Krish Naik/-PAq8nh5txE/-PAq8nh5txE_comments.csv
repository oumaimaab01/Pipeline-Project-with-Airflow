@chetanshukla768,2024-02-19T11:36:51Z,1,"Start saving and investing 50-60% salary from day 1. No excuses. Not everyone in IT is gifted to climb the corporate ladder or switch every 1-2 years. There are many mediocre workers as well and there is absolutely no shame in it. We have unfortunately created an environment where a resource meeting expectations at work is looked down upon and expected to give something EXTRA at work for minimal hike and respect. Upskill (either in IT or some other field) and try hard to create an alternate source of income. In the end, it is not your job but the money in your bank account that counts.",True
