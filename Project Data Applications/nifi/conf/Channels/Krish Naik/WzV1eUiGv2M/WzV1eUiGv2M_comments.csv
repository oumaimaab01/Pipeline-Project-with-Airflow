@abhi9029,2024-04-08T07:08:43Z,0,This is nearly same as preparing for government exams. Lots and lots of preparation. And when you get in the company still there will be a lot of work and again learning new technology requires a lot of focus. When you age it's difficult to keep on focusing on different technologies and learn new things. So don't think that once you ge that job it's done. It's not just it's just a beginning.,True
