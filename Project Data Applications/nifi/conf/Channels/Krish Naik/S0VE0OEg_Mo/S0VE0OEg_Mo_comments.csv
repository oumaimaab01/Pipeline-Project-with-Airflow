I am currently a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science (CSE). My primary goal is to slowly learn data science so that after graduation, I can secure a job or pursue a master's degree in Data Science. Job prospects will become relevant to me in about 2 or 2.5 years. Should I follow this list entirely, or should I skip some parts of it, such as job-related questions and topics? Thank you for your amazing work.",True
