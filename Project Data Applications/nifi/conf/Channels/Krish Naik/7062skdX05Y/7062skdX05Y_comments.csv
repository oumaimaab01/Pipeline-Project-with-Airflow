I believe we cannot calculate the number of K as you have done it bcoz we mostly just choose a suitable number. If am wrong plz bring me back on track. I believe what you were trying to check is the portion size of each partition in a fold, that can be calculated using the size of the train_test split which i bliv in the example you used is 80%20% therefore using the 1000 records  ->1000 of 20% =200 in each partition of a fold then the K we choose it to our preference.

@harrywadhwa1395,2021-11-08T16:00:00Z,0,I have a doubt. For Leave one out cv technique how come we attain the low bias condition ?  If the model is in production and new test data is introduced it would yield lesser accuracy which means model is over fitting that is because of high variance in test and low bias in train. So shouldn't this be high variance since we're taking the generalisation error into picture.,True
