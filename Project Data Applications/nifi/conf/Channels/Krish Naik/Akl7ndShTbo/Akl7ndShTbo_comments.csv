@balive053,2022-01-10T07:09:24Z,21,"Hey Krish. I wanted to give you some feedback/ideas for the way you present these in the future. You obviously have an enormous knowledge of the data science sphere and provide a good roadmap to learning it. In practice, I haven't seen jobs which uses all of the data science skillset. From my experience you could divide DS jobs into several main categories with each of these needing a portion of the skills. For example:  1) In finance - they mostly use data scientists as analysts and focus on visualization skills. Almost no ML etc. needed.  2) In testing/research - the skill set needed is mostly based on the stats side, A/B testing etc.  3) In your ""model building"" roles - this is where the really cool parts of DS come in where you need ML, maybe CV, deep learning etc.  4) ML Dev side - More of a software developer who needs to know about building models in software, maybe towards deployment on the ML Engineer side too. For new people looking to get into it and worried about learning all of this, maybe you can divide it by ""what type of data scientist they want to be"" rather than a road map to learning everything. It would seem less overwhelming and prepare them well for the job they'll get. Thanks for another great video!",True
