@vijaykrishnamenon,2022-12-26T01:38:37Z,0,"DS is not just an overlap. DS is the superset of all. ML and DL are all data driven techniques. Right now we have very little AI that does not run on data driven techniques. So DS encompasses all that. Hmm may be AI can have a part outside DS in future like pure exploratory and conditional algorithms (which we don't have as of now) that does not strictly com under the DS set.¬†I rather see them not as subsets at all AI is rightly just writing smart programs, and ML is seen as the Enabling technology, ML has an issue with feature engineering so DL is seen as a enabler interns of automating that. ML and DL have a clear subset relationship, where as contemporary DS is a practiced profession like a set of best practices. I always used a triangular hierarchy diagram so I can be a bit vague when it comes to a subset relation. AI is engineering and programming, ML and DL is Stat and Math (though implementation uses programming), DS is a set of best practices that includes Math, Stat, computer sc. and domain knowledge. We are in the age of data ('driven') solution rather than just another software solution, some thing I do a lot to live.   I ve been teaching AI ML DL and DS for the last 12 yrs at least and now I am a principal data scientist in a respectable company. I have a masters in Software egg and applied sc, another masters in Computational engineering and a PhD in Mathematical Linguistics, with almost 2 decades of experience in the data Space... Gave the credentials so I hope you'll take my advice seriously...   But overall good presentation.",True

I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec.

@ExCeLlEnCe.aTtRaCtIoN,2020-11-29T17:43:38Z,0,"Hello!  Think about it.  In the coming future days, humans life will be fully based on AI Technology.  Internally machines will work on behalf of human and will make their work very accurate and more easier.  Machines will work continuously and will generate money day by day for you.  This all will be becoming true in the coming future days.  Believe or not. Again, it's all up to your choice.  So, that's why, those who have already participated as a *Primary Founder* have already secured their own life as well.   They all will get automated residual income through AI Technology even if there are no further participations as a Customer after launching on coming next month of Dec '20.  Now, their residual income won't be stop even if they all sitting idle at home.  Due to such reasons, that will makes this project very real and magical in the coming future days.  Wait and watch!   All corporate professionals will also get benefits from such AI Technology based project.  So, if you wish, you may also grab this opportunity today itself.  It's because, if once the position for becoming Primary Founder gets lock, you won't be able to become Primary Founder again.  Finally then, you will only have to participate as a Customer after company's launch which is expected before the end of Dec '20.  So once again, to become Primary Founder or to become Customer or none of this, that's all up to your choice.  But remember, this kind of AI Technology based opportunity will never comes for you again.  Your little bit incorrect decisions may gives you great loss in the later time.  Hope you agreed!  https://trimurl.co/T9g2y1a    Regards,  GoFounder Team",True

But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information. Now If I tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how I could knew about this subject. Thanking your Sir once again.

ANN like MLP with one hidden layer is not deep learning, but a ML algorithm. Deep learning are ANNs based algorithms with multiple hidden layers / multiple layers, that's why it is deep, and usually used with huge datasets (CNN and RNN are good examples as explained in the video).  Transfer Learning can be done with a simple ANN (MLP), not only with CNN. Good Video!",True

@whats_up_winnie,2019-12-09T13:02:03Z,4,"Hi Sir, Firstly thankyou your video was informative as well as short.  I needed your suggestion in making a decision regarding my Master's, it would be a great help to me.   So, I am planning to do Master's In year 2020 and currently i am in my 8th semester of btech.   The Problem is that i have confusion in choosing a specialisation for my Master's i.e. if i should do Master's in AI or Master's in DATA SCIENCE(DS)  I had AI as a subject in my Bachelor's so i have studied that & found interest in it, but i haven't studied DS in particular( but had a thought of Choosing it for Master's because, Reason 1: I had a Subject DBMS(Database Management System) as a subject in my btech 4th sem and i liked  that that time, So i thought to go for Data Science, thinking this would involve work with data, But For the confirmation i tried to study about Data Science(from Udemy online course on Hadoop) and came to know that it involves stats and other Mathematics ( which is the problem, i don't like maths much), Reason 2: It has a good Job Market i.e. DS  Also, Not Choosing AI for my master's is (Second Thoughts i mean) it is still a narrow field and doesnot have a huge Job Market (this is what i have came to know/think right now)  I needed advice from someone Who have worked in these Fields, because they would advice me the best this is why i have dropped my query here.   P.S. : It would help me a lot,   Also if you don't mind please provide me your email id so that i can talk to you in person(i would not take your much time),  Sorry For the lengthy Message Thankyou In Advance üòä",True
