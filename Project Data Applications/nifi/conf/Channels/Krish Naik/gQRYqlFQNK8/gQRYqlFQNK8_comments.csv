@christbryannokamfotso3252,2024-04-16T07:56:37Z,0,"Thanks for this explanation you just gave.  I am a student leveraging skills in data science and since i know that EDA takes alot of time while being done manually, i would like to automate the process. I searched the different ways of doing it and i saw several types of libraries but yet the outcome doesnot totally satisfy my needs.  I would like to perform the automate EDA and for the outcome, i wish that if first of all display a univariate analysis graphs and next a multivariate analysis graphs cause i wish to display specifi graphs for both analysis. My questions are:   1. Is it possible to modify those libraries to actually display the outcome i wish? If yes how please?  2. If it is not possible, guess i will have to do it from scratch. So do you please give me guidlines on how i can do it?  If not necessary going from scrtach, if you have ideas please ket me know.  Thanks",True
