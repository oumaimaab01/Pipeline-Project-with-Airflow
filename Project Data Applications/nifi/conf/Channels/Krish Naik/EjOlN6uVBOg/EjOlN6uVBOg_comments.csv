@_seeker423,2022-12-05T02:21:25Z,2,Content based filtering as the name goes only looks at content for which the user has provided explicit/implicit feedback and the recommender tries to find similar content to recommend. (there is no other user involved)  I think you mixed up collaborative filtering with content based filtering.,True

@SergoSS79,2021-01-08T16:05:46Z,9,"Hi Krish. Nice video. Two questions:  1. as I understood the Content Based Filtering do not require a User 2. Basically it works within one user, analyse what he/she likes and tries to find movies with similar characteristics/ganre/actors/etc. Right? 2. is it possible to combine those two methods? If yes, how whould it look like? Which method will be used at first and how it will be adjusted with second? or at the same time?",True

@beizhou2488,2019-08-20T12:43:32Z,12,"This tutorial is so nice. Thank you. I want to do a summary here based on what I have learned. Content-Based Filtering is built upon the attribute of movies(like genres, overview, etc.) and no user-generated data is involved. Collaborative Filtering is based on user behaviors, to be specific, which is to recommend movies based on the rating of users. I am not sure what I understood is right or not. Please correct me if you find any errors, please, which will help me a lot. Thank you very much.",True
