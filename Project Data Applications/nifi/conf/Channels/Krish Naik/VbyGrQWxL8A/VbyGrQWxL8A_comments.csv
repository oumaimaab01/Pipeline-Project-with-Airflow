@Edw590,2021-03-24T00:36:54Z,0,"Thanks for the video! A question though: is there anything PyCharm Professional doesn't have that Spyder has that would help in Data Science? I was recommended to use Spyder, but I love PyCharm and all its features. I'm unsure if which one to use.... I've seen the variable explorer inside PyCharm already, and also a weird (but existing) Jupyter Notebook support inside it too. Not sure if there are other things that make Spyder better than PyCharm in Data Science?",True
@mehrdadanvar8518,2020-11-01T14:26:57Z,0,"God knows how good you are :-). one suggestion, for your next videos please consider talking a little bit about the flexibility of the IDE in writing code in languages other than python. you know how perfect R-studio is for writing R code, but when it comes to other languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, R-studio simply does not look write or feel write. One of the greatest features in R-studio is the availability of viewing the variables we create while coding and inspecting them (calling them) easily without having to run the entire notebook. Again thank you for the great discussion. Another thing, dealing with paths is killing me in R, and since I am new to python, It will also be a problem for me !!!",True
