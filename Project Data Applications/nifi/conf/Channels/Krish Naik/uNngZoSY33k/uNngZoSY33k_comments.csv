@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-18T17:32:36Z,10,"I like how you pointed out that Data Science is not about building models, it's about using various skills and various tools to solve problems. Anyone who is willing to learn these tools and skills can become a data scientist. üòä Recently, at MLConf2019, Franziska Bell from Uber gave a talk about how Uber does data science. One of the things she said was that Uber was making it possible for any of its employees to do data science related work.  Nowadays, it's important for all of us to be data savvy. Smart companies know that, and they are looking for creative, hard working problem solvers. There is a lot of opportunity for those who want to work as part of data science teams. üòä",True
