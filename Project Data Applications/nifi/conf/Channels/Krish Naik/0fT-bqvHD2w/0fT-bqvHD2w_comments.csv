@pankaj3856,2020-03-28T17:52:00Z,0,Did you intentionally skip the one hot encoding or the categorical data handling?,True
@rajeshwarsehdev2318,2020-03-14T06:53:33Z,0,"Why are we taking mean in below code ? for feature in categorical_features:     labels_ordered=dataset.groupby([feature])['SalePrice'].mean().sort_values().index     labels_ordered={k:i for i,k in enumerate(labels_ordered,0)}     dataset[feature]=dataset[feature].map(labels_ordered)",True
@bharathjc4700,2020-02-23T08:45:53Z,0,how to update new data for a model which is running in production?,True
@Researchyard,2020-02-17T10:28:47Z,1,do you have any examples for stock market prediction?,True
@MrSawan27,2020-02-14T01:16:01Z,0,"Krish, I checked your code for converting categorical features into  numeric using mean SalePrice for that category. My question is how can we do the same for test data since we do not have the SalePrice available there?",True
@do_it8459,2020-02-10T13:29:25Z,3,"Great work. In the video, I didn't understand how you encoded all the categorical data types into numerical.  And I cannot fit the data in MinMaxScaler,  as it contains so much categorical data.  Thank you",True
@ManishKumar-qs1fm,2020-02-08T13:55:36Z,2,Why u r choose only 4 or 5  feature for log transformation ??,True
@puliraju9222,2020-02-08T03:09:08Z,1,Great stuff sir.Tq,True
@omkarpatil2854,2020-02-07T15:07:00Z,0,"Hello , there were many numerical features were skewed, why we are only log normalising 5 of them?",True
@RahulGupta-kd1cn,2020-02-07T07:25:51Z,1,I have one general question that line comprehension code (little complex to understand ) faster than the simple line of code?  if the answer is yes then please explain to me why? if the answer is no (both having the same time of execution )  Why using line comprehension?,True
@MrSawan27,2020-02-06T18:24:15Z,5,"Nice video Krish. One thing I would like to point out is while scaling, we need to exclude the categorical features otherwise the code will throw an error.  Also we did not handle outliers in Feature Engineering. Is it not necessary if we have applied log transformation?",True
@bharathjc4700,2020-02-06T18:08:27Z,3,"great video !!! Hi Sir, what statistical tests should we perform as soon we get the data",True
@piyushsharma-mh9yr,2020-02-06T17:49:37Z,1,"Hi Krish, Thanks for making and sharing these nice tutorials. Please let me know if newly created numerical_nan features are just to do data analysis or  we are going to use those in model training as this approach i have seen first time and is very interesting.",True
@soumendradash5979,2020-02-06T17:08:42Z,2,Why scale the categorical features?,True
@pratyushcavutur5388,2020-02-06T16:47:54Z,1,Won't there be a leakage issue if we transform the entire Dataset? Shouldn't we first scale the Train data and then use the same Scaler on the Test Data Set?,True
@bharathpreetham2840,2020-02-06T15:48:53Z,2,why cant we do normalisation in feature scaling this case??,True
@ranjan4495,2020-02-06T15:39:42Z,2,Thankyou sir.,True
