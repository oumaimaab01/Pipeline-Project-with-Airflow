@vaidik_krishna,2022-05-11T12:57:02Z,0,"The challenges for MERN are more than challenges and like a full fledged application development. Every challenge takes a minimum one month to build, especially learning the course first time and doing a single challenge is almost impossible within a month. It is like teaching ABC and asking to write a book as a book also contains nothing but ABC. I am not being critical here just saying the complexity of challenges. Those who are serious and full time on this course can do max one or (two??)challenges. May be the challenges are kept tough to keep non serious folks out of challenge.",True
