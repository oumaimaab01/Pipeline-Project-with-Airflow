@bennguyen1313,2021-02-19T05:06:03Z,1,"I'd like to improve my python's application performance, by passing a Multiprocessing pipe when instantiating the PyQt widget.     One way I thought of doing is to create a custom class that extends both a pyqt widget and multiprocessing.  For example this inherits from ONLY Qt, class MainWindowReceiver(QtWidgets.QMainWindow): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super(MainWindowReceiver, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)  And can be instantiated without passing any argument: main = MainWindowReceiver() main.show()  However, if I create a class that inherits from both PyQt AND multiprocessing, class MainWindowReceiver(QtWidgets.QMainWindow ,  mp.Process): super(Process, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)  then NONE of these work: out_pipe = mp.Pipe() p1 = MainWindowReceiver(out_pipe) #doesn't work p1 = MainWindowReceiver(pipe=out_pipe) #doesn't work p1 = MainWindowReceiver(,pipe=out_pipe) #doesn't work p1.show()  1) What does the syntax look like to construct a class that inherits from both PyQt & multiprocessing, such that instantiation its object, only requires the pipe argument?    2) Is there a way to pass a pipe to a PyQt Widget WITHOUT creating a multiple-inherited class?",True
@sachinkun21,2021-01-30T07:54:24Z,2,"@krish great video as always. I have a couple of questions, when you set Max workers to None, did it automatically spawn max possible threads as the execution got completed in approx 1 sec?  Also in case of multiple workers how can we map the result output back to it's function call as different function may have different execution times.",True
