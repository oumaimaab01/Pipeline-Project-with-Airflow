@siddhantkolkar3022,2021-09-21T12:19:14Z,2,Hey bro Appreciate your efforts for putting this out and the efforts you put to make the video  But I guess it's not a proper advice your sharing here.. Basically you are sharing the 90% comman people mindset and eventually that's the reason the world is in a rat race.. We can leave a job with no plan Saving more before quiting is important to survive but other advices were like as there is competition so don't try only or just basic society advice   And you contradict yourself.. not all are promoted as well And quality competition is not more  Non Quality competition has increased And  Even the person is lazy and still not ready to work hard ..it's okayy.. because that person will realize one day  And they will change from within and that will make them successful  And if they don't  They were eventually gonna end up there,True

@jaim6831,2021-02-16T05:58:06Z,20,"I don't know how youtube suggested me when I was in same dilemma .. I resigned from top no1 service based MNC in October 2020 with no offer in hand and with  90days of NP because of the work pressure and not satisfying with work and pay. Every one was like Are you mad , you quitting the job in the pandemic. Everyone is loosing their jobs and here you are with so much over confidence and you are leaving the job in one of the TOP MNC. I heard a lot and lot of stuff like this. First 2 months were so hard for me as I was not able to crack a single interview and I was so depressed and decided to take back my resignation but in deep inside I really don't want to  because I felt it's like a hell. When I'm just having another 20days left in my notice period, I relaised I made lot of mistakes in my interviews( I watched mock interviews)and after that I cracked 3 interviews and I have 3offers in my hand with good package . All I want to say is just belive in yourself. Because you only know what you are and what you are capable of . Don't believe in others,  of course they are your well wishers. But I just want to say never give up. It will take time but you will get it .",True

@vahiagyat,2021-01-07T20:07:25Z,14,"I agree with the basic message Krish wanted to give but everyone walks in differents shoes - we can't understand what he/she might be going! So, we shouldn't be mentioning a hard and fast criterion ""don't quit your job"". Already, we middle-class people are so much risk-averse (of course there are reasons for being that way - usually we don't have financial safety net), but this thinking has killed so many dreams and sent so many people in depression! I am not saying just wake up one day and quit your job and neither I am saying you should never quit your job - you are the best person to judge what's right. But yes do make the decision with a calm mind thinking about all pros and cons. Also, age plays a very important part in this decision - in your early 20's you don't have that many responsibilities (most of the people), so your view will be very different compared to someone close to 40 with a family to support.  Anyway, there can be certain scenarios in life where you may have to quit your job or maybe you can lose your job - in covid many people did! So, for this one - there are few golden rules of savings and investments (shared by prominent investment bankers). I will not go in details but the summary is * When you get in a job, start saving and save a minimum of 6 months of salary - preferable 12 months. * If you have a loan then, make sure to add EMI for 6 months in your savings - preferable 9-12 months. * Never allow a loan EMI to go above 30% of your total take-home (I know in India, it's not always possible but the idea is to keep it low). * Have a secondary source of income - there can be multiple ways.  If we maintain this kind of safety net then we can take the risk of quitting the job depending upon the ""why"" we want to quit. Rather than saying don't quit - I will say make the safety net then quit.  Now coming to the point quitting for govt. job or a startup etc. I would frame all this as one point - quitting to fulfill your dreams! It's trued not everyone who quits the job gets into UPSC or their startups become the next unicorns BUT even if they fail in that they can come back to the normal jobs - isn't it? But if they never tried for their dream, they will repent this for their whole life. So, I feel if you are sure about what you want to do and you have done the homework - it's worth giving a shot! Yes, definitely use your brain - don't waste all 6 years in the ego that I will UPSC only! or don't just into startups without having proper homework done - having an idea is one thing to have a startup is completely another thing!  Yes, many people do prepare for govt job in parallel with their day job but as I said everyone is unique - if you feel you can't then please don't just keep trying because some other person did it! This applies for MBA prep too - personally, I didn't and I feel one can easily manage prep along with day job but then one of my close relative felt that he couldn't do that along with his current job (he was a mech engineer and frustrated at his job too). Everyone told him not to quit but he researched and discussed with many people what are pros and cons and finally he did quit and did an MBA and just last month he got an extremely good package in one of the companies from  FAANG. So, it's just being how clear and determined you are.  All the above things are one category where you want to leave for some other thing, there is another category you don't want to leave for another thing - it's just that you not happy here. Now, it depends, how unhappy you are! I have seen people getting too much agitated even on the small thing - if a manager scolded then I will quit. If the current project is not as per liking I will quit. I feel one should become mature and learn the corporate culture. If you are getting scolded for the wrong reason or you are not getting your due then there are ways to handle these diplomatically. If even that doesn't work and you have tried anything then yes go ahead quit - but get a job first. Don't quit in the heat of the moment.  Another important reason can be harassment - then don't quit, be bold enough to complain. And in the worst-case scenario, if that doesn't help and it's impacting your mental health or physically - then definitely do quit. But don't let those people walk away just like that. For mental harassment due to excessive work or calling at any time - I feel, we are responsible for it in some way, in starting we let it go thinking okay will do this time - it's urgent or whatever. Then it becomes a habit. And we Indians, have been very wrongly trained to NOT say NO to people!!! I have struggled myself!  BE upfront and say NO (yes don't be completely inconsiderate either).   So, I feel - we shouldn't convey the message don't quit the job instead we should spread the message build a financial safety net so that if the time comes you can easily quit; be upfront and clear in drawing boundaries at work - learn to say NO and create work-life balance. We should focus on the root causes - quitting the job is NOT a big big deal that's part and parcel of life especially for people working in private companies! Govt job is a different scene, you join and then you leave only post-retirement. In the IT field or any private job, you have to quit one job to move onto the next better opportunity.   Remember: Job is a part of your life NOT YOUR LIFE itself! Even without a job - friends and family can support you and they will be there. But if you lose friends and family just because of the job then ..........................  P.S: One topic came in - quitting for higher studies. Please do investigate and analyze the ROI. Especially for people looking for MBA from outside - it's a huge investment! And given the current situation future is not that clear at least for middle management jobs.  P.S: sometimes we have to put paper and then look for a job, not necessarily because we didn't plan but it's easier to get a job in the notice period. And also under this kind of pressure, many people perform better because now they don't have the safety net otherwise many times people don't put their 100% in looking for a job because they are comfortable in their current company.",True

Yes I agree with the fact that we need to make sure we have a financial backup. But one should not suffer or sacrifice anything for a damn job and no point in staying in that job as well. In my opinion if you don't have a financial backup save some money, try to get into another job or give yourself a break for at least a month to recover from this nightmare and then search for a job. There is literally no harm I repeat no harm in giving some time for yourself and I believe each and every damn company ""must"" thoroughly understand the real meaning of work-life balance so that this shit doesn't happen with anyone else.",True
