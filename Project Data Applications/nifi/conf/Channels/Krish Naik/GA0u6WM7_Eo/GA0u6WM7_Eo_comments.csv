One small suggestion, when you talked about the index(value,startIndex,stopIndex) method, you missed out on specifying one important point: When all the three parameters are mentioned in index(value,startIndex,stopIndex),the list searches for the element with the given value from startIndex to stopIndex-1 my_list=[1,2,3,4,1] my_list.index(1,1,4) -> this returns the error 1 not in the list  my_list.index(1,1,5) -> this correctly returns 4 It will be helpful for every one if you can emphasize on this assumption.Thanks",True
