@rajmeetsingh1625,2023-03-08T17:23:54Z,0,how to find computational complexity for DDPG algorithm ?,True
@kamran_desu,2022-03-05T00:31:34Z,0,"KNN training time is correctly NA here, it is a lazy classifier - O(1). It only predicts at run time by calculating distance to nearest neighbours. It's too computationally intensive O(n.d) if applied in a naive way, so need to use kd-tree / ball tree / apply dimensionality reduction.",True
@alessandrorossi1294,2021-05-20T20:10:29Z,0,"Nice job, the document you shared on screen was very helpful",True
@rsinh3792,2021-04-28T12:37:46Z,0,"Sir reviewer of the manuscript asked me this question ""Please compare your proposed machine learning model with other based method in term of time complexity? Calculate the time complexity of your algorithm"", Can you please help me how to address this question?",True
@lefteriscipis9910,2021-04-24T08:25:27Z,0,some reference from where you got the computational complexity of algorithms?,True
@Steve-3P0,2021-04-23T00:20:19Z,0,"OK, so this is awesome 😎, but can you next drill down into the time complexity of training the various CNN, RNN, Transformer models for 1 epoch?",True
@Steve-3P0,2021-04-23T00:13:38Z,0,"If you set the video speed to .5, this video is digestible.",True
@anuragpatil3820,2020-07-17T14:42:49Z,1,"I read some articles on this . For linear regression,  the time complexity of this algorithm is computed on the basis of Normal Equation. Please correct me if am wrong",True
@ArunYadav-lf4ti,2020-03-22T17:15:08Z,1,"Thanks krish for this great information....So I want to create a list of algorithms on the basis of time taken to train, test and predict on particular problem. But I am confused how to start it...Plz guide me",True
