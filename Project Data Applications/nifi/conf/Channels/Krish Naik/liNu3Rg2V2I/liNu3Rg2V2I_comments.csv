@raj-nq8ke,2021-11-04T12:25:52Z,0,My suggestions: Everyone knows their will be cheating in quizes. So what you can do is give us some dataset(preprocessed or not) 2-3 days before conducting youtube live  and we have to com up with the solutions(classification/predictions/image processing/ data vizualization). and you select those with unique methods and better accuracy and discuss their solutions live. In this way everyone will know how others approach to the problems. You can do same competition for 3-4 times and then choose the winners. You can gift them free ineuron courses/tshirts or hoodies/swags. It will be a win win situation for everyone. For the easy part you can begin with CNN applications. Those 3-4 days will give us time to study those topics too.,True

@mallugopishankarreddy3807,2021-11-04T07:45:06Z,18,"Here is my idea for example take a real world   business problem ( not a kaggle dataset) provide the data . Amd divide the competition in to several parts. Day 1 (1.5 to 2 hours)  . Data quality check Where the competitor have to prepare the presentation about the quality of data and approaches that he wants to proceed to clean up the data the presentation needs to be short and simple not more than 4 slides.  Day 2. EDA :-  competitor have to do clean the data missing values , outliers, imbalance , categorical values (one hot encoding) data visualization , future engineering . And again he have to do the presentation about the insights of that data with plots and his assumptions and top predictors and why he that they are top predictors and model building approach. And why he have to use that model etc.  Day 3. Model building and hyper parameter tuning,Testing and evaluation. The marks should allot to every task suppose he did eda well so he got higher marks and he failed to do hyperparameter tuning so (less marks)  The final marks are average of 3 days marks .  Top performer will get reward amount . And for remaining persons Ineuron virtual internship + swags (tshirt,cap,bag pack,...  All should be Ineuron).   *Note*:- give importance to presentation skills than programming. Because everyone can access the Google and copy the syntaxes.. Competition name Ineuron Weekathon the competition should go for 1 week.  @krish  sir please reply if you like. My idea...",True

@girishksahu,2021-11-04T07:31:16Z,0,"Great initiative Krish and you are the ultimate inspiration on exploring and learning Data Science and AI in YouTube world.  Here are few suggestions:  1. Mock interview is great platform to get feedback for participants and also learn from it. It can be extended to cover different areas in Data Science with different types of role required in Data Science field.   2. Mock Presentation by participants where they can showcase what they did in project and basically kind of storytelling which is very critical part for success of Data Science projects.   3. Mock demo by participants where they can do quick demo of certain technology/framework used in Data Science field and demonstrate their expertise during live session.  Wish you safe and happy Diwali.  Cheers, Girish",True
