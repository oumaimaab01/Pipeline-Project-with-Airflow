@somnathbanerjee2057,2020-06-01T04:07:19Z,0,"Hi, here I have a little concern. I don't want to argue with your thought-process. But whatever you are telling about model deployment and see how it works on real-world problems, that productization process is everywhere. We do that integration in our day-to-day learning, art, science, technology and other domains. But, for every task, it should have a specific team in Data Science life-cycle. If you compare NYC-DataScience program and any of our present DataScience post-graduate program in India, you would find only 50-60% has been covered in the curriculum compared to NYC. Nevertheless, my UpDegree teacher taught us my ""Big Data Engineer"" friend will do that(Deployment and API related) task. You just need to aware of the whole process. Even my own training institute didn't teach us the model deployment part. Their students are getting jobs. Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Report Analysis and Visualization, Quantitative Analyst, Statistician everybody has a different task. So, the more it is getting complex to understand our individual responsibility the more vulnerable it would be to sustain the natural pattern of evolution. It would less vulnerable with its simplicity. For example, SAP technology. It would no longer exist within a decade of technological transformation. If you are talking about rapid transformation, then industries would provide that knowledge and skillset post-hiring as per their requirements. After all, employees are considered as an asset for the company. I would be grateful for your clarification. Thank you.

@ltoco4415,2020-05-27T04:35:45Z,2,"Rightly said sir. Data science is a technique which can be applied to any domain. It can be a part of a mobile app which would give suggestions using the ML/DL model.  And this kind of explanation was needed rather than the misleading articles on medium like ""Don't become a data scientist"". They put such misleading titles just to attract audiences. When an aspiring data scientists sees such title he will for sure open the article and the writer gets a view.   Thank you sir for clearing explaining how the things are at ground zero.",True

@rahulkhanna5423,2020-05-26T16:44:40Z,0,"Krish bro, do you even know what you are doing? Docker, kubernetes is a part of Devops, similarly software engineering is for creating applications for business, and Data Science is about crunching data and creating models, it's a pure math domain. You are saying a person should learn all the skills of 3 different jobs and work as a full fledged software engineer. Are you out of your mind? IT companies will pay these guys the same money even after learning all these skills and ultimately it will be a new normal. You are just devaluing the job of Software engineer and Devops engineer. You have 168k subscribers so lot of blood sucking startup ceo's will be watching your videos. Atleast understand. If you know all the skills it's okay but don't start a stupid trend and destroy jobs.",True
