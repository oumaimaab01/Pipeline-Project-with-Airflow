@gtMLAI,2023-07-12T12:45:56Z,1,"So just giving a CSV file, ChatGPT is able to infer all details about what each feature represents? Lol  ITS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF DATA LEAK.  GPT has trained on enormous amount of data (including this bike rentals data). So obviuosy it has mugged it up all.   But this doesnt means GPT is less capable. GPT works best on repetitive test.  Any data scientist/ML engineer can write script which when provided with the data, it will easily perform repetitive taks of data science workflow.  So ChatGPT is at best a productivity enhancer not a replacement.",True
