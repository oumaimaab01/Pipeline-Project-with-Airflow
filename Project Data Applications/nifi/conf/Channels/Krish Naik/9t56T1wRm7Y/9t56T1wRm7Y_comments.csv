@vahiagyat,2022-02-23T13:14:47Z,12,"Appreciate the work BUT this resume will NOT work in many of the companies. Most of the companies look for STAR format. And keep the roles/responsibilities to a minimum and focus on the work done - problem statement and its impact.  I feel that's a very important piece missing in this resume. None of the things have been quantified - even qualitatively no impact is mentioned as far as I can see. I know startups and a few companies are okay with this format but still, it's NOT an industry-accepted format at least as of now..  This is just a suggestion as this will help anyone who is looking to this video to make resume - please add STAR format (or any format which is crisp and shows the problem at hand and/or impact of your work)",True

@benherbener729,2021-11-27T18:35:06Z,3,"Pretty good resume, however, its missing one critical aspect.  Many engineering companies are wanting to quantify an applicants value, so, it often helps to include this in as many places as possible.  This often looks like a ""$xx cost-savings...""  Or ""xx defects captured..."", but can really be virtually anything as long as it conveys ""by what quantifiable metric did you help the company or project in question?""",True
