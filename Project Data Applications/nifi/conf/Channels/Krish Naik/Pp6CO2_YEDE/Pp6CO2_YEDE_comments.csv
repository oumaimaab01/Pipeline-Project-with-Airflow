You are given 5 input features and the model that you have built is a fully-connected feedforward network having 2 hidden layer with 4 neurons each. The output layer uses softmax activation function.  How many parameters needed in the output layer (second hidden layer to output layer) ?  options: 12,15,16,20 Can anyone help out with explanation?",True
@jeekakrishna,2022-08-30T02:04:32Z,1,"i was a maths genius since childhood in the leagues of ramanujan amd aryabhatta. i will tell you why, because i failed in all subjects except maths till class 8th. But in maths i uses to get 100 out of 100 every year all classes all exams. When i grew up , my love for maths only became better and better. For me now maths is almost boring and i study vedic maths and implementation of this in Physics and Computers...so yeah maths made me inclined towards pursuing this data science... I want to make a good career in this field in upcoming decade.",True
