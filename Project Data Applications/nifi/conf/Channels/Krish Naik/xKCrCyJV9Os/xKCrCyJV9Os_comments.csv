@MeenalSoni-mx2rk,2024-05-22T15:18:23Z,0,"at the timestamp 22.07, we will not divide by 2, the value in z-table gives the area at left of the value so 1-0.99111 will give all the area to left of +2.307(which will include the area to the left of -2.307 too). Therefore no need to half, as the sum of both the areas + 0.9911 will be greater than 1, please notice that 2x0.008899 + 0.9111 = 1.008899, i.e., 0.0088 greater than 1, as we have added the shaded area to the left of mean twice.",True

Regarding this statistics video, at time 22:05 the value obtained from the ztable  (0.99111) covers the area from the zscore=2.307(in this example) to the left, therefore 1-0.99111 = 0.00889 cover the area from zscore to the right, therefore pvalue should be 2x0.00889.",True

My doubt is will the OneNeuron Subscribers also get the opportunity to enroll for live batches for the specific course just like 'Full Stack Data Science' or any other Course when the New Batch of that perticular Course starts? or do we need to buy that course separately for the live classes which will be held batch wise with limited capacity.
