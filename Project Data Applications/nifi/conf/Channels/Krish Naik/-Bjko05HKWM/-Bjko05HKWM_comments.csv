@somnathbanerjee2057,2021-01-05T08:12:07Z,0,"Hi Krish, could you please guide me how can I handle text column for a regression problem. It's not about encoding categorical features. But what I am looking for is---extracting some meaningful information from the existing column containing text data using string manipulation method from regex...Please recommend me an effective way of doing this.",True
@51kaushal,2021-01-05T06:11:39Z,0,"Kris, but what if we have a regression problem then we would not have output as 0/1, then how do we encode the categorical features like pincode, do we use frequency/count encoding in there??",True

@slowhanduchiha,2020-09-11T21:51:09Z,1,One Question Sir. I was working on a classification dataset. My out put variable is also categorical in nature . I applied OHE and later when i saw the heatmap it made no sense because the columns were bit blank. Correct me where i am wrong here,True

I have a doubt, at last part of the video .. while converting from categorical feature to numerical feature 2001 pincode represented at one instance as 1 and at other instance it is represented as 0 .. on what basis we represented like this ?",True

@swaruppanda2842,2019-10-08T16:46:07Z,1,At 17:08 u made it clear for 2001 as 1 as output will be 2/3=0.6 what about 2001 as 0 as output?,True

@parakhsrivastava7743,2019-06-23T16:43:24Z,1,"I have a doubt... When dealing with categorical values having many classes, you took all 2001's and find out the probability where O/P is 1. Suppose, that is coming 0.6(as in video). Now you are replacing all 2001's with 0.6, no matter O/P is 0 or 1... WHY?   Should we not replace 2001's by 0.6 only if O/P is 1, else replace it with 0.4?
