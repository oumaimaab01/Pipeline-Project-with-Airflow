@raghuram8645,2022-01-14T17:28:33Z,10,"Hi everyone.. I am requesting don't be so cheap and talk about fee reduction to 4000Rs, even if they do so,  you people will ask for 2000Rs.. its our mindset here definitely not the cost ..  you become rich by making best use of what they are providing at their best..   if you want to earn 10 lakhs per year , can't you pay 7k for what makes you a deserving professional earning over a lakh per month..   Literally I felt Krish should not be wasting his valuable time (even if it is a minute) in answering such pity questions even after fixing the price at the best reasonable affordable rate to every single job aspirant.. Unknowingly you are doing more harm by demotivating the startup who want to revolutionize the education sector providing best services at very affordable price to every one , literally everyone.. hence my friendly request to you all.. they will have to hire, work and support us 24√ó7, so how do they manage ?  Grow up my friends! Please take this in a positive way! I wish everyone all the best..",True
