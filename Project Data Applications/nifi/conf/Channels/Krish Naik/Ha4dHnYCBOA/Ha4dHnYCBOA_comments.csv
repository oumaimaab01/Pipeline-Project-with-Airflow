@archanakamathm,2021-12-28T03:42:19Z,0,Hello sir  My query is whether certificates are necessary to fill up the resume or portfolio. All courses ( I am planning to shift my career to data analyst) are extremely costly for me. I would learn from free courses and YouTube channels which don't promise certificates. Would just learning and application of the knowledge is enough?,True

@TheRockhar,2021-06-25T11:11:37Z,0,"HI sir, I am a career changer. An aeronautical engineer by background. Worked 3 years in manufacturing management. Found my passion in coding. Working since 1.5 years as an Integrations engineer implementing django and drf based solutions on daily basis. Have been studying AIML on my own. I have opted to benchmark my skills using the IABAC CAIE examination. Planning to clear it before this sept. M sure being from the industry IT has been a welcoming industry to outsiders as well. I understand the value of proving yourself once you are in front of an interviewer. The question here is, Does the certification, like the one I mentioned above, appeal enough to the interviewer to shortlist my profile given that I can showcase like 10-15 real world projects on my resume. Does the certification add to the value so the one can stand out while applying. I don't mean anything related to getting the job. I know getting the job is totally depended on ones ability to perform in an interview. To showcase ones skills. Does it help make my CV stand out as compared to others.",True
