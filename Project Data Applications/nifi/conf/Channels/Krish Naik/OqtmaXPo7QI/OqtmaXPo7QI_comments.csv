How would you deal with an optimization problem that asks you to find 20 points in space for placing objects in them, however, it is crucial to keep parameter ""x""  as close as possible to 10 units. A point to remember is changing one of the positions in space varies ""x"" for all the objects as well, so it wont be possible to keep ""x=10 units"" for all the objects, but at least need to be very close to it. Another condition is, a gap of at least 10 cm must be maintained between all points.   Can you point to any direction/any ML algorithm/optimization algorithm which might work for solving this problem? Thanks a lot.",True
