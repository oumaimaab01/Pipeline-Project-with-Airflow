I covered basic coding languages like C,C++ and DBMS in our curriculum.  I'm from 2014 batch and supposed to finish it in 2018.

Will I be able to get a job despite having 2 years gap?  2. How should I plan my learning path to achieve my goal?  3. How to get hands-on practice on real world data using free resources?  4.
