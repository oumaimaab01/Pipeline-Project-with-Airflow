@tejbhatt20,2021-03-11T18:25:35Z,5,One thing i would like to add is when you train your cnn model you need to add another category of class such as other because if you upload any other pic than plant disease then its gonna classify as disease only rather than detecting it as other cause proability values adds to 1 and cnn thinks the uploaded pic only belongs to the class category it was trained on.so keep this in mind while training the model otherwise it is a great project .,True
