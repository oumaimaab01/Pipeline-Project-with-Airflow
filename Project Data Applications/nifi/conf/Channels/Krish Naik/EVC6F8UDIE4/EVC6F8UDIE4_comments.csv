@aravinthmegnath3569,2023-02-25T03:32:38Z,3,1) Random Sampling technique - Where each and every person of the population will get the equal probability of getting selected. 2) Stratified sampling - First we will divide the population into many groups randomly and then we will do the random sampling. 3) Systematic sampling - First the grouping will be done based on some criteria and pick the kth member of the group and then keep selecting the kth member of the group. 4) Cluster sampling - If the location is involved then we can use this sampling technique. The map is divided into areas and then the people in that particular area is sampled. 5) Convenience sampling - Using data that are readily available 6) Multi stage sampling - Two or more other techniques are mixed together in this sampling.,True

@vaibhavpoliwal2820,2021-05-09T12:13:52Z,61,"There are mainly 4 types of Sampling that is useful: ( SIMPLE EXAMPLES)  Simple Random Sampling: In childhood, in cricket one person randomly choose number of batting position of every player while another person pointing out the number by hand backside of 1st person. This is called Simple Random Sampling.  Stratified random sample: In school prayer in the morning there is particular line for every class and different line for boys and girls, so here there are n groups of particular class student. And here if teacher chooses one boy from every class or one girl from every class, this is known as Stratified Random Sampling.  Cluster random sample: Assume in school suddenly one guest come and principal orderd every teacher to order all the students to come at playground. This is an immediate order so teacher and students can't make proper lines according to class wise. Here there can be or can't be students of different class are stood in one line. So here every line is called as Cluster. Now teacher order one student from every line, this is called Cluster Random Sampling.  Systematic random sample: Assume everyday in School assembly , teacher order students by their roll number, from every LINE(here it can be same as in Stratified or Cluster random Sampling). So take randomly from groups, after nth position, this type of sampling is known as Systematic Random Sampling.  Sir, let me know if I'm wrong at any point.
