@rahulvansh2390,2021-07-02T15:27:54Z,15,"A suggestion: There are very less opportunities for Machine learning engineer, data scientist, deep Learning engineer, ai engineer even though it's highly demanded. I highly recommend to focus on opening of such roles in good companies/ startups. Every youtubers are focusing on software engineering or sde roles openings, please give priority to such roles as well. Also please share interview experience of people who got such roles as a FRESHERS in good companies on campus or off campus.(Please mention salary as it'll be very helpful)  Thank you 😊🙏🏻",True
