@another_hindu,2021-05-12T00:47:11Z,2,"Hello sir, maybe I am here too late but I still hope that you would acknowledge this question as it might be of immense value. I have a disputed question which basically revolves around knn imputer, scaling and the concept of data leakage. As the knn imputer works on the principles same as knn algo, it does share the pros and cons of knn algo, right. So wont it be better to simply scale the data first ? Also, in case I am separating out the train and test data in order to avoid data leakage, should I split the data and then scale, impute ? Or should I impute and then split,scale it ? In case I split first...which is the most common preference which stats should I use for the user input. And lastly how should I handle the label encoded columns if any ? Nobody is discussing on this when it is one of the most imp problems a person would likely face. Can you please make a video on this ?",True
