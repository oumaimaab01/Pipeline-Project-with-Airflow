In that case, mean can manipulate our answer, whereas, median will tell us the range of salaries for this job. That is why, Median is preffered over mean",True

@sumitmohod7020,2021-08-20T11:11:23Z,0,"As mean, median & mode are measures of central tendency. Mean is best measure of central tendency as it covers entire data to generate mean. But in presence of outliers in data median is better measure of central tendency. Different companies may have different salaries for data analyst, bigger companies might have more salary, while smaller companies have smaller salaries and vise versa. Hence, we'll use here Median as measure of central tendency here because mean get affected due to presence of outliers in data.",True

@ktejakrishna9620,2021-07-21T09:01:49Z,0,"Mean is about the salary that most of the people are getting, where as median is all about the middlemost value. The number of people adds a weight age here in mean but not in median. Here is an example. Suppose out of 100 people, we have only 5 people getting salary < 5 LPA, and 95 people get above 5LPA. Then Mean of salary will be above 5 LPA. It will be inclined towards the range or group with more number of data subjects or data. But median, unlike mean is strictly the middle value irrespective of the number of data subjects. Median focus only on the salary amount here not the number of people. My analysis, Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere.",True
