Can you please suggest? I’m little tight on budget.  I was thinking of buying ideapad gaming 3 with i5-10300H Gtx 1650 8gb/512gb  But if there is something you can suggest with cheaper options or which processor to go with? i5 10th or 11th gen or AMD Ryzen 5",True

@lightning369,2022-04-02T04:19:38Z,0,"Krish Naik is so humble, friendly and outgoing. This is what makes a great man. He is awesomely resourceful with the much needed information in Data Science alongside other courses and an impactful visionary. His way of explaining things is awesomely on another level. Something in him draws one attention to what he is explaining. I believe iNeuron is a one-stop university for Data Science and will similarly be for other courses as the platform grows. . Keep up the good revolutionary work of educating humanity and changing lives, Krish Naik and the iNeuron Team.",True

@boringclasses8765,2022-03-31T17:24:08Z,0,"2. Say you are standing at the bottom of a staircase with a a dice. With each throw of the dice, you either move down one step (if you get a 1 or 2 on the dice) or move up one step (if you get a 3, 4 or 5 on the dice). If you throw a 6 on the dice, you throw the dice again and move up the staircase by the number you get on that second throw. Note if you are on the base of the staircase, you cannot move down! What is the probability that you will reach more than 60 steps after 250 throws of the dice. Change the code so that you have a function that takes as parameter, the number of throws. Add a new parameter to the function that takes a probability distribution over all outcomes from a dice throw. For example (0.2,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1) would suggest that the probability of getting a 1 is 0.2, 2 is 0.3 etc. How does that change the probability of reaching a step higher than 60?",True
