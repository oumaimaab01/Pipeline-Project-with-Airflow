@pjanjanam,2021-10-04T04:56:16Z,1,"A small comment at 17:35. I guess it is Derivative of J(m) over m. In other words, the rate of change of J(m) over a minute change of m. That gives us the slope at instantaneous points, especially for non linear curves when slope is not constant. At each point of ""m, J(m)"", Gradient descent travels in the opposite direction of slope to find the Global minima, with the smaller learning rate. Please correct me if I am missing something.

We take the gradient of J wrt m 2. If we have already calculated the cost function J at multiple values of m, then why do we need to do gradient descent because we already know the m where J is minimum 3. So we start with an m , calculate grad(J) at that point and update m with m' = m - grad(J)* learn_rate  and repeat till we reach some convergence criteria Please let me know if my understanding is correct.",True
