@zahidakitchentreats9719,2021-09-22T09:08:36Z,8,"Hello Krish, I think the whole concept relies on the following points.  =    ->   in 1d or 2d creates an object of the same memory location. Changes reflect  list.copy() in 1d ->  copies the value into new object. Changes do not reflect list.copy() in 2d  -> copies the object in a object into new object. Changes reflect  copy.deepcopy and copy.copy() works for 2d only.  copy.deepcopy() -> Creates new object and inserts copy of the objects. Changes do not reflect copy.copy() - >         Creates new object and inserts the original objects. Changes reflect  In short, we need to see if we are putting copy/original objects.",True

@ivansaiji,2021-04-23T03:13:35Z,11,"I feel you could have shown visuals on the memory allocation for the nested lists part.  The whole point as I inferred from your video is that if you have a shallow copy it will allocate space in memory for two lists but the lists will be pointing to the same items, whereas if you do it with a deep copy then new objects will be created and that's why they will be independent like that. Am I right?  I just think you didn't stress this point as well as you could have.",True
