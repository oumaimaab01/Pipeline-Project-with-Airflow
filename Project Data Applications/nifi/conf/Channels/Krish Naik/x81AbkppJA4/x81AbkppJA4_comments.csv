@vahiagyat,2021-07-09T11:58:23Z,1,"I see so many people asking shall we apply or not. Guys/Gals - rule of thumb ""always apply"". What can happen? Worst case scenario you will not get a call that's it - if you don't apply any way you are not going to get a call. At least there are chances that you can get a call if you apply. And one important thing once you start applying; you work on your resumes which will help you for other companies too.  So just apply. Check for the keywords - usually, these big companies have ATS in place. So it's important to handpick keywords. Better to write in STAR format. Action-oriented rather than mentioning the responsibilities.",True
