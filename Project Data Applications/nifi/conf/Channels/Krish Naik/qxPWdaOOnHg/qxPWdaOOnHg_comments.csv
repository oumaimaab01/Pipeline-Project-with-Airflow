Rtx 3070 and 3080 Look OOF in terms of performance especially for AI,Though ur Titan RTX is a beast in itself with the high VRam, I read an article somewhere back that the Gen2 tensor cores even in the Turing chips are 70% idle due to extremely fast matrix compute and they were just waiting for the memory to fetch data, Which is why i believe they came up with the newer GDDR6X which is way faster to make sure they utilize those tensor cores better, That also explains the fewer tensor cores on the 3070 as compared to the 2070 . I myself as a learner will be building the base 3070 build next month. I have read 8GB Ram is ok for beginners and learners. G0DSP33D",True
