I have personally taken such training and when I realized the way they tricked the system and tried to place me on the job market by faking my resume, I didn't want to go that route and left the training institute. It is extremely sad that most of the fresh out of college students especially those who come from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and  Nepal adopt a fraud route to get IT jobs in the USA.    People who are reading my comment here might think that  I am making stuff up. Check this site: http://desiopt.com/. There is a dedicated IT market place that adopts a fraud route to get you a job in an arrangement of 75%-25%. If they managed to place you in the job market, they take away 25% of your monthly salary until you work there. They even help to apply your H-1B and force you to be part of their Ponzi scheme for years to come. Here is the catch: you need to look BROWN.    If you are either of South Indian descent i.e from one of the countries of south Indian subcontinents or look brown, you are qualified to enter this marketplace. Your color, not the qualification that matters to get an IT job in this marketplace. This is one of the most racist things I have ever personally experienced. This is almost like brown KKK . I am comparing them with KKK because just like KKK enrolls only white people, these fraud IT training institutes only enroll people who look brown.   I don't have anything against those students who choose to take this route and get an IT job that pays six-figure. Personally, I would rather become an honest Uber driver than an IT guy who got the job by frauding a system.",True
