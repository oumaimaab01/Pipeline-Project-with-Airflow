It is because alpha is a hyperparameter (something whose value you set), set it between 0-1 and it remains fixed through all iteration from m = {1...M}. In this case however you dont need step 3.   If you dont want to set alpha by yourself, want to learn it from data itself, and that is adjusted automatically in each iteration for m={1..M}, use step 3, but from wikipedia link given in description.  Modification at 15:32 is done to make things look simple I believe. Awesome explanation. Thanks Again.",True
