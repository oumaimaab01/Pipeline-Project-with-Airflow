@sharanyabala8363,2021-06-07T17:23:01Z,2,"Hello Sir, Keeping the question and the background of the interview in mind, I came to the following conclusions. First, the role here of the data scientist is to identify if the third party vendor would require to do standardisation or normalisation (based on the distribution) of the data and then, give the third party vendor that dataset. 2. Also in some cases they may have to do data encryption. Identifying these techniques is probably a key responsibility of the in-house data scientist.",True
@manassavarshnis6811,2021-06-07T17:04:59Z,3,"When considering privacy of the data, we must first find out the features that may be the cause for privacy leakage. It might be features like age, country or gender etc. The simplest method will be to remove these features, but then these features might contribute to a better model building and removing them completely is not a really good idea.  We can maybe use encoding techniques like SMPC or homomorphic techniques. A very simple implementation of these techniques can be done using tf-encrypted which is very much similar to using tensorflow. But this might seem a bit complicated and I am a bit unsure if it will yield better results during model building.  So another method that we can do is create synthetic data or artificially generated data. But this method has some drawbacks too. So the method that we follow to preserve the privacy of the data depends on the use case and how important the features are during model building.",True
