@madhavanrangarajan6097,2020-08-04T19:35:41Z,6,"I think decision tree may not handle imbalanced data everytime. Because we are splitting each node using a metric(gini/info gain) .The goal of the split is to ensure the classes in each split of the node is very different. For example : We have 100 datapoints out of which 5 datapoints belong to one class. Now if the node splits  as 50 :50 ratio and all the 50 classes of majority class is in one split . The info gain will be high but we will not be able to recognize those 5 samples of minority class. Yes, no doubt at some point those 5 classes will be classified but it will be deep tree with lots of levels in it. Which means we may overfit. So we can use class weights /upsampling /smite in this case.",True
@pjsudharshan,2020-08-04T18:55:21Z,1,"And also for the outliers, if you have two or more hidden layers, it will be resilient to outliers and also input noise. You can very well check this by implementing it.",True

@pjsudharshan,2020-08-04T18:30:10Z,4,I would have to disagree with the part where you had mentioned decision tree is not sensitive to imbalanced classes. It can handle the imbalanced classes well but still they are influenced by the imbalanced classes (information gain and the Gini measure are skew sensitive). You have to use a weighted decision tree or GBDT to tackle this issue.,True

In the last fresher interview, the guy didn't worked on machine learning algorithms and now this guy has only done computer vision part in deep learning? why this is happening? why everyone is not doing each & ever part of machine learning & deep learning?   Just wanted to know that why people do this. I don't think so that it's a good practice",True

I'm expecting a reply grom u sir,True
@saswatdas6137,2020-08-04T15:50:34Z,9,"Pretty helpful.. Thanks for ur efforts..  But one suggestion here...  Unlike real interviews where once candidate answers about his project etc they go in depth about that particular topic and then the interview opens up..    For example here when Krish sir asked about ticket level like P1, P2 etc priority levels the candidate said he didn't consider them which is a lil bit surprising considering all ticket system has an escalation level.. So there he could have gone in depth and would have asked what are the important features then and how he determined etc...   Even when Sudhansu Sir asked which algorithm you have used he said Random forest regression but then he should have asked why this technique and preprocessing techniques etc.    Rest everything was very informative but the only thing is in interviews from our projects only they go in depth and then it opens up.   Keep up the good work and thanks for such fruitful sessions üëè",True
@prayagrajagrawal9050,2020-08-04T15:10:35Z,11,First time i am seeing   krish sir wearing interviewer hat. After watching i guess you enjoyed a lot this process.
