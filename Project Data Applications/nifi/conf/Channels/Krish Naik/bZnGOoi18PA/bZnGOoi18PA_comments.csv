@rohank9292,2021-07-14T11:34:38Z,3,"In my first company, HP (now DXC) it was company policy to keep the good performing employees to stay stuck doing the same job and without any salary bonus or even recognition, while the managers would purposefully hamper the promotion of good employees to keep them working in the rut, while those less deserving employees who were the boss's best pals were given steady promotion and even better perks and compensation like on-site visits etc. The manager himself would ever so subtly convey that anybody who would be the best performer would get a chance to go to US. Forget about the US, the good performers were not even allowed to move out to a better project! I secretly went and gave the interview for a different and better project to get selected. Similarly, the company had this uncanny way of making its employees focus more on IJPs than on better opportunities outside. And the way that they did all of this rubbish was to promote such people to the higher position who would tow their company policy line and show off to be such high fi shots of themselves that we had to follow whatever bullcrap they had to say. You could recognise them by the way that they had am air of superiority and overconfidence about themselves. So, nowadays whenever I see an employee of DXC wearing an air of superiority or over confidence in himself, I tend to ignore and stay far away from them.",True

@vahiagyat,2021-07-14T08:02:57Z,2,"Find your own ""reason"" strong enough and you will be good. Reason for working towards something not only limited to Data Science but any aspects of life. And unlike popular belief, it doesn't need to be a ""philosophical"" reason always. What I mean, if you got hurt by someone's comment and want to achieve something just to show him/her that u can do it - it's good enough. I have seen and have done myself too - any feeling that keeps you motivated is good (of course not hurting others).   I am not saying make that a revenge motto of your life else u will be consumed by itself. but use that energy to drive you :) And over the course of life...once you get used to the habit - you don't need that feeling. For example, you may start a gym to provide someone but if you do 6 months..this becomes part of ur life...now u don't do to show someone but for urself :)",True
