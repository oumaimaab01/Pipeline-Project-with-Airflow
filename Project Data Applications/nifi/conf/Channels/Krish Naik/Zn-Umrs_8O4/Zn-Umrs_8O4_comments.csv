@anant.awasthi,2021-07-13T05:37:09Z,2,Consider another side of it. I have closed all the interview-related feedback on the same day and communicated it to the Candidate. The candidate is coming back when it's just a week left of joining that he cannot join. It's painful for a recruiter too.,True

@kirtipandya4618,2021-07-12T18:10:50Z,1,This is very very common. Candidate also says YES for the job at first and before 2-5 days of joining says NO as he/she found better place. HR is not promising anything.  Companies take 5-10 interviews for single role so they need time to reply. Cannot expect company cannot say NO after a weeks. Your interview was nice but other guy was better than you for that post.,True
@vishwanathvt7701,2021-07-12T17:58:32Z,1,HR people always do ghosting. They call for an interview then ghost candidates without saying the results. They wont come up. This happens everytime at least I have experienced many many times. Its their job to communicate with candidates properly. From my perspective they are not doing their job properly. They are actully not the right fit for the HR role.,True

@ankitac4994,2021-07-12T16:37:40Z,1,I agree but the interviewee should have applied to other companies as well on a safer note instead of assuming being selected for that company.

@ABHINAVKUMAR-on3mb,2021-07-12T15:32:00Z,4,Disclaimer: It's just an option by keeping on both sides I guess it equal from both the interviewer side and candidate side. Companies want the best candidates and candidates want the best companies. Companies keep candidates on hold and candidates during the joining period keep companies on hold for maximum time to apply for better companies. Both keep each other at backup.,True

@Ujwal.v,2021-07-12T14:45:12Z,33,"I changed 6 companies in 8 years, and I have given & Taken interviews, so I know little more,  1)ALWAYS ASSUME you are NOT selected if they dont get back to you in 2 days, (you can follow up, but don't assume you might've been selected) 2)Don't take anybody's word, unless you get it in writing 3)On the contrary, ASSUME you did not get selected and keep giving interviews 4)When team has a doubt on you, that's when they say among themself ""Lets interview few more ppl""   Morally speaking, HRs Should never keep you waiting, similar to how we reject one offer when we get a better offer after 2-3 months of keeping them waiting(This is more common than HR not giving offer) But both are possible, but if u just wait for them to get back then its your big mistake  CONSIDERATION is NOT SAME as SELECTION, even selected candidate can get rejected if not given in writing",True

@shiva_acharii,2021-07-12T14:12:25Z,5,"I don't agree with this @krish. when candidate can reject offer at last moment and join a better package company, why cant HR do same? yes, if HR gives offer letter and joining date and then saying rejected is wrong but all this incident happened before offer letter releasing, so its okay for HR team and Tech team to search better candidate which fits there job requirement.",True

@krishnaik06,2021-07-12T13:53:55Z,39,Have you faced this kind of issue? My take is that atleast the candidates should know right after the interview whether the person has got selected or not. And candidates should not be just dependent instead keep looking at jobs,True
