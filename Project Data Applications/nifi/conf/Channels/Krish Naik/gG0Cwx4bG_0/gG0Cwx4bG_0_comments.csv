@shilashm5691,2022-01-29T03:19:16Z,0,"In bagging it will only have a row sampling with replacement.  So when we do train a decision tree,  it would endup with correlated trees,  because same feature will be repeated in every trees, so solving this we introduced a random forest,  where we use column subspace, which means we can only bulid a trees from random subset of features, so it introduced a randomness in the features,  so we endup in uncorrelated tress in random forest",True

@dr_IkjyotSinghKohli,2020-12-28T18:32:47Z,5,"The most important word in the phrase ""data science"" is *Science*. Sorry, but these videos are not encouraging people to do good science, rather, they are encouraging one to memorize a number of statistical principles and the ""workings"" of a data science algorithm and regurgitate it to impress the interviewers. And what people don't see is that Krish has set up a store selling his t-shirts and products all the while trying to convince people that he can prepare them for a data science job. Sorry, this is not how a data scientist can be successful.",True
