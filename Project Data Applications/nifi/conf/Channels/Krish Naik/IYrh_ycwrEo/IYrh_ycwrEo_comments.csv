@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-25T19:01:57Z,4,"Data scientist Chip Huyen (who has just left NVIDIA), recently tweeted this: ""The article I‚Äôd love to read: Become a machine learning expert in 200 weeks with these 10,000 easy steps."" üòÅ It's a great reminder that, as you said, Data Science is not easy. It is incredibly fulfilling as a job, but it's not easy to learn, nor is it easy to stay good at it. Again, just as you mentioned, you never stop learning. Personally, I think that's one more thing to love about data science. One other main thing to love is how powerful data science can be as a tool for solving all sorts of problems (big or small). üòä",True
