@pankajackson,2021-01-26T23:22:23Z,0,Such a good explanation but theres a small mistake in line 52 n 53. Parameter should be test_sample and test_label instead of using train data that u created to train ur model,True

@generationwolves,2019-12-19T07:35:20Z,3,"Thank you for the video. In addition to the issue on lines 52/53 that the others pointed out, the scaled train samples were never used to fit the model. Also, the test samples were never scaled. Just bringing it notice so people can make corrections accordingly.",True

@elmlt,2018-10-12T21:41:04Z,1,"Thanks for the video!  It really helped me (I am just starting to explore the world of ML, tensorflow & Keras, and have not found many good hands on step by step examples)  But I think that there is an issue in the example.  In line 52 & 53 your code says:  52: test_sample =np.array(train_sample) 53: test_label = np.array(train_label)  I think it should be:  52: test_sample = np.array(test_sample) 53: test_label = np.array(test_label)   Due to this issue, I understand that the prediction was made with the same data that was used to train the model.  Right?  (maybe this is why you got such good predictions)  But this still helps to learn how to create the models!!",True
