@rakshitsinha4392,2022-01-08T19:25:07Z,4,"Following will be my approach: 1) Divide the sea/ocean into various regions depending on the presence of breeds of sharks. For example, some sharks live near the poles, some live near the equator and some live in the middle region between the equator and poles. We'll segment the regions accordingly. Note that this ""segmenting"" will also take into account various oceanographic conditions (thus it requires extensive domain knowledge). 2) For every region, take up a large sample and divide it into 'n' number of subsamples. Use bootstrapping with repetition to calculate the mean of the region. 3) Use the mean of each region to calculate the weighted average of the entire sea/ocean",True

I will use the following steps- 1. As the sea would be large then first I would divide it into clusters based on location and then I will take samples from all  these clusters and  I will treat all these collected samples as population  2.Next I will use the 'Stratified sampling technique' and for this, I will divide all the sharks into strata based on their breeds this will decrease some variability 3. Then to obtain samples from each strata a' I will use Neyman Allocation technique'  4. Then I will calculate the weighted mean of these stratum means i.e weighted mean of strata means  = Σ Ni (Xi bar )/ N Where Ni = Size of each stratum              Xi bar = mean of each strta samples              N = ΣNi Hope its fine and we can use it for more appropriate result",True

@BalaMurugan-cm6ev,2021-04-09T11:09:13Z,22,"Two Ways we can do   1. Using Central Limit Theorem  ""Get more number of samples with replacement from the population. The Mean of the Sample means would describe the Population Mean"".  Randomly record the Sharks length of samples Size which is greater than 30. Then Calculate each of the Sample Mean. . . It would indicate approximately/closer to the Population Mean. This gives the Point Estimate. We can't exactly said this is the population mean.   So we will use Confidence Interval = x̄ ± Z * s/√n  where s = Sample Standard Deviation Z = Z Score value when confidence interval is 95%  x̄  = mean of sample mean n = number of observations  If we see Z Score Value of 95% using Z Table. We will get Z = 1.96  x̄ ± 1.96s/√n   => By applying all the values we can say 95% of sample mean would be in this interval  2. By using Hypothesis Testing  Step 1: Let's assume we have a theoritical value of sharks length  around 2 feet  H0 (Null Hypothesis) : The population mean (2feet) is same as Sample Mean Ha (Alternate Hypothesis): The Population mean is different.  Step 2: Set the P value as 0.05 and Collect the random sharks length data  by using Z -test/ T-test , we will conclude whether we accect the Null or Reject the Null.
