@shabareesharyan,2022-10-21T16:26:00Z,0,Sir i love your videos but this was too much big brain work to divide the normal curve into two parts and subtracting 50% + z score value to get right side area of the curve when we could have directly subtracted the z score value from 100% xD :v,True

@snehalgaikwad6436,2021-12-09T06:57:11Z,0,For random data can we apply the z score to convert it into the standard form so that it will give good accuracy? or the data must have gaussian distribution then only we can apply Z score?
