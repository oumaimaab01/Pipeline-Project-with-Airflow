@shyamkrishnan9769,2021-01-14T14:32:57Z,0,"Hi Sir, Great video, At first I was amazed to see such a video in your channel. But later got to know the reason after watching this video. Sir, I have a humble request. I can notice that the camera is shaking a lot while post these kinds of non-technical videos (mostly in last 2-3 videos).  Please  try to avoid it if possible in the next upcoming videos.",True
@gauravamit,2021-01-13T12:17:34Z,2,"I think a lot of this has to do particularly with ad-revenues of FB which is going to take a major hit - thanks to Apple. Apple has brought in major privacy rules since their iOS 14.3 release that disallows sharing of data across apps. For app developers, it becomes mandatory for them now to highlight two aspects of data 1) Data used to track you 2) Data Linked to You. you can see this by visiting any app on apple store. This is has been made mandatory for all apps if they plan to update their app versions on the store.    Interestingly, Google has not yet updated any of their apps since mid Dec. Wonder why!? :)  Anyways, since now that this information be out in the domain, it becomes mandatory for FB and its products (WA, IG) to start looking at all sort of ways to monetize and maximize their efforts to make ads relevant for all users of their platforms. I believe this is why they have out rightly asked all users to accept the new privacy laws. While yes no one is going to be reading chat messages -  but here are some questions to think about -  Can we have metadata or some sort of labeling done to names of groups on WhatsApp?  say you are part of investing, parenting, sports group can they profile a user with interests in ""Sports"", ""Finance"" and ""Parenting"" Can these labels then be used for creating relevant ad lists? Could I enrich this data or use data points across platforms to target you digitally?  This is just my understanding and I am sure some experts here with relevant experience can add more insights to this?",True

@Lagergaming69,2021-01-12T14:42:30Z,3,"Until and unless there is no law like GDPR in india, big tech will continue to profit from user data.  WhatsApp forcing us to do one thing will lead to it forcing you to do other things. For how long? This is bullying of the user.  Switch to telegram or signal. Stay safe guys.",True
@vahiagyat,2021-01-12T13:48:04Z,2,"I work in the Ad-Tech domain as a Technical Product and Program Manager, specifically in DataScience, RPA, and e-Commerce. So, I do understand it's a gold mine for Analytics use cases, and there are many use cases that can be monetized easily. Most of the people don't have an idea what all go behind the scene when you visit some website and a simple irritating Ad is shown to you. You simply close it or maybe once in a while click on it. But a hell of information is shared from various sources ( if someone wants to read more: https://anantjigyasa.com/programmatic-advertising/ )  Anyway, my point is - Will it help in Analytics use cases? yes, definitely but the world is much more than just the use cases. Companies have social responsibilities too. And just for clarification - ""It is only in the European Union that WhatsApp is legally bound to not share its data with Facebook."" Data protection laws in India has various loopholes.  But yes, definitely there are lots of misinformation as clarified in this article - https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/whatsapp-privacy-fake-claims-misinformation-busted-do-not-believe-these-false-myths-7140889/   But given the FB reputation, this fear is not baseless!Especially when Whatsapp is forcing us to accept it or be kicked out. Brian Acton co-founder of WhatsApp (also founder of Signal) had a drift over the monetization of WhatsApp and displaying Ads over the WhatsApp in past and had to leave the company! So, whatever WhatsApp says as of now - we all know where it's heading!  P.S: Recent clarification given from WhatsApp: ‚ÄúNeither¬†WhatsApp¬†nor¬†Facebook¬†can read your messages or hear your calls with your friends, family, and co-workers on WhatsApp. Whatever you share, it stays between you,‚Äù the platform said. In a thread, it added, ""Our privacy policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family.""",True

@akhileshgandhe5934,2021-01-12T08:32:30Z,6,"Hi Krish. I respect you a lot, but I disagree with most of the points which you have told/read in this video. I don't remember that I have pressed ok for terms & conditions but I would like to tell people my observations: 1. 2 months back my friend told me to use normal servicing center instead of honda and use some engine oil - chat on whatsapp. And in the evening I started getting more and more engine oil ads on facebook. 2. My friend bought a new home and he informed me, from next day I am getting atleast 1 call per day to buy a plot or a home somewhere.  The thing is if it is encrypted or not they are sharing my personal info with others. My phonenumber, my location and my mobile phone model. So as per the use case its beneficial to them as well as to us to some extent only. They are saying in future we may share it to 3rd party apps. Then imagine...!! They are able to read my personal chat, And if they say its encrypted they are lying intelligently because its encrypted and company doesn't directly look into it. All this data will go into training the ML Models.  Guys please watch the documentary movie 'The social dilemma"" you will understand what am speaking, what's wrong going on.",True

@rk-wy8pu,2021-01-12T05:24:36Z,6,"The main question is - Do we actually trust the answers given by whatsapp in their privacy policy FAQ ? Honestly, I don't think so. We need to come up with alternate social media platforms specially designed, developed and hosted completely within the borders of india. Else we will slowly (already started) give up our freedoms to these foreign platforms and will be at their mercy that they can silence us anytime.   The 4th World War will be an information war.",True
