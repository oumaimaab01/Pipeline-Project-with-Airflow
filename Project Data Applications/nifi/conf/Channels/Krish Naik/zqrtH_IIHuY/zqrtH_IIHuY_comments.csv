@tanmaydeshpande2409,2021-01-31T04:44:06Z,1,"Hello Krish sir!  I am working on a project named   *Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles in different weather conditions* For this, we are using *A2D2 Semantic Segmentation* dataset. This dataset contains images with their annotations ready.  Our aim is to create a model which is robust in different weather conditions.  For the adding the different weather effects, have used different Image Processing Techniques for image augmentation for 4 weather effects : rainy, foggy, cloudy & snowy.  Now for Semantic Segmentation, we are using *ENCODER-DECODER* model where we are using VGG16 pretrained model on Imagenet + FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks).  I am trying the standard process of adding convolutional layers, deconvolutional layers, unpooling, etc for the FCN part but i am not that confident.  *Questions:-*  1) How should i approach FCN part? I am doing trial-error for this purpose. Any suggestions.  2) I have created 950 images of each weather condition. The annotated images of all the 4 weather effects will be same. Can it overfit the model where the truth value will be same for all the 4 weather effects?  3) I was thinking of adding another feature extraction NN which will provide information about the weather effects. The o/p of this feature extraction network would be added to the FCN part to increase robustness of the model.  Any suggestions or tips will be helpful.  Thank you & Stay Safe!",True
