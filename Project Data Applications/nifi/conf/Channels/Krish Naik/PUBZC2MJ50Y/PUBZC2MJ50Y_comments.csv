@p1xedge,2019-09-05T03:40:22Z,16,"#point When we have the whole population, each data point is known so you are 100% sure of the measures we are calculating.  When we take a sample of this population and compute a sample statistic, it is interpreted as an approximation of the population parameter. When the standard error increases, i.e. the means are more spread out, it becomes more likely that any given mean is an inaccurate representation of the true population mean.  As the sample size gets closer to the true size of the population, the sample means cluster more and more around the true population mean. x-bar~u-miu (nearly equal to) when sample size increases towards population and standard error decrease.",True
