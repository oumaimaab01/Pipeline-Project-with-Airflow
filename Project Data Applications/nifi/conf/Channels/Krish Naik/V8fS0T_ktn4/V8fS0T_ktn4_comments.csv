@soumyadeeproy6611,2021-03-01T12:24:05Z,13,"Hi,I have a small doubt which is: U said for each category, one model is trained which outputs its probability of being correctly classified. Now, when each of the models is independent and thus yields independent probability values, then how you are saying that their sum would be equal to 1 ??  I hope I made my question clear",True
