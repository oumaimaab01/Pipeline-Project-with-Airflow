@yashwanthkumar4890,2020-08-21T19:53:49Z,0,Correct me if I'm wrong.  Bag Of Words ( count or Binary ) and TF-IDF will only give the values based on the frequency of the occurance and doesn't process based on semantics. To get the output based on semantics we need to use Word2Vec. @Krish Naik,True

Teach us the domain knowledge wrt Datascience Fine with any specific domain. Also make a video explaining what are the data points to look for choosing a machine learning algorithm for example when do we need to go for Random forest for classification and when for SVM etc. I know you have covered couple these concepts in your earlier videos but a playlist with only these details at deeper level would work. Keep the good work going. Thanks a ton. You are a great inspiration.,True
