If you do that, i'll be interested in doing it, just watching videos and define personal raodmap is not that evident. I'm a software developer, and the field of data with regards to maths is not easy.",True

@MegaReelfilms1,2024-04-16T06:49:26Z,1,"Krish, if possible, please give me a reply. It will be a big relief. I was transitioning into data science/machine learning back in 2020. In an accident my neck muscles were injured and I had to be on bed for a long time, it took me two  and half years of physiotherapy to come back to normal. Once I was somewhat normal I came back to Bangalore and joined a company doing what I used to do -  social media management and video editing/effects. I had learned the basics of programming and the required math before the accident. Last one year I was focussing on this job because it is important for my survival - rent, food etc. I lost 4 years and I am starting out my journey into machine learning once again. People who started out with me back then have heavy ctc packages now. But I am still at ground zero starting everything from scratch. My lost 4 years make me depressed. Do you have any advice?",True
