@user-ez3xi6fk5l,2024-02-29T07:42:01Z,1,"Detailed Summary for [Complete Statistics For Data Science In 6 hours By Krish Naik]  [00:02]This section introduces the basic differences between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics in data science. - Descriptive statistics includes topics such as measure of central tendency and measure of dispersion. - Tools like histograms, box plots, and whisker plots are used in descriptive statistics. - Topics covered also include probability, mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and various distributions such as Gaussian, log normal, binomial, Bernoulli's, Pareto, and standard normal distributions. - The section also mentions techniques like transformation, standardization, and q q plot for determining the normality of a distribution.      [41:02] In this section, the speaker explains the concept of probability density function (PDF) as the smoothening of a histogram and introduces the concept of kernel density estimator. - PDF is the smoothening of a histogram. - Kernel density estimator is used to create the smoothened PDF. - Bar graphs are used for discrete data, while histograms are used for continuous data.      [01:22:07]This section explains how to draw a box plot and introduces the concept of variance. - Median, Q1, Q3, and maximum values are identified on the x-axis to create a box plot. - Outliers can be identified and removed using the lower fence and upper fence. - Variance is calculated using the formula: (sum of (x - x bar)^2) / (n - 1).      [02:03:10] This section explains how to calculate the area under the curve using the left and right tables. - To calculate the area, you can subtract 1 minus the left area or directly refer to the right table. - The left table provides the value between two points, while the right table gives the value for a specific point. - The left tail of the curve represents the remaining body, and by subtracting 1 minus this, you can find the desired area. - The left tail z table is used to find the z value for a given area, such as 0.2 and 0.25. - By subtracting 1 minus the obtained area, you can find the percentage of scores that fall above a certain value.      [02:44:15] This section explains the concepts of independent and dependent events in probability. - Independent events have equal probabilities for each outcome and do not impact each other. - Dependent events are influenced by previous events and have changing probabilities. - An example of a dependent event is picking marbles from a bag, where the probability changes after each pick.      [03:25:18]This section discusses the concept of confidence intervals in statistics. - Differentiates between one-tailed and two-tailed tests. - Explains the definition of point estimate. - Mentions the importance of sample data in inferential statistics.      [04:06:22]The chi-square test is a non-parametric test used for categorical or ordinal data. - It is important to understand why a specific test is used in an interview. - An example problem is given about the ages of individuals in a small town in the 2000 Indian census. - The results of a sample of 500 individuals in the 2010 census are also provided.      [04:47:26]The section discusses hypothesis testing and correlation. - The speaker explains how to determine whether to accept or reject a hypothesis based on the significance level and p-value. - An example is given to demonstrate the process of hypothesis testing. - The speaker mentions the use of correlation analysis and shows a correlation diagram and pair plot using the iris dataset.

It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random).

(Human bias) 4) Collection techniques- as technology progresses still these companies rely on old conventional way of inferring the results. Most of them rely on structured data or on survey reports but in todays Data driven world unstructured data can predict better results which all companies are lagging.",True
