If you are considering the Gini impurities or the entropy whichever of them, you would still have the similar information gain and the same feature gets selected and that feature would still classify the records in the same way (just as the 1st iteration) and hence the misclassifications would still remain the same. I think you have to get a bit of clarity on that and then could explain about the iterations post updating weight what exactly happens differently so that the misclassifications might go a Lil less or chances of Miss classification goes a Lil down.

@sonumis6626,2022-07-27T19:38:47Z,1,"Adaboost in summary: Unlike Random forest, Adaboost combines weaker learners (Decision Trees in a sequential manner) The decision trees (DT) in AdaBoost are single split/one depth on nature and are called decision stumps (DS) To develop a single base learner, it first compares information gain of each DT based on each of the feature and selects the DT with information gain/entropy/Gini impurities. This becomes the week learner. This method does not follow Bootstrapping. The number of decision stumps it will make will depend on the number of features in the dataset. Suppose there are M features then, Adaboost will create M decision stumps. Following are the steps in Adaboost:  1. A new sample weight matrix will be used to assign weight to each observation. for N number of records, the initial weight will be 1/N. 2. To generate the first base learner/week learner (BS), M decision stumps are generated for the M number of features. Based on their information gain, best DS is selected. 3. From this DS, total error (TE) is calculated based on the misclassification of samples by that DS. If total misclassification is T, TE=T/N where N is number of samples. 4. Based on TE, its performace score(PS) is calculated, PS= 1/2*log(base e)((1-TE)/TE) 5. Based on PS, new weights will be assigned to samples that are classified correctly and incorrectly. 6. New weight for incorrectly classified sample: old weight * (e**(PS)) 7. New weight for correctly classified sample: old weight * (e**(-PS)) 8. This will increase the weight of incorrectly classified samples and decrease the weight of correctly classified samples. Which means that the next BS classifier will have to give more importance in learning the incorrectly classified samples. 9.If the summation of the new weights are =! 1, we need to normalize the weight as : (new weight)/ summation of (all new weights) 10. Based on new weights, some buckets/ranges/classes of normalized weights are formed. These weights will be used to form the new sample set for classification be the next weak learner. 11. Based on some iterations for N number of times, and psudo randomly generated numbers between (0-1) the new samples are selected from the old sample list based on where it falls in the buckets of normalized weights. 12.The process between step (2-11) is repeated till the error reduces to the minimum. 13.During the testing of data, each data will be classified using the multiple BS, and a majority voting will be used to generate the final output.     ps: Feel free to correct me if I made any mistake..",True

@bhargavasavi,2020-05-14T13:03:57Z,0,"Hi Krish, I have a question....How do you calculate the Total Error for the 2nd DT... Is it based on Normalized weights? For example if two records are misclassified corresponding to 0.07,0.07 normalized weights....Is the total error 0.07+0.07 ? Also I am not clear on updating the weights of records for the 2nd DT(specifically because when we are sampling for the 2nd DT, we get random records which can have duplicate rows too, but while updating the weights should we update all the records with the new sampling weights?) .........Hope you have understood my question :)",True
@bhargavasavi,2020-05-14T06:56:15Z,3,"Krish was mentioning 8 iterations for selecting the records for the next learner...there are really 7 records...it will choose a random bucket 7 times...and since the max weighted values mostly will be present in the larger bucket size, probability of rand(0,1), most of the time the maximum bucket will be choosen.....Genius technique!!",True

@ashisharora9649,2019-11-28T15:22:41Z,486,"Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting) Adaboost combines multiple weak learners into a single strong learner.  This method does not follow Bootstrapping. However, it will create different decision trees with a single split (one depth), called decision stumps.  The number of decision stumps it will make will depend on the number of features in the dataset. Suppose there are M features then, Adaboost will create M  decision stumps.  1.  We will assign an equal sample weight to each observation.  2. We will create M decision stumps, for M number of features. 3. Out of all M decision stumps, I first have to select one best decision tree model. For selecting it, we will either calculate the Entropy or Gini coefficient. The model with lesser entropy will be selected (means model that is less disordered). 4. Now, after the first decision stump is built, an algorithm would evaluate this decision and check how many observations the model has misclassified. 5. Suppose out of N observations, The first decision stump has misclassified T number of observations. 6. For this, we will calculate the total error (TE), which is equal to T/N. 7. Now we will calculate the performance of the first decision stump. Performance of stump = 1/2*loge((1-TE)/TE) 8. Now we will update the weights assigned before. To do this, we will first update the weights of those observations, which we have misclassified. The weights of wrongly classified observations will be increased and the weights of correctly classified weights will be reduced. 9. By using this formula: old weight * e performance of stump 10. Now respectively for each observation, we will add and subtract the updated weights to get the final weights.  11. But these weights are not normalized that is their sum is not equal to one. To do this, we will sum them and divide each final weight with that sum.  12. After this, we have to make our second decision stump. For this, we will make a class intervals for the normalized weights. 13. After that, we want to make a second weak model. But to do that, we need a sample dataset on which the second weak model can be run. For making it, we will run N number of iterations. On each iteration, it will calculate a random number ranging between 0-1 and this random will be compared with class intervals we created and on which class interval it lies, that row will be selected for sample data set. So new sample data set would also be of N observation.  14. This whole process will continue for M decision stumps. The final sequential tree would be considered as the final tree.",True
