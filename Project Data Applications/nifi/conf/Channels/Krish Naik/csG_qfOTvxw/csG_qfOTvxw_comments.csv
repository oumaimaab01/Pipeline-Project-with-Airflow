@mohammadanas3047,2019-10-08T10:59:28Z,0,"I think you would also want to add some database skills into this whole loop. Though there is a dedicated data Engineering team that works independently from the data science team. But when you ask them to retrieve some data for you, they would tell you to run some queries and retrieve data through appropriate joins. To all this fantastic display, I would add  SQL skillset as well, but not from the administrative perspective but just as enough as to be able to retrieve data from the database for further analysis, where a bigger part is played by data Engineering team to guide you through the whole process. But you should have some knowledge to effectively communicate with them, to ask them as many questions as possible and the right ones indeed.",True

This will enable us to learn application along with theory, and will be less boring as well :D.  Try to do reverse engineering of the Data Science solutions to problems, and try to think on your own on how did this happen and why was this method choosen.  Also, keep learning and applying the knowledge you learnt on other projects.  Keep an open mind, actively search for data sets to work on, learn new things by working on them.  All the best!
