@user-bd6fp1kj7u,2024-01-31T02:02:36Z,0,"Hi Krish, I had a doubt for time series. I am having a dataframe with 2000 datapoints (spectral data-Xs) out of which I am having Y values for only 30 datapoints which i am using for model training and testing along with 3 4 more similar subsets. Now if i try predicting the remaining 2970 values, will the model be biased as it is a time series data? Or i can consider it as good as an unbiased test set?",True

@haneulkim4902,2023-11-11T01:12:20Z,0,"Thanks for great video. So when I have great performance in all train, valid, and even test dataset it data leakage is the only problem? Are there some other problem that lead to such issue? Currently my model is doing too well on all of train, valid, and test dataset however I know from experience that performance on testset shouldn't be this good. I've check all the data preprocessing steps and I did split data in temporal fashion, scaled or filled missing value for each train, valid, and testset independently. I'm still having too high performance on testset. What other issues can there be?",True

@sandeeppanchal8615,2021-06-10T11:47:28Z,0,"Another scenario- before splitting the data, suppose we 'fit' vectorizer like BoW or TFIDF, etc, on the whole data set and after splitting, we will 'transform' both train and test set. Since the entire data has already been fitted to vectorizer, after split, transforming test set means data leakage. Only after splitting, 'fit_transform' should be done on train set and 'trasform' on test set (also CV set if created).",True

@SR-ng5kw,2020-10-20T16:06:55Z,0,"I have a doubt here , what if train mean and test mean are totally different. Wont the model learn from train mean and then fail on test data. I beleive the universal mean is a better value for missing value imputation as it represents the global distribution. If your test data is totally different from train data anyhow your model will fail in production.",True

@madhureddy5328,2020-01-22T07:42:59Z,3,I am a new learner in data science course.  In time series analysis  when we split data. Do the data is splitted (test data) accordingly required.      Because my doubt is like when we split  data randomly there is a chance of getting a old data in test dataset and new data in training data. So that may leads to decrease in accuracy right.   Is there any way to split data accordingly that can cover equally through out the data set at every  corner equally splitted or like covering latest data as test data.  Not like covering only latest data or old data. As you are saying we train latest data as testing. Can we split in this way.  If possible can you make a video related to splitting data.,True
