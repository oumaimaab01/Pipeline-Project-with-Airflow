@drchandril,2021-01-28T08:29:53Z,0,"Hi, I enjoy your tutorials. Thanks for making them. Appreciate ur help.   I have observed a problem about the random forest (RF) regressor recently. Thought of sharing and hear your view. I have a dataset with categorical variables (numerical binary, e.g. gender: 0 or 1). My target variable is continuous variable (e.g. salary). When I tried to run RF, the R-Square came to 1 (which is unreasonable). But when I ran the same codes with continuous input variables (e.g. age), the R-Sq was a reasonable figure (0.2).   So, should I infer that Random Forest, or decision trees (in sklearn) DO NOT support one-hot encoded/categorical input variables to predict continuous variables?",True

@bruinedrol1,2020-05-12T09:00:36Z,0,"Hi Krish Naik, If I'm not mistaking there is a slight error in your explanation at around 8:53 you are talking about that a single decision tree has low bias and a high variance but I think this is incorrect. Actually, a single decision tree (simple model) has high bias and low variance. The more complex your model gets the lower you bias and the higher your variance.    Quote from an article at Medium: ""What is bias? Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data.''

But if I want to classify diabetes patients As type 1, Type 2, gestational at the same time, Does it(RF) enough to classify patients with types or other algorithms are needed? How and what is the next task for it? Except decision tree which machine learning (SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, Deep learning etc) can be converted into rules like decision tree?
