@mrkrud,2024-04-21T21:36:47Z,0,Very much appreciate the insight!!

@rahulme,2024-03-30T05:45:13Z,1,Yeah but yesterday i seen a video about github copilot. It creates vulnerabilities in the code. Also i am working in cognizant and they had license of copilot. But recently they told that don‚Äôt use the copilot for client codes. Every client restricted not to use it in the codes. Its not safe for now. But in future it will be safe. Also I don‚Äôt think devin will be perfect as industy level codes are not public and it will never have data about how actual project works. Also it needs so much data to get trained. Possible but not for now. Also each one of us can write codes without knowledge so companies will take interview and hire those who has actual knowledge.,True
