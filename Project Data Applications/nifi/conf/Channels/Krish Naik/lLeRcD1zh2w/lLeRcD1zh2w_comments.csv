@kameshparashar,2021-04-23T18:36:34Z,2,"What In personally think is that, ANN's are useful for regression problems for big datasets. But they are not much accurate when it comes for CLASSIFICATION of TABULAR DATA. But deep learning is best for NPL, Image, Text processing etc. So long ans short: If you're in a hackathon which is regression with huge data use Deep learning. But most of the hackathons are Classification of tabular data, if thats the case use ML models. My personal fav is LightGBM.",True

I have a doubt, you said if we have more complex data we can go with Deep learning but if we don't have resources then can we do PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques then  applying ML algorithm, does it make sense?",True
@CreativeSpacebyAshwani,2020-09-14T03:12:02Z,0,Hi... I have one question.. Is Deep Learning is different profile than ML. Machine Learning job is different from Deep Learning?,True
@anandhasrivi,2020-08-28T06:39:26Z,1,"Main use deep learning is if we have non relational data like image, audio ,time series and text . It would be best to use deep learning  as it handles the feautirization. In machine learning we need to perform featurization and convert it to relational table format. @krish naik",True
@rehanbaig71,2020-08-17T19:57:03Z,1,"Sir, a bundle of thanks you cleared this doubt in a best way. From your point of view and from my knowledge in the field of IT and Machine learning and Deep learning, I have some conclusions, someone may not agree.  01. You said that Machine Learning is normally / usually applied on small data sets. As day by day volume of data is increasing having exponential growth. And number of data generators are also increasing ultimately results in increase in volume of data. e.g Iot devices, Youtube channels, patient's data, insurance data, bank's data and many more like these. So in near future volume of data will be very large in every case and so ultimately Machine Learning will be only theory. 02. Few days back GPU was out of range of individuals and small organisations. Now a days this issue has been resolved by google colab. I have a core 2 do system with 4 GB RAM and 180 GB SSD without any other storage but I am using GPU on google colab. 03. If any organisation having large volume of data and free GPU can easily use Deep learning.   Although its upto certain storage capacity but I think the cost of more paid GPU storage other than free on google colaboratory will be much less than the annual cost of domain expert. 04. According to my point of view future is deep learning. Sir I request you to reply this comment in any case either you agree or disagree. Because you vision in the field of ML and DL is very vast. Your reply will broaden beginners vision also. Thanks for your efforts to train beginners like me in this field. Your videos gave me a very clear picture about ML and DL. I once again request you to give your feedback on my opinion. Thanks.",True
