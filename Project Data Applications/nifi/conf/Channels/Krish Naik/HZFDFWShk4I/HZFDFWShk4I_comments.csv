@brentcos9370,2021-02-09T22:41:38Z,1,"I find Github very awkward and overly 'technical'. I find it bizarre that a recruiter would be surfing around such a convoluted, seemingly messy looking 'website'. To the layperson (me), Github appears way too busy and cluttered. Like a junk drawer in someone's house. ""Here's a bunch of folders and files for you to navigate"". This is coming purely from a recruiting viewpoint. I suppose I can  see the code being held in a Github repository makes sense for a techie. But for recruiting purposes, why not create an eye-appealing PDF report of your project that you can keep in the cloud storage and simply link it in your resume? It'd be easily shareable by the recruiter and everything could be inside (code, screenshots, overview, graphics, etc.). Keep in mind, I'm new to data science and maybe Github is the standard...it's just bizarre to me.",True
