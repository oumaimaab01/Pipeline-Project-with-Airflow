@prateeksahu3876,2020-09-20T23:43:05Z,8,"Stock market scenario:   Case 1 : we have predicted it will crash ,but it did not (False Positive) . Focus on precision score. Case 2 :  we have predicted it will not crash ,but it crashed (False Negative) .  This will do more damage than case 1.  Hence, we need to Keep FN low (high Recall) . Case 3: If client specifically wants a balance i.e we don't want too many FP or FN . Focus on F1 score.",True
@admitra7512,2020-09-20T15:19:29Z,3,"Hello sir, in response to the question asked,here is my answer. so the problem statement is to predict whether the stock market will crash or not.  here the FALSE POSITIVE would be/Type 1 error rate would be: our model predicts that the stock market crashes but in reality it does not crash(predicting something true when in reality it is false). here the FALSE NEGATIVE would be/Type 2 error rate would be: our model predicts that stock market wont crash but in reality it crashes(predicting something false when in reality it is true).   so in context of the stakeholder or someone who is really into buying stocks,that person would try to minimise the False Negative rate as it brings much more harm to that person, as a lot of money is attached to the stock market,perhaps.",True
