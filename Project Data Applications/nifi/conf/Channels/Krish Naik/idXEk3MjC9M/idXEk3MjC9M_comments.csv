@mandelbro777,2020-09-13T06:16:45Z,50,"I like your videos, but you're in error here. Quant - doesn't signify 25%, Quart does. You are describing Quartile points, which bound a special type of Quantile. Quantiles can be any arbitrary catchment domain from points A to B, they don't need to signify quarters (ie, Quartiles). Percentiles and Quartiles are both types of Quantile. The most confusing part of these definitions however are whether/how these 'iles' refer to the limit points which bound the 'iles', or whether they refer to the results, which always makes description of quantile methods fraught with confusion if not stipulated very clearly by the technician presenting the method. Personally, when I state Quantiles, Percentiles, or Quartiles, I always state both the upper and lower bounds being referred to rather than assuming the audience/reader will understand general applications. Better safe than sorry [confused] I say.",True

@lokprakashmahap1072,2019-09-03T18:10:35Z,15,Quantiles is a generic term for dividing distribution into interval ranges. It is expressed as q-quantiles. So quantiles is not sacrosanct of the 25%ile range or interval. It can be a decile or percentile with 'q' being 10 or 1.,True
