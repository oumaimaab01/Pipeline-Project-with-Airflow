I.e, when we are working on regression model  6. Pierson Co-relation Co-eff can be applied only on numerical features. It can be applied between a feature & target and also between features  If we find 2 features that are not co-related, we can remove one of them.  7.

@VVV-wx3ui,2020-01-11T09:41:33Z,4,"I think the starting point of Data Science is the Analysis of Data and these tests determine the Algorithm and the Regularization method to implement to minimize the cost function (RSS).  Read recently that  1) Co-variance and Multi-Collinearity would have impact on the Coefficients and NO impact on predictions 2) There are L1 and L2 Norm regularization methods. A study (Mark Schmidt CS542B Project Report December 2005) says that L1 with Optimizing Least Squares is better than L2. Reason being that L2 does not address Parsimony (sparsity) of the  model and Interpretability of the coefficients values and all it aims is Shrinking the Coefficients. L1 regularization has many benefits of the L2 and yet, sparsity and interpreting coefficients is easy.  While above two are understandable in English but not as Statistics. May I request you to cover these, if possible, in your next session.    Its so nice to see ""whys"" and ""whens"" in this video, which I think is the matter for Data Scientist. Great Work Krish.
