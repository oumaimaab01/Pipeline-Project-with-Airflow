@TheDataMaestro,2019-12-04T18:11:48Z,1,"We hear so much about how the field of data science is exploding in all businesses. Krish appropriately cautions us not to think that data science can be applied to every business scenario. That we just need to round up some data, and go from there. This will not happen and we will learn that in the not too distant future that upwards of 40% of data science projects either led to false conclusions or were completely unnecessary. Then, our field will take a big hit. Stay tuned...",True

@BiancaAguglia,2019-12-04T16:45:06Z,11,I particularly liked the advice about realizing that not every problem needs machine learning (many times a bit of code and some logic will be faster and better than an ML algorithm) and about thinking like a problem solver. 😊   The entire list of tips was spot on though:    1. Real world data is rarely clean and rarely in one place.    2. All projects need to start with a clear understanding of the business problem they are trying to solve.    3. Not all projects need ML. A simple code and good logic can often solve even complicated problems.    4. Storytelling skills are important.    5. Google is a data scientist's best friend. 😊    6. Data science is an ever changing field. It's important to keep learning.    7. Most importantly: always think like a problem solver.,True
