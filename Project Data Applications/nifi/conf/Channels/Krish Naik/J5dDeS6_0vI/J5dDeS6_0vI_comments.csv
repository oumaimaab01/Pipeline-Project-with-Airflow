@keshavsharma267,2020-06-05T12:19:15Z,4,"Very aptly said. Data science has evolved into a magic wand everyone wants to have in their arsenal but they can have only a limited number of items in it. So over the years, Data scientists had to acquire Software Developer and DevOps skills as well. But that does not mean that you can manage with basic data science skills and be an expert in coding and managing the life cycle. The soul of data science is still and always will be Statistics/Math along with domain knowledge.",True
