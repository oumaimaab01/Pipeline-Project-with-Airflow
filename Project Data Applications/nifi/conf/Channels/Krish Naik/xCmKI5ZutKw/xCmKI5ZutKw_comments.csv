@datnohi8612,2021-10-26T14:35:09Z,0,"I disagree with the people aspect, yes you will get to meet new people, but sometimes those people are not always good people and they might expose you to some bad habits, I worked in a brick and stick for years and most of my co workers were self centered, snobs and bullies. They made working in an office a nightmare and stressful. I would have rathered talk to the customers over the phone than deal with them coworkers and i had to see these people every day and could not stand any of them. Working from home took that stress out of my life I'm alot more productive now that I don't have to worry about dealing with the bullying issues",True

@abidtaqi3842,2021-10-11T12:52:35Z,1,"WFH increases productivity if I wish to be productive.But in case of WFO many disturbances and situations occur for that reason productivity decreases. But to know collogues better, to discuss, to build good relationships we can sometimes visit office like 2-3 days a week. But WFH is best for really learning any new technology and grow!",True
@utkarshwadhwa,2021-10-11T12:07:01Z,3,"WFH increases the confidence and makes you much more independent. In office, everyone is approachable for help but in WFH you need to think twice before reaching and calling someone for help. Hence, majority of the times you find solutions on your own. Moreover, you can spend time in self learning new things as travel time is not there, you save money, you maintain a good balance between everything, more focus hence completing assigned task much early, etc.",True

@heavyDriver320,2021-10-11T08:49:20Z,0,"Maybe for initial 1 year or so still understandable, but other than that WFH is still the better option as per me. And getting help from team mates and learning is totally dependent on individual and their team mates. My team mates are super helpful I can call them or stay in a call and unmute for a few seconds to see or know something new and simply done.. Also not to mention the travelling time and all other chores before and after office they easily take up 3 to 4 hrs every day, if I can save that time I would even be happy to work for 1 hr extra hour everyday if needed.. And speaking of saving some money, in India at least, freshers are paid such low salary so often that it comes down to sustaining at the place let alone saving.. And no ""taking a nap in the afternoon"" is not really something everyone does, but even if so, if someone is still delivering the desired outcomes, I don't see a problem with that.. If someone is happy he or she will definitely be more productive.. I guess in this discussion here we have to agree to disagree.. Giving individual option is the best solution according to me.. Thanks again for the content you are providing, your videos are very inspiring..",True

@ravitanwar9537,2021-10-11T07:41:55Z,1,I think instead of choosing between work from home or work from office we should look at hybrid systems where people are allowed to come to office for some part of the year and then later on remotely because even though collaboration is important we dont need to be in office 365 days. So yeah hybrid model should be there,True

@shubhambaghel219,2021-10-11T06:23:20Z,0,"Obviously we are decreasing our productivity day by day working from home. We work with lots of distractions at home and after giving equal amount of time we are less productive. Advantage is we are saving in lot in terms of money and time by not spending on travel, working attire maintenance, also reducing pollution to some extent.   It should be hybrid .

@Kush_N_,2021-10-11T05:35:09Z,0,Sir my take is Work from home my young brother who happens to be with IT is working over 13 hrs a day as a fresher. I am a newbie in code and my industry is Media I am an Art Director but even freshers in my industry work for nearly 12-13 hrs a day. work from home means extra work. for me as a senior in Industry it would be ok as we are used to with workload but my juniors are having an equal amount of pressure as I am having and My young brother who is an IT professional is also having an equal amount of work. at the end of the day it goes the same way.,True
