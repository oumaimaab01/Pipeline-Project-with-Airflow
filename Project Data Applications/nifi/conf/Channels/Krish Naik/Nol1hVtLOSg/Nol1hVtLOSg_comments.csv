@Zelloss67,2024-03-11T11:20:46Z,0,"@krishnaik06 could you please comment  Where is the gradient btw? As I know in real gradient boosting we teach weak-learners (r_i trees) not to predict a residual, but to predict a gradient of the loss function by y_hat_i. This gradient is later multiplied with learning rate and step size is thus obtained.   Why to predict gradient instead of just residulas?  1) We can use complex function with logical conditions. For example -10x if x<0 and x**2 if x>2. Thus we punish model with negative score if y_i_hat is lower than 0.  This is the major reason",True
@thetensordude,2023-11-01T21:16:58Z,1,"For those who are learning about boosting, here's the crux.  In boosting, we first build high bias, low  variance (underfitting) models on our dataset, then we compute the error of this model with respect to the output. Now, the second model that we build should approximate the error that we have for our first model.  second_model = first_model  + (optimisation: find a model which minimises the error that the first model makes)  This methodology works because as we keep on building the model the error get's minimised, hence the bias reduces. So, we get a robust model.  Going a bit more in depth, instead of computating the error we compute the pseudo residual because the pseudo residual is proportional to the error, and we can minimise any loss.  So, the model becomes,  model_m = model_at_(m-1) + learning_rate * [derivative of the loss function with respect to model_at_(m-1)]",True

@newbienate,2023-10-12T19:09:48Z,1,should the sum of all learning rates be 1? Or close to 1? Coz I believe by that way only we can prevent overfitting and still reach closest to true functional approximation value,True
