@darshanpadaliya7829,2023-12-24T06:13:48Z,1,Very informative.....  But if generative AI will be grow up with this speed..then data science is the one of the career who will near to end ...  Because your all big task done by big model...you don't need to do anything.....  No data .. No data cleaning.. No EDA.. No model building..  Only need :- deployment...  And in deployment company have great software development....who definitely done this part.....  So this generative AI  definitely.... impact on data science career....  Company need 4-5 data scientist.... because 60-70% work already done in big model.......  This is only my point of view.....,True
