@hashiharis8169,2022-07-20T19:20:27Z,14,"The interview questions are good and even the guy who is being interviewed is performing with confidence. But what I have a suggestion is, even though this interview had good questions, the way of conducting a professional interview should not be like this. An interview is not meant to stress the person who is being interviewed and confuse him. It is the responsibility of the interviewers to conduct an interview in the most peaceful calm way. We are humans and mistakes would be answered by everyone, anyone can be wrong, but the mistakes should not be pointed out in the middle of the interview, which inturn will drain the confidence of the interviewed guy. This kind of attitude is not expected from a professional interviewer. It becomes the responsibility of the interviewer too that if they point out a mistake they should correct the mistake by letting them know the concept or the right answer. Honestly, interviews are meant not to stress or pressurise the person or the people watching this mock interview. So it would be better to conduct such interviews in a modern way. Research the interview rules and post mock interview videos instead of pressurising the freshers. They do deserve a respect for their hardwork from the interviewers, even if they are not getting job atleast behave to them with a consideration as they are humans and not as a machine learning model trained with some stress parameters.",True
