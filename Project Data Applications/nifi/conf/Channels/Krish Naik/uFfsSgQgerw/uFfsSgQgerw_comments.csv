@karnvarshneya3019,2024-01-13T11:49:55Z,0,"bnde ne conics nhi pdi hai....  distance between point and line, for some point (x1, y1) and some line ax+by+c=0 is: |a(x1)+b(y1)+c|/[(a^2+b^2)^0.5] for our purposes, we remove the modulus on the numerator. also, note that the denominator is nothing but 2nd norm of weights. as we have removed modulus, all points below the line will have a negative distance from line, and all points above will have positive  from the line. now, let us say that all points below line are given label '-1' and all points above line are given label '+1'. as mentioned, the assigned label y_i, multiplied by the signed distance for data point x_i equals 1 when classified correctly. i.e. y_i*transpose(w)*x_i/||w|| > 0 --> correct classification, and  y_i*transpose(w)*x_i/||w|| < 0 --> incorrect classification.  WE REMOVE ||w|| BECAUSE WHEN PUT IN ABOVE INEQUALITY, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, NOT BECAUSE ||w||=1.  as we want to maximize number of correct classifications, we maximize the cost function he mentioned in the video. i hope this helps. as i have learned over the course of the year, there is no learning data science without conics, linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. guys, please study all this carefully, so that you are able to identify mistakes like these and not be misled. apart from this mistake, great video, as usual.",True

@loyavivek5479,2023-10-18T10:49:19Z,0,Actually different sources have different cost function.

@TauroChuck,2022-03-14T07:38:52Z,0,Hi I want to know has anyone tried finding optimum W for maximum value of sum(YiXiWt). When I tried I get maximum value when W tends to + infinity. When I  change values from 0 to -infinity same values repeat but -ve this time. My data is  one set of X and Y. Y i have transformed to +1 and -1 instead of 0 and 1.  What Krish says makes perfect sense.We ignore Y intercept and focus on only slope and try to optimize it for the data set but  It doesnt seem to work. I was expecting the summation to have max value at a particular slope value and that value to fall once change in either direction. Anyone has any take on this algorithm that Krish speaks about. I couldnt get another reference for the same algorithm.,True

@MrSanjibdutta,2021-02-08T07:15:05Z,0,His approach to attack the problem from root  and gradually proceed to the solution is  awesome..But I think he somehow mixed up SVM discussion with LR discussion. Probably because of that he was forgetting LR range as -1 and +1 vs 0 ans 1. As per my understanding the input to sigmoid function is not y.WtX but just Wt or Wt+b. But that's minor thing.

@SoumyaDasgupta,2020-12-16T19:59:07Z,4,"For people having doubts in and around 11:00 - so the thing is the multiplication of y and w^t.x is a representative feature. the output of this is either positive or negative. If its positive, the classification is correct, if its negative, the classification is wrong for the particular case where the markers lie above or below the line.   .Case1 : if blue marker is above the line, so its +ve (w^T.x is positive), and the distance between blue point and the line is positive, hence the product is positive, the classification is correct (because points above the line the points are supposed to be +ve).  Lets take the red marker above the line, red represents -ve and its above the line, so the product of them is -ve, so its a wrong classification as anything above the line should be positive ((w^T*x is positive but red point represents -ve,sp the product is negative).   So,in summary,  for the points above the line - If the product is +ve, its correct classification, if the product is negative, its an incorrect classification.

@priyankjain9970,2020-07-10T10:46:37Z,0,Something is wrong. Sigmoid function is used to find values between 0 and 1(ie for calculating Probabilities) and not for dealing with case of outliers. You need to have equation like y = mx+c and value of mx+c is passed in Sigmoid function or  W^T (x)(which is also mx+c). We never pass Y*W^T (x) in Sigmoid Function. Function of Sigmoid is only to calculate probabilities.  Little bit of wrong explanation in the end but otherwise video is good. Good Effort,True

@GyanendraChaubey-IITJodhpur,2020-05-23T11:19:52Z,6,I have a lot of doubts. Please take a very short data set (with 5 to 10) examples to make the understand mathematics of it more clear. Initially you have taken the y classes as +1 and -1 but when you will use sigmoid function the result will be in 0 and 1. So how you predict your class actually with mathematics? You haven't explained about the weight updation. How the error is calculated and weights changes to improve the accuracy? You have done classification with only two features. How to do it with multiple features? Please explain all these to make more clear understanding.,True
