@harshmodi7627,2024-01-23T17:07:49Z,4,"Upon reading the documentation and paper on CBOW, I have two questions  -   1. You explained that when we chose a window size, for example 3, we take 3 consecutive words from the corpus and take the middle word as target word and words before and after (1 each in this case) to provide context for the target word. However the documentation says that  the number of words we take as window size determines the number of words taken before and after the target word. So for example if we take window_size = 3, we take 3 words before and 3 words after the target word to provide context.   2. We can chose the hidden layer to be any size. It is not important that it matches the window size, since the input layer does average or sum of the input vector and hence it's size is always [1 x V] where V is the vocabulary size. The input-hidden layer matrix is on size [V x N] where N is the hidden layer size, and then the hidden-output layer matrix is of [N x V] and finally the output layer if [V x 1]  Can you please clarify my doubts here",True
