I've been programming since the past 2.5 years. And so far I got the opportunity to work with python only for a year and it was mainly data analytics and basics of data engineering.  Now I'm in a Java big data project. But the question is every company has several projects that contain different architecture and so sometimes it's difficult to get and expect what you want. So how can you give some idea as to why some companies choose Java over python. Even though the demand for python is definitely rising. I can only see jobs in Java coming up more. I'm based in Germany. I don't regarding the market scenario in India and US. For fresher's it's always tough.",True
