@YavuzDurden,2022-09-01T16:43:30Z,0,Hi. Why we not just select this 0.98 scored dataset. If we want to choose this 0.98 scored dataset how we can do this? I mean how to achive this dataset scored as 0.98?,True

@vaibhavkhobragade9773,2021-09-08T11:21:08Z,2,"Thank you @Krish for such a great explanation. I have a question, cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv = k_fold_validation)  we are passing X and y from original data without using training data. We also assume that X and y have missing values. If we do imputation on X and y, is there any data leakage problem in cross-validation? if it is how could we handle it?",True

@nishikantgurav4500,2021-05-05T11:18:46Z,0,"krish, in k fold cross validation code you passed directly X and y without splitting so how can the model will know what will be the percentage of training and testing data? cv=10 will take 10 random_states that is  each random state is having different data that will give 10 different accuracies. But my question is that how can the model know the percentage of splitting? Is we have to split data with train_test_split giving percentage of splitting and then cross validate with cv=10? please help in this.",True

@shubhamchoudhary5461,2021-04-28T23:11:51Z,2,"Sir , in machine learning suppose if the model is overfitted & we apply k-fold cross validation on top of that model k-fold(10) , then we get to see lots of variation in cross validation scores right ?.Such as Score = [ 40, 80 , 70 , 80 , 50 , 83.2 , 81,84 ,.......] Means , here diffn between highest & lowest accuracy is ( 84 - 40 = 44) which is very high , means our model is overfitted & not capable to perform on unknown data situation , hence we need to regularise it &do hyperparameter tuning .Make me correct ..Thank you!!!!..",True
