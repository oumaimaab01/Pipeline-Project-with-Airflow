@BiancaAguglia,2019-08-29T17:34:27Z,22,"Great advice as usual, Krish.  One extra tip that works here, in the US, is to go to local meetups. The meetups for data science and Python are a good start, but there are also many meetups for local businesses. They give you chance to meet business owners who don't have technical skills but have many problems that can be solved by good data analysts or data scientists. If you can help these business owners understand ways in which data science can be implemented into and useful to their business, you might be able to get a job offer. 😊",True

@jeet7033,2019-08-29T17:22:56Z,12,"I am a B.Tech in IT but never worked for any IT company . I started working for a small refractories company near my home town in marketing domain after failing to land a job in IT sector after trying for more then 10 months .I am working with the same company in marketing till date never switched. It is important here to mention that i have always been very passionate about technology. now after almost 7+ years of exp in marketing your videos have reignited my passion for tech. I am very thankful for that as i have been stagnant for all these years though i did some Android development in between just for fun. I don't know if i'll be able to switch to Data Science as a career with such a bizarre profile as mine , though i would love to make DS a part of my professional life. But i think now i am just learning DS to satisfy my passion so it doesn't really matter. Thanks again for these videos Thank You from the bottom of my Heart.",True
