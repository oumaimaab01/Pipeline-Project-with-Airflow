It‚Äôs then I started reading about NLP,  NER. Learned little bit python to implement SpaCy. But everything seems to stop at a point where I need to train the model so that it can give accurate result. I read blogs from Medium.com. Tried reading about ELMo but those models r too complicated for me to train. Specially as I totally a c# developer and scripts in Python and its environment are so new to me.

Your talk and video is negatively pushing them into a field where they will have to start from scratch. Please dont get me wrong.
