@nikhardoshi9486,2023-03-16T20:27:29Z,4,"To everyone thinking about k=1 case, generally for Chebyshev's k>1. Let's say that k is 1, then according to formula, between range of 1 std, there is data more than 0% which essentially means that there is some data in that range, although that's not very useful so I believe that is the reason to keep k>1!",True
