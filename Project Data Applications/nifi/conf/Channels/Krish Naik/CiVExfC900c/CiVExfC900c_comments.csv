@hadisuharwardhy9394,2020-08-29T16:46:08Z,6,"In my opinion, a two page CV for freshers does more harm than good, no one likes to read 2 pages for a CV when they have to go through 500 applicants for that day. For higher up roles, i think this is fine because people have enough skills, work experiences and projects to showcase, people who are about to graduate or have little to no experience have a few skills and a few projects and at the same time have to face the most competition as the number of applicants everywhere is in hundreds if not thousands.   So I like a clean one page CV, divided into two parts vertically so you have all the qualifications and skills on one side and the projects on the other.  PS: If I have half the skills that you have on this sample CV and I still don't have a job then the problems isn't the CV it is something else. .",True
