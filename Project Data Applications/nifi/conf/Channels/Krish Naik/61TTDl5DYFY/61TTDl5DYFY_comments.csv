@BiancaAguglia,2020-04-17T17:46:43Z,1,"Teaching something we're in the process of learning is indeed a great tool for mastering new skills, but it's also very humbling because it shows others that we're still not very good at the things we're trying to learn (and our egos struggle a bit with that. 😊) Not many people have the courage to publicly show their weaknesses.    You're right to say that your teaching and story telling skills have improved. Your videos are useful but also engaging to watch. 😊Keep up the great work.",True
