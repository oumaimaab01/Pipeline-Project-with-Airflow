@AkashRusiya,2024-05-05T20:17:15Z,2,"For anyone who is confused with 'bar plot' explanation, it neither shows the 'sum' nor the 'max' value. Instead it 'represents an estimate of ""central tendency""'. By default the 'estimator' parameter is 'mean' so it's showing the average values of total_bill for each sex @4:50 . Also, the bar plot does not necessarily need to have a categorical feature, i.e., you can run ""sns.barplot(y='total_bill',data=df)"" and it will run fine.",True
