@kannanlg4979,2021-08-11T03:30:06Z,0,"I don't understand why Indian companies are so much behind current salary and percentage increment based on that. The fact is that the new job has NOTHING to with previous role. Everyone needs to accept the fact that it's a new org with new clients, new use cases, new challenges and hence the salary should also be new (and not an update based on old one). Firstly the people applying for interview need to come out of this kind set. I see this is a motto set here. I have interviewed all around the world, you don't find this culture of comparing current and expected salaries anywhere else. Not but not the least, if a salary is confidential to the company, an employee disclosing it during the interview to someone in another company is a crime. So is the crime when HR asks for current CTC. All they need to worry about is the expected salary and if it falls within the budget. If it is within expectations, move ahead. People are not comfortable discussing their salary with their colleagues so how are they comfortable sharing it with someone in a different company - weird mind set.",True

I believe it is the only way to get a better hike in many cases, and should be used in any case possible at any stage of your career. All companies are out there to shaft you. It is in their best interest to pay as less as possible.  If you were the owner of the company,  you would also want to pay as less as possible.",True
