@rezapourbahreini4473,2022-07-13T11:14:59Z,0,"thank you for your tutorial. There's one serious issue that I want to address here. As far as I know, we're not allowed to do anything that results in leakage from test data to train data. So when you do a fit_transform on a train_data and save the parameters in the scaler, it's okay to do scaling on the test data based on that very scaler, but not the other way around!! Because there would be a leakage for mean and s.d from train data to test. This way always the result would be better but it's because of the cheat that is happening and the model really. So be careful with the order of steps you go through when scaling train and test data.",True
