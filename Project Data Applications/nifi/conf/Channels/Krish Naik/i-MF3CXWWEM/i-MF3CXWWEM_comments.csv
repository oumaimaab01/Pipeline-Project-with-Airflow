@rashmiranjannayak8965,2023-10-06T14:37:23Z,0,"can u tell how the entorpy is calculated over regression , as much as i know u talked in classification not in regresion",True
@sandeepmane8694,2023-06-29T17:19:28Z,0,hi krish can't get data from kaggle it is paid ...i tried please all video dataset in your github link to get easy,True
@shakeelahmad3162,2023-05-07T16:24:03Z,0,"Hi, please answer my question!  My Dataset: 20 independent Features, 9 dependent features (outputs). (20 Temperature sensor values corresponding to 9 deformation values in metals) Which is better for selecting best independent  features. 1)PCA analysis 2)Variance Threahhold 3)Pierson correlation 4)information gain for regression",True
@elvykamunyokomanunebo1441,2023-03-26T08:24:32Z,1,I've not seen any other course that covers this. You've earned another rocket point from me :) Thanks krish Naik,True
@maskman9630,2022-11-18T11:15:56Z,0,What to do when those important features have greater p-value....?,True
@videosforfunn,2022-09-12T12:15:25Z,0,I am somehoe getting values greater than 1. What could be the reason?,True
@yashsaxena7754,2022-08-11T19:09:26Z,1,11:41 I think I would disagree here. You said 'SalePrice' is 52% dependent on 'OverallQual'. I believe the right statement would be there is a 52% reduction in uncertainty of the value of SalePrice if we knew 'OverallQual'. Thoughts?,True
@soumodeepsen3448,2022-05-03T16:42:27Z,0,numeric_col = df._get_numeric_data().columns can give you the indices of the numeric-features columns.,True

@waytolegacy,2021-11-23T13:17:18Z,0,"Sir, can we also get the MI in between all the features as we did in the correlation video? Because if one feature affects another we might want to remove it which relation was not caught in the df.corr() â€” isn't it?",True
@louerleseigneur4532,2021-07-24T11:17:12Z,0,Thanks Krish,True
@ilkersenturk9614,2021-07-19T15:16:16Z,0,"To select all numeric types, use np.number or 'number'",True
@kyriakospelekanos6355,2021-07-09T11:12:05Z,0,great info. So is it good practice to train our model only on these features?,True
@karthikganesh4679,2021-03-19T14:38:11Z,0,sir kindly do video with respect to recursive feature elimination,True
@vaibhavthapli7216,2021-03-10T04:19:14Z,2,"Sir , Can u please tell us which feature selection technique is more effective for selecting features (select top 20 percentile features, OR  select top 10 features )",True
@rakeshkumarrout2629,2021-01-28T06:49:46Z,4,Please make a video on how many startups working in this data science and AI field ..and what they exactly doing..in details..is there a scope..how many people you need...what should be their specialization?? about team building ...,True
@dataanalytics2593,2021-01-28T05:39:45Z,2,"Hello Sir Krish... Sir i want to know somthing ..In deep learning every epoch provide us accuracy and valid accuracy as we written in the code.. So, what will be the accuracy should i have to choose gor final accuracy of my model. I means last epoch's accuracy we i have to choose or some other from all the epochs providing highest accuray.. Waiting for yours response.. Thanks.",True
