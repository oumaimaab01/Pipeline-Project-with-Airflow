@deepika2472,2022-09-19T13:26:56Z,2,"hi, it would be really helpful if you share the exact links of the videos that you mention in your videos. Some of us may be looking only for a particular concept and not the whole ML series.  Thank you!",True
@AjayKumar-id7mb,2021-08-29T23:17:39Z,0,"It is not sensitive to outliers.Since, extreme values or outliers, never cause much reduction in RSS, they are never involved in split. Hence, tree based methods are insensitive to outliers.",True

@AK-ws2yw,2021-04-17T14:39:23Z,13,"For Classification Decision Tree should not be affected by outliers as it calculates best split based on Gini Impurity or Information Gain criterion, however for Regressor Decision Tree algorithm calculated Mean Squared Error for each value, in which case outliers would affect result, thereby we need to consider mean or median imputation before building model",True
@vimalthanth1147,2021-04-05T04:03:53Z,0,"if depth of DT is large then, leaf nodes contains very few points. so outliers can impact on such trees.",True
@bishwajeetsingh8834,2021-03-31T09:30:35Z,0,"if the outliers are in the predictor variable then there will be no effect on outliers, but if the outlier is in the target variable then there will be an impact (not necessarily)",True
@debadattanaik3467,2021-03-27T19:47:50Z,0,"Hello Sir,                If my table consists of a large number of features set that are having binary values.

@PriyankaSingh-gc1ze,2020-12-25T22:33:26Z,2,"Decision Trees can be impacted by outliers if the decision tree constructed is very deep, as when the trees are very deep , the chances of overfitting the noise increases  and outliers  will  have higher possibilities of impacting the tree in such case",True
@vaddadisairahul2956,2020-12-02T08:36:41Z,0,"Outliers do affect decision trees but are not handled implicitly in algorithms like ID3 and C4.5. However, CART handles outliers using cost complexity pruning.",True
@bhumikalamba186,2020-10-25T09:16:51Z,3,Outliers increases the chances of overfitting of the decision tree unless the pre-pruning measures are specified. Post-pruning can also help to prevent making overfitted decision boundary regions.,True

@Agrima_Art_World,2020-05-19T02:57:52Z,42,"Outliers does not impact Decision tree as they DOES NOT USE any distance metrics to calculate .They uses probilities by entropy,information gain or gini  index to create the tree.So basically no impact",True

@nikhilgupta4859,2020-04-02T04:41:29Z,6,"Most of the people are commenting that there is no impact...however i think  outlier has impact in DT regression as we are calculating SSE.If there are outliers then SSE will be high,so we will not take the variable in the split,nomatter it is significant or not.",True

@babupatil2416,2020-03-23T13:15:19Z,5,"We can say outlier is the one which is located distant away from all the data points, in case of Classification, distance never comes into picture, here we calculate Entropy then Information gain(some times Gini Impurity as well) whichever node gives best IG that node we select as a root node and the process continues. In case of Regression we chose that region as root node for which residual sum of squares is minimum, if we have outlier in data then RSS is always high hence we don't select that region which has an outlier at all. So in this way Outlier Doesn't have an impact on the Decision Tree.",True
