@akashravindra..,2022-02-07T08:51:01Z,0,"To everyone here you need to understand  that Instructor led are not really good. I dont want to quote a platform but I have used it personally and they read out the set slides given to them I might better as well use ""Read out load"" option from Adobe. They are instrucor led and have used it and its really bad. They want to finish off the course as fast as possible. Its really not good. And pre recorded are good because you can increase the speed of videos .  I watch videos at 1.5x speed and trust me you should try learning videos at fast pace which you can find in pre recorded videos.   What happens when you watch the videos at 1.5x is you will be totally attentive to what they are saying and it gets rid of pauses they take between speech. Try out it might help you.  I am not saying it will work for all but try it out.   I am sure  Krish will agree with this method of learning. Learning with pre recorded will help you be more attentive and not worry about pace at which Instructors try to teach you because some teachers are slow speaking and some are high so you can regulate that in Pre recorded and not in Live instructor led.",True
