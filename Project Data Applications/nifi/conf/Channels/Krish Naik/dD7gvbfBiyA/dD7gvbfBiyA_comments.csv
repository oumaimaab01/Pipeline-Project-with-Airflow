@audreyduong92,2022-05-14T07:22:03Z,0,Can we use soft voting for multi-class classification instead of binary classification?,True
@CkyYEN,2022-04-21T15:24:17Z,0,Nice video with detailed explanation! Thank you so much!,True
@hussainjafariqbal3073,2021-10-15T16:26:30Z,0,What is the difference between a voting classifier and Random Forest? if both r same why to use hard voting Classifier?,True
@divyshah992,2021-10-11T16:22:55Z,1,"good informative video but also do some math practice as it is very easy to calculate the average of 0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9 = 0.75 no need to say around 0.85",True

@shushantpudasaini2306,2021-02-25T15:06:42Z,0,"Hello sir, your videos are awesome. I wanted to clear on confusion. I am creating hard voting based classifier with 4 classifiers. What if the 2 classifiers predict positive class and 2 classifiers predict negative classes? What will be the voting decision on this case?",True
@haneulkim4902,2021-01-09T13:16:21Z,0,Thanks Krish. What about for regression problems? is there hard and soft voting there or do we just take the mean of all outputs?,True

@shoraygoel,2020-02-24T13:58:57Z,0,when to use what?,True
@fotisnas,2019-11-30T22:38:45Z,1,in hard classifier how does it classifies 2 zeros and 2 ones?,True
@palanupam1557,2019-11-23T12:30:34Z,0,the average at @5:20 is 0.75....but  its okay great video,True
