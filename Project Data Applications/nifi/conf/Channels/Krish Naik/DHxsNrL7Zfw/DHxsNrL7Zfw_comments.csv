@ghostwhowalks5623,2022-05-14T22:04:11Z,0,"Great video Krish! I followed your code to the end...well almost...I'm getting ""FitFailedWarning:"" error (even though I have the exact copy of your code. Trying to figure it out...but if u've seen this before, would appreciate some advice. Thanks!",True
@MrDacruz19,2022-05-05T00:51:25Z,0,"Thanks for the video. This is exactly what I was looking for! You have my like and subscription. Btw, I also followed you on LinkedIn. Thanks Krish.",True
@aliathar891,2022-03-11T10:18:45Z,0,Thank you brother,True
@zeromodz,2021-10-26T15:51:57Z,0,Why are you passing train data through your gridsearchcv??? You're supposed to pass the full X and y for your cross validations...,True
@bhavinmehta8773,2021-07-14T03:57:55Z,0,Why test accuracy is changed by every run ??,True
@AmirAli-id9rq,2021-07-12T11:42:16Z,2,"I have a basic doubt why do we need to mention ""RandomForestClassifier"" in pipe. Can I mention any other classifier as well in this case LogisticRegression?",True
@RoxKwon,2021-05-22T10:48:25Z,0,"can we have a pipeline to get the best hyperparameter for regressor and other please, more on pipeline tutorial please",True
@amirtaghavy7647,2021-05-12T17:30:14Z,1,"Fantastic no-beat-around-the-bush get-right-to-the-point educational video. Thanks, Krish!",True
@RJ-dz6ie,2021-01-12T11:22:41Z,1,"Hello Krish... It's a great video.  You scaled the data before gridsearch but while doing gridsearch you haven't scaled data. Doesn''t it impact accuracy? Why you did not use scalar in pipe line for Gridsearch? We can make a pipeline with scalar and estimator and use this pipeline as estimator in Gridsearch right!!",True
@arjunpuri1104,2020-11-03T02:15:18Z,0,How to do hyperparameter tuning with different datasets,True
@SidVanam,2020-11-01T19:09:25Z,1,"Very clear video, but would love to see hyper parameter tuning with Bayesian optimization!",True
@midos2200,2020-09-08T04:08:56Z,0,This way does not work on my notebook. I dont know where is the problem.,True
@karthiavenger4577,2020-07-22T10:59:00Z,0,How to know what are parameter are there ?? Uses of those ??,True
@mayankpant5376,2020-04-07T03:56:31Z,1,How can we do kfoldcrossvalidation in pipeline? This is importent!!,True
@hemrajbhatt1034,2020-02-01T13:16:43Z,0,Sir I am getting error while fitting pipe in pipelines (ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)),True
@vipindube5439,2020-01-20T22:07:48Z,2,How to check this model accuracy could be overfitting?,True
@bhavyaparikh6933,2020-01-17T12:50:39Z,1,you are great!!!,True
@jigneshjash89,2020-01-17T05:09:00Z,2,Thanks Krish!!! It helps a lot for helping people solving few basic concepts in very easy manner,True
@ouryly1541,2020-01-15T18:46:18Z,3,"Krish, why do you initialize the pipeline with the random forest. Why that step is important?",True
@mauricioalfaro9406,2020-01-15T18:35:23Z,9,One suggestion: import warnings  warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')  So you donÂ´t see any warnings in the notebook,True
@0568raju,2020-01-15T17:09:59Z,2,Excellent. Sir Please continue this series with pipeline.,True
