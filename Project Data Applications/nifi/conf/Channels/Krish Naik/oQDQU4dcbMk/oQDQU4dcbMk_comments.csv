@JamesWattMusic,2020-02-04T04:47:09Z,1,Feature engineering and Front End are more useful than all the new data driven models.  Modeling is just a handbasket that we can loop through them all to get best result.  Features and interpreting the data efficiently and correctly is most important.,True

@BiancaAguglia,2020-02-01T18:46:36Z,11,"No, I don't think at all that data science will become stagnant. On the contrary, I believe it will become more widely used and here are my thoughts on that:      1. For the near future, I think data science will expand fast across all sorts of businesses not just the bigger ones. Small companies might be intimidated by all the talk about big data and might think that data science is not for them, but that's not true and many small businesses have already realized that. Even if a small business generates a relatively small amount of data, they can still use the power of data science to gather big data from other sources and use it to get a better understanding of their own data and make better business decisions.      2. Also for the near future, data science will get a better reputation once we learn more and more about how it's used not just in business, but in important non-commercial areas like science research, medical research, education, etc. Those are the things I'm most excited about when it comes to data science. üòä        3. For the long term, data science will become a common yet ever more powerful tool. The more problems we solve with it, the more time we'll have on our hands to focus on problems we thought unsolvable before. And, even if we solved all problems on earth, we have an infinite universe left to explore. Data science can definitely be a tool in making sense of it. üòÅ   As far as AutoML and other automation tools go, it's only natural that we build better and better tools. We've always done that throughout history. Yes, it can be frustrating, because, as someone said it, ""the shelf life of our skills is getting shorter and shorter"", but the payoff is that better tools can help us solve bigger problems. üòä",True
@derickpearson866,2020-02-01T18:43:08Z,7,"Yes data science is an evergreen job.  Data Science is simply the new term used for a statistician who programs, econometrician who programs, data miner, database analyst.  All of these careers now have more tools and data to utilize to create more insights.  As long as there is commerce, there will be a need for someone to use said data to drive sales, profitability, and efficiency/optimization.",True

@murugeshmanthiramoorthi9938,2020-02-01T18:27:38Z,12,"In a recent meet, Sundar Pichai has mentioned that data privacy is the next big thing. Recently as a Bangalore based medical firm has changed their cloud storage from Google Cloud to Azure because of privacy concerns, there could be some stringent norms for companies to collect data about the users.    Another thing is Blockchain which is a decentralized data storage and transaction framework.  It is built on the concept like all the data are privately held and no corporates can collect user data without their permission. So if big data is not availbale to those firms, then data analysis may become impossible.   But those things are nurturing right now. As you said it would take atleast 10 yrs for them to reach popularity. In my point of view, Data Science, Big data and Deep Learning will definitely have an upward trend in this decade.    Who knows what could be brought to the table for the next decade.",True
