@dheerajkura5914,2021-02-09T20:44:21Z,1,"This is really a nice explanation about experience , but few things need to be added  -Emphasis is more on algorithms and hyperparameter tuning, but what about data cleansing/Feature Engineering ..which consumes most of time in creating ML/DS project ..... Giving weightage for an interview candidate only on ML knowledge / hyperparameter tuning is bit a biased approach ... probably getting to know the problem solving capability of a candidate right from understanding business problem, sourcing data, data cleansing, model building,metric selection and interpretation capability would the key Points to consider in a potential candidate  - Hyperparameter tuning has given more weightage ... But is there any set rule to use the combination of hyperparameter tuning..?? It's completely depends upon the data and it's patterns , need to try multiple approach , ML knowledge will help in identifying right hyperparamers  ..so again emphasise put more on ML but not on problem solving skills   - Also, while Interviewing a candidate , it's necessary to ask and understanding what value creation has provided to business either in terms of cost savings/reduced resolution time , ROI  given the business problem  -Model interpretability capability of a candidate should also be considered , which Will be easy to understand how good the candidate is good at solving/ communicating complex problems  In short, Datascience / ML is not just  a traditional IT job ... One has to be creative enough to solve business problem with the domain knowledge creative thinking and ofcourse coding , all together which suits the experience bracket   Datascience/ML should be seen as automating the process of decision making with intelligence coming from data",True
