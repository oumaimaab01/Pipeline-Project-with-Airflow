You gave an example of a fraudulent transaction. Now, an outlier indeed is a hint that the transaction was fraud. If I remove all transactions at the first place, how am i going to achieve my results?  2. You did not explain how do we perform outlier checks with multivariate dataset. Suppose IRIS dataset.

@econdoc3000,2020-07-16T08:27:21Z,1,"Hi Krish, your definition of quantiles is wrong! If you have 0.1=F(x) with F() being the cumulative density, then its 0.1 = F(x)=P(X<=x) NOT P(X<x). So the ""1"" in your example is the 10% quantile, because 10% of data is smaller OR EQUAL to 1. Equally, the 10 is the 100% quantile because 100% of the data is smaller or equal to 10.",True
