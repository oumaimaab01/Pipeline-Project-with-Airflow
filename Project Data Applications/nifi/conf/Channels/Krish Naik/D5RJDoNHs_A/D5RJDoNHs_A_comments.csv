@khwabvachhani2100,2020-12-10T13:52:43Z,1,"Hello, I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me.   My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",True

@VVV-wx3ui,2019-08-21T14:13:00Z,20,"Applied Mathematics and Statistics is what makes this journey of Leaning ML and DL, fasinating at least to me. In School just went thru for passing marks but here learning to solve a business problem. Well said and put it Krish Ji, approach is not to learning Maths and Stats theories but learn what is underlying in an Algorithm. Examples, Linear Algebra (maxima and minima)  is in Gradient Structures. Stats Probability is behind Naive Bayes Algorithm etc   KrishJi, can you please cover topics like  1) L2 and L1 Regularizations. When to use what or significance of each 2) Standardization and Normalization: when to use what.  3) may be my personal interest is, for a given problem/Use case, how to find (Approach) the best suitable algorithm. For example, for a small data set, classification problem, best is Naive Bayes as it was found to be Stable and insensitive to Variation in data.  4) Best Algorithm for Clustering model: is it K-means always ?    Hoping to hear back from you on these. Look forward for your post. Thanks Much. Good Bless Us All.   Update on 22ndAug: Apologies Krish, i should have checked all your videos and Playlists. 3 and 4) points above are already covered by you months time ago. I will go thru each video to solidify my learning. In a months' time from now, i want to be ready for interviews. Hope you will consider my points 1) and 2) points. Thanks much!!! Namaskar Krish.
