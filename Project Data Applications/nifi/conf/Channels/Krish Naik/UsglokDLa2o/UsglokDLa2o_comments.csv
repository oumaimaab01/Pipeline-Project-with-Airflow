@mahammadraffee6920,2020-05-04T07:17:35Z,0,"Categorical Data  Categorical data represents characteristics. Therefore it can represent things like a person‚Äôs gender, language etc. Categorical data can also take on numerical values (Example: 1 for female and 0 for male). Note that those numbers don‚Äôt have mathematical meaning.  Numerical Numerical data, on the other hand, as its name suggests, represents numbers. It is further divided into two subsets: discrete and continuous. Discrete Data Discrete data can usually be counted in a finite matter. Examples Take the number of children that you want to have. Even if you don‚Äôt know exactly how many, you are absolutely sure that the value will be an integer. So a number like 0, 1, 2, or even 10.  Continuous Data It‚Äôs easier to understand discrete data by saying it‚Äôs the opposite of continuous data. Continuous data is infinite, impossible to count, and impossible to imagine. refer : https://365datascience.com/numerical-categorical-data/",True
