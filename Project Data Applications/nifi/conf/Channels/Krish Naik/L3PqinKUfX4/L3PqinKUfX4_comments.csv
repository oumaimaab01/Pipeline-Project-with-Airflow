@gunamrit,2024-02-28T15:16:17Z,0,I used to sleep in stats class and finally i woke up ,True
@tbc6583,2023-08-23T04:38:59Z,0,Great explanation 😀,True
@020hamza2,2022-11-20T03:57:30Z,0,Please don't say I explained in previous video otherwise we have to go there to understand,True
@sudiptasaha3531,2022-05-27T07:20:29Z,7,"Hi Krish, just a small correction 15:32 of this video. As from Z table you are getting whole area of the left side of +3, so left side tail also will be inside the area you are getting. As total area of the bell curve is =1 and for two tailed test same amount of tail area 0.0113 will be on left side of -3.  So total area of CI  interval will be 1-(0.0113+0.0113)=0.9774.   Also P value will be =0.0113+0.0113=0.0226.",True
@karanmalhotra8463,2022-02-17T03:58:20Z,1,Here comparing the P-value with Significance Value is contradicting with the lecture of the Community Session of Stats class 6 at time 1:23:40. Please Krish clarify again with example else it would be a forever confusion for many like me.,True
@Golftrick,2022-02-08T13:52:15Z,0,"Thanks for your clear explanation! Maybe it's convenient to add that the P value is the probability that you see the data, given the fact that your null hypothesis is true. So, how smaller the p value, how smaller the chance that your null hypothesis could be true. Happy coding ! :)",True

@niveditamaity5648,2022-01-31T07:42:05Z,0,Hi Krish. I am Student of Bio Science. Now I’m working with a reputed bank as MIS corordinator. I want to learn Data Science. But unable to get from where I should start. Please suggest,True
@shalinigobinath9224,2022-01-30T17:17:50Z,0,"sir, can you please do 7 day machine learning like how you did 7 days stats. Because of time conflict I could not attend the live session but I did go over the recording daily .very great efforts and very helpful 7 day session.",True
@shalinigobinath9224,2022-01-30T17:15:58Z,0,"Thanks Krish Sir for the P- Value, significance value  and based on that to accept or reject . Very clear explanation.",True
@alihassan-us7mw,2022-01-30T15:01:08Z,6,Thanks alot krish. I have done Masters in applied Statistics domain. But i never find any teacher in my life who has explained these concepts like this. I have attended your live stats community session that was quite amazing. Keep it up you are doing tremendous job.,True
@43210m,2022-01-30T11:32:50Z,8,"Hi sir,0.0113 corresponds to the area to the right side of 3, but by dividing by 2 Reduces the area,it means it doesn't corresponds to the area for z-score=3 so  is the following right:  0.0113 is the area to the right side of 3, same area lies in the left side of 3, so 0.0113+0.0113+middle area =1",True
@DimriAkshat007,2022-01-30T11:30:53Z,1,Start ml community session,True
@govindraju9586,2022-01-30T09:46:58Z,2,"HI Krish, Your are teaching is awsome and easy to follow. I have subscribed to 1 neuron.  Can we calculate Aree under curve  , Ac = (1 + CL) / 2 (1+0.95)/2 = 0.975 = > 0.975  Not sure, if this will work for one tail/2 tail",True
@kuldipdhokiya7733,2022-01-30T08:00:15Z,4,Just one dream in life that's to meet krish naik and thank him 🙏,True
@RaviSingh-xx2wq,2022-01-30T07:08:01Z,1,What if our z score is greater than 3? How we will calculate the P- Value?,True
@biswajitdutta762,2022-01-30T05:05:03Z,1,Great great sir thank you 💖,True
@Fly_High.N,2022-01-30T04:08:07Z,2,Sir when will be the new batch of full stack data science program is starting,True
@prakashdalvi9598,2022-01-30T03:59:10Z,1,Sir please make playlist on SAS also,True
@AstroidegitaTech,2022-01-30T03:58:51Z,1,Thanks for continuous impartations,True
