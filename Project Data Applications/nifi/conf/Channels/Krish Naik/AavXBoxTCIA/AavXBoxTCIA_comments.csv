@johnnyfry2,2020-04-23T20:04:40Z,0,"Thanks for the advice Krish.  I've worked extremely hard to understand Machine Learning, in all facets and all NN types.  I'd say I'm quite comfortable with even many advanced concepts.  Coding though...it's a task.  I'd rather work on the tedious math of backward propagation algo then do coding, hah.   What you are stating here reminds me once when watching a python instructor quite early in my youtube exploration.  She stated the same in her class and when literally asked a coding syntax question she didn't know the answer to, she said, ""well, let's google it"" and openly admitted that all programmers do this on projects.  It was a relief to hear that from her.   Keep up the good work Krish.  I'd love to hear your advice on data engineering and how you work through a database, even if just in broad strokes, there is always something new to pick up.  Otherwise, keep up the good work, I admire your passion and honesty.",True

This is not like any other domain, the information  germinated in computer science is 100x more than any other domain. Millions of programmers are working every day finding different engineering solutions and techniques. As an individual its very hard or almost impossible to catch up with this volume of information . So an automation tool for work flow is very information. So its a wise decision to keep our ego aside and google it and learn about it and build from it. This this solutions could teach you is enormous thats why we have formed several community . Recently i was going through Krish Naik github its really a good resource for ML .
