@surendranathreddy4202,2021-11-29T02:25:43Z,0,"thanks krish naik for the wonderful tutorial on prophet algorithm, my doubt is how can we set yhat_upper and yhat_lower as the threshold values to give an anomaly notification when the data points are deviated from the actual trend or exceeding the lower and upper limits is it possible in prophet algorithm.  thanks in advance",True

@yogeshs-hz1mh,2021-05-21T18:53:07Z,0,Hi krish... Thanks for the video and for the effort u r putting through.  I would like to ask a question and my question the dataset used is a monthly only one and at the end we are forecasting for each day of an year and during the cross validation also we have used days however our training data doesn't contain dates rather we have months only... Then how can we interpret the cross validation???   Hope am clear about my doubt.. Expecting a response... Thankd,True
@JeanMartinezEspaillat,2021-05-20T05:50:55Z,0,"you know that the 'fb' in 'fbprophet' stands for 'FaceBook'  . Right???  because when you type ""facebook fbprophet"" youre basically saying facebook twice  ok ?",True

@attilajuhasz8,2021-04-02T08:55:02Z,1,"Hi Krish, correct me if im wrong but according to this blog post: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/time-series-forecasting-using-facebook-prophet-library-in-python/ Prophet can handle any kind of (stationary / non stationary) time-series data (we dont have to shift).",True

@vishaldas6346,2020-11-16T14:59:01Z,0,"Hi Krish, one correction please use :- "" future_dates=model.make_future_dataframe(periods=12,freq='MS')"", this will make the data similar to the original CSV record.",True
@rohankhurana4934,2020-10-12T11:42:04Z,0,In my case I have a dataset of request volume. I want to predict expected request for next 3 months. Do I fit the model based on daily frequency and predict month or shall I use monthly frequency only,True
@sojibmustafiz4830,2020-09-19T18:17:04Z,0,Everything is ok. Don’t drink coffee with sound in the time of making tutorial. This sound is disgusting to me. I don’t know about other person.,True

@krithiksworld6526,2020-07-19T11:54:39Z,0,"Sir, can you please tell me datasets for cloud computing",True
@Avi-ol7xl,2020-07-19T10:09:49Z,4,"The forecast you showed is daily, however, the data that we had is monthly. I think it's not right because you have used monthly data where the model only understands that it has value for every 1st of the month and overfit other values. I suppose there is a high posterior variance in between, You should have changed frequency in making forecast data frame to represent monthly forecast. Could have made more sense. Happy Learning :)",True
@yuvii007,2020-07-19T06:23:59Z,0,can you do a lecture on multivariate time series? For eg. we have filters in our plant which gets dirty after some time and needs cleaning. Getting dirty depends on other variable and it changes over time so I am not sure if we should use regression or time series forecasting for such output.,True
