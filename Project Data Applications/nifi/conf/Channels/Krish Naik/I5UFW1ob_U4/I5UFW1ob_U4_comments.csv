This says a lot about their management expertise over decades or so. EU companies have stopped hiring but didn't fire employees in a way MAANG did. In can be subject of debate I know but the way US and EU treats their citizens are 180 degree apart.  Having said this many overseas candidates got laid off on the day of joining and within 6 months of working (Germany) because of Ukraine war and oil scenario and even there, US companies fired EU candidates but tight employment rules will compensate their loss during tough time.  Indian government should do something for their own tax payers rather than dirty politics so to protect employees against such situations.",True

I completed my Bachelor's degree in computer science and opted out of the Masters plan because of financial issues. I'm learning everything by myself. At least those are laid off they have experience in large companies but for freshers we are not getting that much attention laid off. It feels like danger when I think about my off campus journey. Although I'm upskilling myself every week, what is the point if i don't get interview chances. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.  Please make a video special for freshers  and recession.
