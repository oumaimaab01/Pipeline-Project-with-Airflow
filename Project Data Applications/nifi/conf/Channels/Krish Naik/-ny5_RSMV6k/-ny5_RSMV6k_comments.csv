@rekhavs3779,2023-12-27T06:29:31Z,9,"My question here is, does this kind of API's will it replace the traditional model building that data scientist do as part of their work. Because these kind of API's are more flexible enough we can restructure it based on the need & use case. Model training with right param is the super duper part in the lyf of data scientist (ML developer or whatever title we call). Say if that get replaced with these sort of Big LLM's for NLP and in future expecting more like this for CV. how can we see the job role (like day to day work) of data scientist in upcoming years.   Because I was working for one of my client back in 2021 to extract info from resumes, where we struggled a lot to extract the semantics from those unstructed doc. now its easy-peasy just a one click do wonders. if this was present back then lot of research work gets reduced and development would have been completed in a week with just 3 engineers, where in we where 6 at that point of time. (Looking scary these reduces 50% of work force) & recent paytm layoff adds fuel to this fire as well.  krish really need your thoughts here.",True
