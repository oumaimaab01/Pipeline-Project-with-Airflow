@shwetaeknathnaik6544,2023-05-04T12:28:52Z,1,"couple of questions:  1. Ideally in agile methodology we do build and test in one sprint itself and not do test of sprint 1 with Sprint 2 build. Is the above process exception for AI based projects?  2. What about the estimations?  its not possible to do all 5 stories in one sprint can it? it totally depends on the effort so how do we do estimations in AI based projects?  3. in Data science, if you are in exploration phase then the estimations can be tricky, it will be more of spikes so which agile framework is suggested as I feel scrum might be a failure over here 4. How does one document user stories for data science projects? what are the guidelines.  5. what all testing is done for data science projects?",True

@CrashTheGooner,2021-06-26T07:14:24Z,3,"Future is using many ML platforms which help you manage it's entire life cycle! Data Pipelines for Continues Training, Continues Deployment, gauging accuracy, and a RestAPI for accessing.. Software engineering is the same but usess different set of tools although some may be used for ML as well.. So basically Kafka /Spark/MapR for data enginering, KubeFlow Mlflow Airflow for CT CD pipelines and model management, SCM for code collaboration, Platform is mostly Kubernetes, Ezmeral, Seldon, etc Container monitoring stack like ELK or Prometheus Grafana stack..",True
@digidim,2021-06-26T07:09:55Z,24,"I understand that the Agile might be used by many companies for implementing DS projects. But this only works when you have something tangible to implement. As a larger part of a DS project might be experimenting with different methodologies it becomes difficult to estimate timeline for a task. In order to deal with this issue during experimentation phase we can take a hybrid approach between Kanban and Agile. So how this would work is during the experimentation phase we plan using Kanban and when we have something tangible to implement and deploy, we switch to Agile framework.",True
