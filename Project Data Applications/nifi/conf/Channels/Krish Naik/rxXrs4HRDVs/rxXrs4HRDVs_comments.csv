@madunishant6052,2019-08-17T05:03:41Z,2,"Hey Krish! Got few questions  1. While doing feature selection you said we use Correlation, Heatmaps and other techniques but how do we visualize correlation if we have 100 or more features? I heard we use a technique called PCA for dimensionality reduction to reduce features isn‚Äôt it true?  2. Regarding the imbalanced dataset - let‚Äôs suppose taking the iris dataset as reference if I have 20 setosa and 60 versicolor records which are the dependent variables then we call them as an imbalanced dataset does imbalanced dataset only applies for dependent variables or does the same rule apply for independent variables too?",True
