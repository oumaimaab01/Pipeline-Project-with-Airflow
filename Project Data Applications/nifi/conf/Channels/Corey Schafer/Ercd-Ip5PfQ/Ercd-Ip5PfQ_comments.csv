@coreyms,2019-06-18T15:10:36Z,94,I hope everyone finds this video helpful. The next video of the series will be posted tomorrow at the same time. The next video will cover subplots. Subplots are used to work with plots in a more object-oriented manner and also allow us to plot multiple different graphs at the same time.  I'd like to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this series.

What argument (if any) are we passing to this function when we call it. How is the animate function actually being called by what seems to be the animate argument for FuncAnimation. Why is the FuncAnimation function assigned to the variable Ani; We don't seem to use Ani anywhere else. Thanks,True

@user-yc9td4wb2c,2019-06-24T01:13:26Z,0,if i type the file name in CMD it doesn't find it so i wrote the path and it started printing to CMD the data but the csv file was never created so when i run the script the plot is empty and doesn't update. if i run the python file from VS code then the csv is generated and everything works fine. so what's the reason it doesn't work with CMD?,True

@bokkenka,2019-06-18T18:24:58Z,16,"Nice videos.  A tip for this one that might be useful: You can slice the data follow only the last X number of entries rather than seeing all the data bunch up tighter and tighter.  Let's say you only care about the last minute...  Add a `[-60:]` on the end of the `x=...`, `y1=...`, and `y2=...` lines.",True

@coreyms,2019-06-18T15:10:36Z,94,I hope everyone finds this video helpful. The next video of the series will be posted tomorrow at the same time. The next video will cover subplots. Subplots are used to work with plots in a more object-oriented manner and also allow us to plot multiple different graphs at the same time.  I'd like to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this series.

@Iknowpython,2019-06-18T15:09:21Z,5,One of the main reason why python is one of the best is because of its huge community contributing in creating libraries and matplotlib is definitely one of the finest library for data visualization,True
