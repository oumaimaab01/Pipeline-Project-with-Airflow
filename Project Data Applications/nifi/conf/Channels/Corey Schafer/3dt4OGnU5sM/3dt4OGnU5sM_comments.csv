@DM-py7pj,2017-04-30T18:22:42Z,0,"Excellent video.  i am following a tutorial on time series forecasting that has the following lines of code:  dateparse = lambda dates: pd.datetime.strptime(dates, '%Y-%m') data = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\AirPassengers.csv', parse_dates=[0], index_col = 'Month', date_parser = dateparse)  I was wondering if it is possible to use a list comprehension for the date_parser function?  I had tried: dates = ['1949-04', '1949-05'] dates_list = [pd.datetime.strptime(dates, '%Y-%m') for date in dates] print(dates_list)  However, i get the following:  TypeError: strptime() argument 1 must be str, not list  Is there a way around this to allow conversion of each date value in a column from e.g. 1949-04' to '1949-04-01 00:00:00' using list comprehension? I appreciate that here a function  is being called.",True

@insanecbrotha,2017-02-01T10:55:28Z,0,the dict comprehension works also with something like this (this was my first idea when I read the verbose task description): : fullname_dict = {names[i]: heros[i] for i in range(len(names))}  Unlike the given solution this throws an IndexError if the iterables don't have the same len though.. :(,True

@Pd69bq,2016-04-12T09:29:50Z,0,"for the dict/hash comprehension, imo using dict function is shorter and easier. especially in python 3 since zip returns its own ""zip type"". although, you still can unpack returns with the same way, but type less is alway good, right?",True
