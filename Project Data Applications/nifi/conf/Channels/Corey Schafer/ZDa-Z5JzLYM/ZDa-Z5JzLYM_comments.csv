@markkennedy9767,2023-07-28T19:18:28Z,0,"I can see how objects and instances can be so confusing for people. First off, I understand why people find the self parameter confusing: it basically insists that when we send the object itself as an argument to the parameter self when we call the class for the first time that this object exists (which it doesn't because the instance hasn't been created from the class until we send the argument to self).   Apart from that, all the aliasing (not sure if that's the correct term) going on is confusing: so basically when we call the class to create the instance, we do this by sending arguments which are ""aliased"" with parameters (blackboxes) which carry the information about the arguments to the right side of any assignments in the body of the class, which are assigned to variables which are created from a parameter (self, which we are not free to make up) dotted with a name we are free to make up.

I just want to share 1 thing from goolge for those who might have some difficulties with the word instance.    *An instance, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation.  Each time a program runs, it is an instance of that program. In languages that create objects from classes, an object is an instantiation of a class. That is, it is a member of a given class that has specified values rather than variables. In a non-programming context, you could think of ""dog"" as a class and your particular dog as an instance of that class.*",True

Just curious... In one of the videos I previously watch, they try to rename the attributes with a leading underscore.  like:      def __init__(self, first, last, pay):         self._first = first         self._last = last         self._pay = pay The video says to avoid name clash with the method of the same name, and we already have an attribute called ""first"" and we don't want to replace it.  There's a widely followed convention that the implementation details of an object, which are not intended for consumption or manipulation by clients of the object should be prefixed with an underscore.",True

To spend 40 years trying to figure out the meaning of one piece of syntax, and then succeeding, only to have never made any money during those 40 years because all one did was try to figure out what that one piece of syntax does or means, is the understatement of understatements of Pyrrhic Victory.  I honestly now hate it more and learn and understand less of it now than at any earlier point in my life. At least taking formal community college courses got me to understand and do something with programming.  But literally there exists absolutely nothing PRACTICAL that one can do with computer programming in ANY language outside doing formal college course work for a teacher.  I mean, sure, just to make the codehead morons & idiots happy whose entire life is wrapped up in fetishizing and worshipping and oohing and aahing at one language using a period and another language using a ? mark to delimit a command or whatever, believe it's the greatest thing since farming & anesthesia when I figure out how to get one line to work, before getting stopped for the next 10 years by the next 200 lines of code. To teach me programming, you would have to personally live with me and work with me every day for 10 years, and pay me $30,000 a year to do this thing I hate.   Best to stick to proving mathematical theorems.  At least, when one finally triumphs after 30 years trying to solve that, one has added new deep original knowledge to the collective knowledge of humans.",True

If you are going to have a program that talks about a PS4, then eh. But if your talking about consoles AND PS4s, then you‚Äôre talking about a type of thing, and a thing, so perhaps you should use a class.   It seems that there are types of data, and functions (blocks of code) we can use on these specific types of data. It seems like both, types of data, and associated functions are chosen arbitrary, so we can make our own of both. We can make our own types of data (classes), and their corresponding functions (methods).

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-08T07:34:33Z,6,"Summary: Using classes help us to group data and functions in a logical way. Data and functions that are associated with a class are respectively called an attribute and method for the class. Classes are the blueprint of the instances, while instances are the specific case of an class.   To create attributes of a class, use the special init method. (Special methods are methods that require the double underscore, '__' besides it)   There are 2 ways to use a method. First is calling the method by 'first typing the class name, period, and typing the method name' in this case, we have to type in the 'self' argument manually. The second is using the '.method()' way after the name of the instance. In this case, the self argument is passed in automatically.",True

You can have any additional parameters thereafter? using __Init__ is the constructor for a class. the self parameter refers to an instance of the object? I kind of get it but really don't know how to describe it on my own. have been looking for simple ways to explain it, which in turn can help me better understand it. To me I get being told that it is best to do it this way, but not having a complete understanding on it can be a struggle when you aren't able to describe something in my opinion so if anyone has some input or pointers to best explained the Python Constructor (classes i get, methods, functions) I greatly appreciate it.

@codebreakeruk6533,2019-06-26T11:09:50Z,0,"Some questions:   In other languages, is self = this? Also is the purpose of the 'constructor' 'self' so that when you pass (parse?) the class through an array from a database or other such input, that you can do foreach array fill attr/meths with array data and the result would be emp1, emp2 etc?   If so, I don't really understand why on earth it has been so hard for me to understnad it simply as a class is a skeleton that wears clothes after being put throught he conveyer belt... (ignoring any unique attr/meths a particular object might need)   I've struggled to understand OOP because of the 'constructor' a stupid name IMO, I find this init naming convention a lot more palatable. essentially ""on load of this class, set these things"" therefore you've reserved the memory space for that object rather than having to crete them yourself later, as explained in the video...

@12345charliebrown,2018-11-28T08:10:24Z,0,"just managed to get myself out of the OOP mindset after years of wasting my time with it, and I've gone back to procedural based coding. There are very few times where abstraction is used and when it is, I find the library written in OOP over complicated and over engineered. A warning to those starting out in Python or Programming in general, you'll find lots of tutorials based around OOP like this video. On the surface it makes sense and the logical thing to do is to wrap everything in a class but in real world coding it's a massive piiful. Take the OOP tutorials with a pinch of salt.   I'm not dissing Corey himself, I think his videos are very helpful and Ive have brushed up on some of my Python skills watching his videos but the Object Oriented Programming side is a waste. Most of you will never need to know what Abstraction and Polymorphism is or will ever have to use it. Imagine having to wade through 4 sub level classes to find that do_something() has no relation to that sub class and could quite easily have been made into a function.

@tonyquigley6543,2018-11-06T20:18:16Z,0,"Hi Corey can i ask you a question, why does every single one of these Java or Python videos basically make nothing?  What i mean by that is, when people envision being a programmer, they imagine making their own program, with menus and buttons and shit to click on and fields to fill in and drop down menus etc, but literally every single Python or Java (or any language for that matter) just teaches you what a string is, what a short or long is, and how to assign a value to piece of data and to store it.  Like adding names and ages to an array etc. But it's all in the Python compiler (or Java) window, and it's boring as hell, how come not one person has come on here and gone ""Hey, you see this cool little program i have here that you can launch fro your desktop, and it can search your computer for any files you want, you just select the dowon menus and this tab and that tab and blah blah"". Do you get me? Because If i hear one more person say ""the best way to learn is just to ignore the tutorials and just sit there and try to code"".  But the problem is, thats impossible, as we're basically stuck, completely limited to that little Output window after you click the green arrow.   I mean, do people really consider the fact that they just spent 40 minutes going through a bunch of strings and ints and how to link them to values etc, all to press the green button to get an ourput underneath that says ""Orange, 141, Orange and Green, Orange, Green and Purple, 2948, Your answer was correct, your answer was incorrect""   Do you get me? Im not gonna sit there after this 45 min lesson and think, ""Ok thats awesome, now i can use the principle of this, and i can start to build my own little desktop application using the same resources as he was using, i can change certain things and instead of drop down boxes, i can have check boxes, and neat warning window that came up, i could totally customize that to do this and that"".   What you've really shown us (an i promise I'm not directing this specifically at you man) is how to type in expressions and how to print them in a box underneath without any errors.  Man thats not programing or being creative, thats what everyon else did.  How are we supposed to take the knowlege you/they gave us from that ""int myResource = 2 +3; "" and go ahead and build a desktop application, that when you open it, it asks you for your phone number and password you use to log into your phone providers online text messaging service for you without you having to go to the website yourself etc...   Show me how to make an external program, with boxes, and windows and menus.   I love what you're doing, just please expand for us, we know all this small stuff., If you're to be more successful, we need to know how to ACTUALLY make a program, where to get external data and forms and boxes and windows etc. Not like i sais ""myValueOne + myValueTwo = Result;"" you know?   Again, I love you, but let's go man!!!",True

How do you get the method to print when the instance e.g. emp_1 is unknown and the number of them is unknown too?   In other terms, I would like to wright a mini-program where the user inputs the name of a subject he needs to take for an exam (plus the number of pages he needs to study etc...) and then a loop runs until he has finished inputing all of the subjects he needs to take so the name of those subjects (e.g. Maths, History etc...) is an unknown and so is the number of them.

@grahammuir6296,2017-10-26T10:31:38Z,1,Your explanations are first class. I have always believed that it makes a big difference when you can make the subject relate-able.

The teacher on Udemy is very intelligent and a great coder but sometimes fails to make the subject relate-able. I would pay to learn from you about Python.

@kdeuler,2017-10-15T03:59:14Z,0,"Corey, I have a basic newbie question on instantiation: What are the advantages, in the greater OOP programming environment, of instantiating a programmer-defined class more than once?  Say I have a ""Movies"" class. Each instance of the class is a list containing a movie title, and perhaps a sublist of actors in the movie. Let's say that I instantiated several movie objects. My question is, then what? What could I do with all these instances? I could print them out, and perhaps compare them in some ways. But how is instantiation in OOP better than manipulating a pointer in a database with functional programming. It seems to me that a program can really only deal with a set of movie information one at a time, so why fill up memory with objects?  Thanks in advance!   And as others have written, great series of lectures. So glad I found them. A comfortably fast pace. Thanks for the hard work.",True

He just told us to ""make sure we knew what it was"", literally never mentioning how to create one, the function of them, or anything.

@jmack6046,2016-10-14T05:18:40Z,9,"I've been learning Python as my first language for a few months now, but I got stuck and couldnt' grasp the concept  of OOP via Python. I started leaning OOP through books in Ruby, and I felt like the way it is presented in Ruby is SO much easier to comprehend compared to Python. I guess there's a reason why OOP is usually introduced within the first three chapters of any Ruby textbook (forgiving syntax/true object oriented language) vice Python which teaches OOP in much much later chapters. At any rate, once I understood the basics of OOP in Ruby (took like 2-3days).. the transition to Python OOP was pretty easy.. It's essentialy all the same besides some terminology differences.
