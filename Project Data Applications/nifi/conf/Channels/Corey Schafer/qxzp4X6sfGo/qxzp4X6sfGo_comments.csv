@kprenesti,2015-11-12T18:56:32Z,0,"Thank you!!! I've been working my way through FreeCodeCamp and I've just been so stuck when it came to these array methods, especially the ones with callback functions.  I really appreciate you walking through what each parameter in the callback function referred to and how to use them.  This helped a LOT, more than Treehouse and FCC combined.  I can't wait to see your other tutorials.  You have a new subscriber in me!",True
