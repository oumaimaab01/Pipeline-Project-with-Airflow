Obviously all the videos are great, but my biggest challenge is learning how to solve problems in a project, so I like the videos where we can see your thought process and code you try before you get to the final version.   I don't know if it's in the works, but it would be awesome to have a series on doing a full system where it's maybe white-boarded with requirements, possibly also showing the web front-end being planned out with wire frame for Django/Flask, and then walking through steps, iterations, testing, documentation, making available for the client, and then how to handle updates/changes, etc.  A man can dream!",True

@SusanAmberBruce,2018-12-22T19:30:34Z,1,"In answer to your question about what does anyone think about a video like this, I think it's good to see a face, that human thing now and again. The format of your tutorials is excellent. For me what would be really useful on top of all the videos  that show how to use the nuts and bolts of python, would be a couple of videos to give some idea of, say for example how to turn a programming problem into a class, I don't know if that's a thing you would want to do? my estimation of what I have seen available on Utube is lots of videos on the nuts and bolts stuff, (don't get me wrong, yours are excellent and very useful), videos on how to approach a problem, writing psuedo code in fact, seem to be a bit thin on the ground.",True

@FrankLi92,2018-09-20T06:06:05Z,0,"What other topics are in the works?! Sneak peek perhaps? I personally am interested in learning what coding in the real work world looks like. Most tutorials seem to handhold you and do something along the lines of ""hello world."" While not inherently bad, I think it makes me, a student, nervous because I'm not sure what to expect at my first job or internship.   Since you've worked as a programmer before, it would be cool to see you point out things in tutorials that we need to focus on or how something you do in the tutorial might not always be the same as what you see on the job. Maybe you can do a ""replica"" project of something similar to what you've actually shipped before in your career. I believe that knowing someone who got paid to make something similar would give me a tremendous amount of confidence if I could understand the material. It'll give me a good gauge of where I should be and where I currently am.  For future topics if you haven't already planned them, it'd be awesome to learn data science/ML topics. You're one of the few people who can condense difficult concepts into digestible and sensible bites, so if I'm going to learn it, I really hope it would be you!  Cheers!",True

I consider myself to be in between the newb to the intermediate python programmer. I watched a few of the OOP videos and enjoyed them very much. You are easy to understand and you don't put information in your videos that you are not going to discuss and apply in that same video. One of my main issues in finding good tutor using tutorials is that a lot of instructors will talk about something you can do and only give tidbits and then say 'don't worry about that now it will be discussed in a future video', then you have to wait 10 different tutorials later just to get back to that information. It becomes frustrating to get small pieces of information and have no clue what they are talking about only to be told don't worry about it now. I'm hoping to be a patron soon and hoping your content can put me in the path of getting my first programming job.

All the videos of yours that I have seen are tuned perfectly to the industry standards. People watching them won't go wrong anywhere. Videos have correct pace; Neither slow nor fast. I myself have seen many websites and answers on Quora that include your videos as material for many topics. (I found your videos exactly like this)  2. Your statement - ""People should have free access to knowledge and education"". This won me over. Not many people can pay for courses when they themselves are starting on path of learning and earning. No one knows whether they will find any particular course helpful and satisfying until they themselves take it. You have taken a very bold but brilliant step which I feel will earn you great rewards later on.  Lastly best luck for all of your endeavors.   P.S - I liked this conversation format for a video. It is helpful when discussing topics that don't require writing codes and seeing output or explaining some concepts.",True

One thing I think you should consider is a weekly/monthly/whateverly AMA/Ask Corey session, where you answer highly liked comments or pick and choose your own that you feel would be beneficial for other viewers to see answered. I know a couple of tutorial groups that do something similar (shoutout to filmriot, role models for my hobby and passion for filmmaking) and it works REALLY well for them!   Also: I've been following the flask series, and I was wondering if you might be able to point me in the direction of more detailed information regarding how to gain an in depth understanding of the content that you cover, along with best practices and conventions for Flask, HMTL/CSS etc. I'm highly interested in learning the right way to do things, thanks!",True

@elephant742,2018-06-27T07:42:14Z,2,"Hey Corey, your videos are amazing man. I have learnt a lot from your tutorial series and python in general. I have been learning web development on my own for quite some time and your Flask tutorial series have been a great help in the process. Currently in the process of building a CMS platform and I must thank you and your videos for that.   I just had a small request. Could you do a tutorial series on JavaScript for front end developement ? I have lil bit of knowledge when it comes to vanilla JS and jQuery but it turns out everyone out there is using frameworks like React , Vue and Angular. It would be really helpful if you would create a video series for amy JS framework. There are not many good tutorial dedicated for front end developement , so I think if you cover that it would be really helpful.   Thanks and regards , Dev.",True

@silvanoteneyck2911,2018-06-27T06:15:25Z,37,"Your videos have really helped me out a lot.  I've gone through most of the beginning Python set and am now working on your Flask series.  There are lots of instructional videos out there on programming and python.  I'd like to take a block of this comment section to explain what I think you are doing right because I see so many poorly made videos out there.  First: You talk fast.  Not crazy fast but you enunciate well, you get right to the point and you don't spend any time 'um'ing and 'uh'ing.  Second: You prepare.  Using your prewritten code snippets in lieu of having us watch you slowly type out code is a huge deal.  This makes the videos watchable and even exciting as the material is being delivered at a good rate.  It also keeps the videos short and manageable.  Third: You edit.  It's clear that you take the time to review these videos before you release them.  I only know that because so many YouTubers obviously don't.  Again this keeps the videos to a manageable length while keeping the pace steady enough that I never feel like I'm wasting time.  Fourth:  You know your stuff.  It's also clear you take the time to make sure you know what you are talking about and you organize the material so it is not overwhelming but still a good pace of delivery.  I personally prefer watching the material and listening to staring at someone's head.  But such a conversational style as you put it may be right for certain content.  Congratulations on your YouTube award.  I think you've earned it.  I look forward to your future videos and will continue to enjoy your posted content.  Cheers.",True

Having the opportunity to hang around viewing your videos more often now that you are going in full-time means that you will have a positive impact for many, many people... including me for sure! I can only thank you for your kindness, generosity and open attitude. I would consider myself quite broke at the moment and even though I experience some guilt benefiting from your excellent work without giving back for now, you can be assured that you will be the first person I will be spending my money on with Patreon once I can lend a better job (thanks in good part to your great instructional videos!).  I will be more than happy to hear you talk about whatever subject you come up with, but I must be honest: I really hope you will be continuing your journey teaching Python like a pro. I mean, just keep it the way it is! I know there are many resources out there teaching that language, but nobody comes close to the quality you provide. You have a way to go more in depth while keeping the stuff very interesting with real examples and it shows you know what you are doing. You always have snippets ready to explain concepts in a way that suddenly makes more sense!
