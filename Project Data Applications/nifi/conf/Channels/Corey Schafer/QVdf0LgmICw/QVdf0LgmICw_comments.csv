Is this case true only for immutable objects? Because if I try to change a mutable global object (without declaring it as global) in a function it doesn't create a new object. Please see the example below: Both print statements will output a[1] as 0. a = [1, 2, 3] def fun():     a[1] = 0      print(a) fun() print(a)    My understanding here is ""A new local object is created if we try to assign a value to a immutable global objects inside a function and if we do the same with a mutable object there isn't a  new object created, rather the assignment changes the same global object.""

I have a 'main' module and I have 'classes' module. I import the 'classes' module in the main module but there are many variables initiated in the 'main' module and need access from 'classes'.   1. I tried global but for some reasons it didn't work. 2. People advised me against mutual import. 3. I initiate everything in 'init' module and import that. But don't know how to do that when I am initiating variables at the beginning of my for loop. Should I go with a class and maybe a 'reset' method?,True
