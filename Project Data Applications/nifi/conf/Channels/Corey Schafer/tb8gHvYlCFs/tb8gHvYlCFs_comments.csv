I want this to br running 24/7. I way i got around it, is that i wrote a 'requestes' script that will run every 20 seconds to trigger the 'sms_worker' using time.wait(). It works just fine but i feel this is a dirty workaround. I would like your input about how to run it in a more consistent way.  So sorry about the long comment",True
