@slavoie,2018-11-08T19:38:43Z,20,"23:48 ... Alternative to line continuation with backslashes ‚Üí Using parentheses instead of backslashes I prefer to wrap long lines with parentheses as I find it more readable with less symbols in the end (...depending on the number of wraps!). For this particular case, the Python code with backslashes is the following:  posts = Post.query.filter_by(author=user)\         .order_by(Post.date_posted.desc())\         .paginate(page=page, per_page=5)  Now, we can also use parentheses:  posts = (Post.query.filter_by(author=user)                   .order_by(Post.date_posted.desc())                   .paginate(page=page, per_page=5)          )  I like this way of doing it because you can visually indent everything at exactly the same horizontal position in your file.
