@AugustoGeografo,2020-02-10T16:24:14Z,0,"Dear, Corey Would it be possible for you to develop a tutorial on how to use locale through the data Analysis workflow?

Nonetheless, the intricacies of using locale with pandas and matplotlib are not well covered in any course in English.",True

@finnmccool8671,2020-02-06T23:10:19Z,0,Hi Corey. A way off topic question. Do you ever use inline CSS in markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks for presentation purposes? I mean something like this: <p style='background-color: #99CCCC;            font-size: 22px;            font-weight: bold;            padding: 0.5em'>Introduction</p> Or is there a way to apply a CSS style sheet for the whole notebook?,True

@guyindisguise,2020-02-06T16:52:28Z,2,Does shorter videos mean more videos? Because I like whichever option gives us more total content. ;)  PS: another great video. I've used Pandas for a project in the last few days and your videos have been a tremendous help. Thx Corey,True
