@haliax8013,2020-01-29T10:07:16Z,1,"First of all, thank you so much for your open-source approach and also for making information accessible and free for all. To me, these virtues are very important and admirable.    On the other hand, like Einstein said:    ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.""     And as also like Da Vinci said:    ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.""    So because of that, i firmly believe that the ultimate success in both education and teaching is to simply teach things like a 5 years old can understand. And i believe that this ability is a very rare and exceptional ability that only a few have. Based on the videos of you I watched, I can confidently claim that I have no doubt that you are especially blessed with this ability. Congrats!    If we get to the main point, my current progress is halted because of missing of subtitles in your video. As i have hard of hearing and not being a native-speaker, i rely heavily on subtitles, i just can't understand without them.     So can you please add auto-generated subtitles by YouTube to this video?    Thanks in advance!",True
