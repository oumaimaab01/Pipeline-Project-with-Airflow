@GregZaal,2020-05-12T14:09:56Z,0,"Not sure if you covered this in the video (I just saw the initial code and wanted to point this out): Patreon's tokens automatically expire at the end of every month. So at some point the code will stop working and you'll have to manually get new tokens from their site.... OR, you can add a little more to your code and have it use the `refresh_token` to fetch and store a new access token when it expires. Here's a snippet I use: https://gist.github.com/gregzaal/d7cb6d666a3eda2163843a29429920ec The important part is in the `if isinstance(campaign_response, dict) and campaign_response['errors']:` statement.",True

Please invest in a better mic setup or just leave your edit on the louder side. For the sake of the hearing impaired and those with shitty speakers(both of them are me), I also suggest uploading your script for the closed captions; the autogen isn't always right and things can get confusing. Not here to tell ya how to make videos, and ya don't have to sound like podcast-level audio, but I know lots of people would be thankful. Much love.",True

@coreyms,2020-05-11T06:16:46Z,39,"Hey Everybody, This video is a bit specific to a task I was personally trying to solve, but I wanted to record this because I thought there were some good tips and features that many of you could use in personal projects yourselves. What we cover here is very similar to how we'll be working with other APIs in future videos, so it's definitely good practice. Also, if you're currently a YouTube Member, then I'll be showing how to add your names to the end credits of the videos in the next tutorial when we look at the YouTube API.  Also, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate the support that I receive from all of you. What I cover in this video is just a little extra perk for people who are supporting at a certain tier on Patreon and YouTube, but just know that even by watching the videos it's already a huge help. So if you're not a supporter on Patreon or YouTube then no worries! But if you are interested in having your names included in the credits of my videos, as I showed in this video, then you're welcome to check out my Patreon or YouTube Memberships. Links are in the description of the video. I hope you all had a great weekend! Cheers!",True
