@yileizhang3545,2016-11-14T03:33:08Z,9,"Hi Corey, thanks so much for this tutorial! I learnt a lot. But I also have a question.   I noticed when you were formatting using the dictionary keys, if you are doing  ""..."".format(person[""name""]), then you would have the quotation marks around the key name. However, when you did it this way:  "" ... {0[name]} ..."", you omitted the quotation marks around it.   I did got rid of the quotation marks from the first example as well as adding quotation marks to the second, and I got error. So I guess it's just the way to be. But can you explain to me the logic of this, if there is any at all? Thanks a lot!",True
