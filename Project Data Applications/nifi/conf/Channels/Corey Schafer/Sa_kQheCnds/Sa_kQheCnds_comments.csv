@coreyms,2018-12-13T19:06:55Z,119,"In this video, we set up a Linux server from scratch before we deploy Django, which is what a lot of people have requested. But if you already have a server ready to go then you might not be interested in the setup part. If you'd like to skip the Linux server setup and go straight to the deployment then please skip to 29:11  Just be sure you make the code correction I mention at the 3:00 mark! Anyways, I hope people find this useful. Deployment can be a tricky topic because there are so many different choices (e.g. hosts, operating systems, web servers, etc). These are my preferred choices in this video. Remember, if you'd like to sign up for $20 of credit at Linode then you can use my link to signup: https://promo.linode.com/coreyschafer/",True

I saw some comments already mention this but I didn't see them at the time so I figured I might not be the only one in that situation.  First I faced a 403 issue, which was fixed by changing the file permission of the user directory with below command: sudo chmod 711 /home/YOUR_USERNAME  After that, I could access the website but links and forms were broken: loading forever with no logs from django. So I checked the logs in /var/log/apache2/error.log (if you don't have access, you can use that command: sudo cat /var/log/apache2/error.log) It mentioned I had an issue with wsgi: ""Truncated or oversized response headers received from daemon process"" The solution I found that worked and fixed everything is to add below line at the very bottom of the apache conf file - located at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}  Here you go, hope that helps :)",True

It seems that redhat based distros have an extra layer of security over the home directory. Even if you change the file permissions it still throws up errors and causes no end of trouble.  Also, make sure that you compile the latest mod_wsgi - it seems that if you use the pip install on the centos system, then this is not adequate. If you run into problems, it is best to remove it and follow the steps such as here: www.liquidweb.com/kb/configuring-wsgi-on-ubuntu-centos  Then once the links are set up you can reinstall it in the virtual environment.

Essentially, port 80 is not permitted when using Django as the dev server [ ... runserver 0.0.0.0:80], or the http request is forbidden when using the Apache2 web server.  I tried to follow explicitly what Corey was doing.  It works when using localhost:8000 but nowhere else.  I made sure the firewall did not block http/tcp on port 80, I used netstat utility to verify 80 was open and listening, ping works fine too.  This problem was pretty similar on both Linode and Google Cloud VM.  Google server did not respond at all on port 80, Linode server said I don't have permission for this website.

@sciencecompliance235,2019-08-13T04:20:17Z,1,"Hi Corey, your tutorials are great.  One thing that would make long videos like this better if you feel like putting in the time, though, is putting timestamps in the description for each of the major steps involved in this lengthy and complicated process.  I just built my first website following your Django tutorials and find myself referring back to this video a lot specifically, since a lot of the stuff I just followed to get the website built without really trying to commit too much to memory or fully understanding the concepts.  Replicating this process to build multiple sites (and make a business out of it) or just remembering some of the concepts to manage a Linux server requires deeper study than just following these well-produced tutorials to the t.  It would be much easier to click on timestamps than having to sift through the thumbnails and reference the step of the process in question.  I also feel like a lot of this stuff, while good to go through the process one or a few times to understand what's going on, could easily be automated via a Python script that runs commands through the Bash shell and the server's command line.  As fun as it is to learn back-end web development and feel like a 1337 h4X0R for doing so, some of this stuff would get pretty tedious if you were trying to do web development repeatedly as a business function.",True

@senpos,2018-12-13T19:42:03Z,3,"This process is so boring and repeated for each deployment of Django app :( Isn't it already automated somewhere? It should be easy to deploy with Docker and a predefined Dockerfile, I guess.",True

@coreyms,2018-12-13T19:06:55Z,119,"In this video, we set up a Linux server from scratch before we deploy Django, which is what a lot of people have requested. But if you already have a server ready to go then you might not be interested in the setup part. If you'd like to skip the Linux server setup and go straight to the deployment then please skip to 29:11  Just be sure you make the code correction I mention at the 3:00 mark! Anyways, I hope people find this useful. Deployment can be a tricky topic because there are so many different choices (e.g. hosts, operating systems, web servers, etc). These are my preferred choices in this video. Remember, if you'd like to sign up for $20 of credit at Linode then you can use my link to signup: https://promo.linode.com/coreyschafer/",True
