And for performance they all perform slightly different in some operations. But whether we  should use MSSQL, MySQL or MongoDB is simply an irrelevant question.""

Are you kidding, you reach a point as programmer where the programming language doesn't matter anymore"" Me: ""I can program in 15 different languages, I don't even know what ""CORE languages"" are.
