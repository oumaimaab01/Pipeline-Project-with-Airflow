@MichaelMueller,2020-01-10T10:47:12Z,1,Hello! Just a note from my site: since Mac OS Catalina z-shell is the default shell ... So if you want to use bash you have to configure it to your default shell ... from the commandline: chsh -s /bin/bash After the change and opening a terminal window you get a warning that the default z-shell is not activated. To suppress this message use: export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1 in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile For more info see: https://www.howtogeek.com/444596/how-to-change-the-default-shell-to-bash-in-macos-catalina/ and: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050,True
@nigelblanchard5571,2020-01-03T12:21:47Z,0,"I have used the 3 files suggested by Corey in this video subject to amending the bash_profile with the additional line and noted that the PATH works and I have not used my original paths so put that to one side to come back to as the path shortened in the Mat/Corey adapted bash_profile seems to work. Running a test file with Visual Code works ok in Output and Terminal output BUT using Sublime produces the following output when running the code with ""python"" obviously selected:  ( i have not bothered to put full code in as it is only a simple function to check to see if number is a prime)  (B[m(347, 'is a prime number') [Finished in 0.2s]  The odd thing is the ""(B[m( "" bit of the start of the output in sublime??? Also I have seen that I will need to alter the PATH as  I got another odd thing  Corey you gave a great taster but I see that I may have to revert on this to my originals",True
@nigelblanchard5571,2020-01-03T12:12:56Z,0,"Great series and have slowly got to grips  trying to fathom some changes. I added the following to the amended .bash_profile used by Corey in the vid as I have installed Catalina and using Terminal produces an annoying nag about changing to ZSH.
