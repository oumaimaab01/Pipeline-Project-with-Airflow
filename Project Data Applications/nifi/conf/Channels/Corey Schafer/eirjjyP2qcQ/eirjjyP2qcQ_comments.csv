Around 8:40, we have t.hour which is an attribute but about 2 minutes later, we have dt.time() which is a method (which presumably we can call with other arguments). Is there any way in general of knowing whether these things are expected to be written as methods (with parentheses) or attributes (without parentheses).  It seems to be arbitrary and that one has to ""learn off"" the syntax instead of having any real understanding of what's going on underneath. Naively I would have thought that .time and .hour would be similar enough constructs doing similar enough jobs but it seems not as one is an attribute (I think?) and the other is a method.",True
