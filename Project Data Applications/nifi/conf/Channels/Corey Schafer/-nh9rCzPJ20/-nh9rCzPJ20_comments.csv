@RangerSkip,2024-05-19T21:41:41Z,0,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  🖥️ Setting up Visual Studio Code for Python development involves installing the software from the official website. 🛠️ Visual Studio Code is a lightweight editor, free to download, and can be extended with plugins for various needs. 📦 Extensions enhance functionality, with the Python extension being the most popular for Python development. 🔍 VS Code features a simple design with an activity bar for navigation, offering features like Explorer, search, Git integration, and debugging. 🎨 Customization options include changing color themes and file icons to personalize the editor interface. ⚙️ Users can access and modify settings through the command palette, either in UI or JSON format, to tailor the editor to their preferences. 🔄 Changing Python interpreters within VS Code is possible, allowing users to switch between different Python versions for their projects. 📄 Users can view and edit both their user settings and default settings simultaneously, facilitating customization and understanding of available options. 🐍 Setting up Python development environment in Visual Studio Code involves adjusting settings, like the default Python path, to ensure the desired Python version is used. 🔧 VS Code's integrated terminal can help determine the full path to the desired Python version, facilitating setting the default interpreter. 🖥️ Personalizing editor settings, such as font size and type, enhances readability and usability for individual preferences. 📦 Creating virtual environments for projects is beneficial, allowing isolation and management of project-specific dependencies. 🛠️ VS Code can detect and utilize virtual environments automatically, simplifying the process of setting interpreters for projects. 📝 Code formatting and linting are essential for maintaining clean, error-free code, and VS Code supports automatic formatting and linting configurations. 🚀 Extensions like ""Code Runner"" streamline the process of running code, with options to specify interpreter paths for virtual environments. 📚 Utilizing VS Code's features like IntelliSense enhances productivity by providing context-aware suggestions and navigation within code files. 🛠️ Configuring Visual Studio Code settings can enhance the coding experience, such as customizing code runner behavior and output. 🐍 Utilizing the integrated terminal in VS Code simplifies tasks like running Python scripts with user input, unlike some other editors like Sublime Text. 📁 Tracking projects with Git within VS Code is intuitive, allowing for easy initialization of repositories and staging changes. 🚀 Integrating with GitHub directly from VS Code streamlines the process of pushing code to repositories, making version control seamless. 🐞 VS Code's debugging features offer powerful tools like breakpoints, variable inspection, and interactive debugging consoles to troubleshoot code efficiently. ✅ Unit testing support within VS Code is robust, providing developers with built-in tools to manage and execute tests directly from the editor. 💻 Opening projects from the terminal using the ""code"" command facilitates workflow efficiency, enabling quick access to projects without navigating through directories. 🛠️ Troubleshooting environment-related issues, such as missing dependencies like Pylint, can be resolved by ensuring proper installation and configuration for the default Python environment. 🧪 Setting up unit tests in Visual Studio Code involves configuring the testing framework, directory, and test patterns. 🏃‍♀️ Tests can be run individually or as a class, with VS Code providing options for running and debugging tests. 🐛 Test failures are highlighted, indicating which assertion failed and on which line, facilitating debugging. 🛠️ VS Code allows for easy adjustment of settings to personalize the development environment, including font size and Zen mode. 🚀 Zen mode provides a distraction-free environment for coding, enhancing focus on code and output. ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts in VS Code are readily accessible via the command palette, enabling efficient navigation and actions. 💡 VS Code offers extensive features for Python development, making it a preferred choice for many developers. 📚 VS Code's documentation includes a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for easy reference and learning.

So pylint is now included with the Python extension and pylint is not even available any more.  Also, I would avoid using the Conda Python environment with VS Code because Conda also changes quite a bit and is an extra headache to coordinate with VS Code, e.g., Conda activation scripts have changed.  Also, on Windows the VS Code Terminal powershell and cmd  shells use DIFFERENT path variables.  Anaconda Python uses powershell path variables and most other installs use cmd paths (System and User environment variables).

Right now I have to restart my entire py code whenever there is an error in execution or debugging.
