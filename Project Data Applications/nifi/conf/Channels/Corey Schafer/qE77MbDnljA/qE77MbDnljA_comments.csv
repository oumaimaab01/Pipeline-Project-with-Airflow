Most of apps/softwares now I've found the Linux version/solution, only leaving the backup solution unsolved.

For example I can go back to the history of a file/folder hours/days/weeks earlier. I wonder if rsync do this?

@NoEgg4u,2020-12-25T06:45:33Z,0,"I am seeking a backup solution that supports ""full"" followed by incrementals.  And although rsync does this, it lacks the following functionality, which I think is critical to a viable backup solution:  -- If, for example, you schedule a daily incremental backup, and you are routinely editing various files, then your rsync backup will have your latest edits.  This is where it is potentially a problem, because you will have only your latest version of your files.  If you did not realize that you screwed up a file, then rsync will have made a copy of your bad file.  Now you have no way to recover your file, from the other day, prior to you screwing it up.  The same is true if you use the --delete option. If you absentmindedly deleted a file, and a week later you discover your mistake, well... rsync made an image (which is missing the file that was deleted), so now your backup drive will also no longer have that file.  Not using the --delete option is not a solution, because if I do intentionally delete files, then one day if I need to do a restore, I do not want files that I intentionally deleted to be loaded back to my computer.  I currently use Acronis' True Image for my Windows PC.  But I have filed papers and will soon be divorcing myself from Windows, in favor of a Linux OS. But I am new to Linux, and want to be able to undo my screw-ups, via a comprehensive backup solution.  True Image does a full backup, followed by incremental backups.  But their design differs from rsync, in that each backup stands on its own merit.  Each incremental backup is an exact image of the time that the backup was run.  In other words, if you run a daily backup, then you can restore your computer from any of the endless daily backups, and your computer will return to exactly as it was on the date of that backup. So you never have to worry about not catching a mistake right away.  If you deleted a file, you can go back, day-by-day (assuming you did a backup each day), until you find your file in one of the incremental backups.  Same thing for deleted files.  Go back far enough in your incremental images, and you will find the file that you had deleted.  And these are not full backups (except for the first one).  The daily incrementals are tiny.  They are based off of the first full backup.  Yet, True Image organizes the images in a way that you can pick any backup ever done and your files will be in that archive exactly as your computer was on the day of that backup.  To my knowledge, rsync does not include the above functionality. Is there a Linux based program that does the above?  By the way, True Image is Linux based.  When you boot from their rescue media, you can escape from their GUI and run a bash session. But the Linux based True Image is available only when you boot from their rescue media (used when you cannot boot Windows).  Their normal app seems to be available only for Windows.  I do not want to be forced to boot from rescue media every day, in order to perform backups as I described above.  So I am seeking a Linux based backup solution that will run while my Linux box is running in its normal boot mode.   Thanks for any help.",True

@BryTee,2019-09-09T06:50:18Z,5,"I have a lot of experience using rsync, and found some things to do around rsync that get around issues, especially to do with ""big"" files. How big is big is debatable, it depends on disk size, bandwidth, etc. Anyway... Firstly if a big file is moved from one location to another, as rsync (with the --delete option) does not search for every file to delete before copying files somewhere earlier in the tree, it is possible if the file is big enough that the big file is transferred and fills the source disk before it gets chance to go to the part of the tree to delete where the file used to be. Solution... Do a one time pass of purely deleting files before running the normal rsync, ie: rsync -av --delete --ignore-existing --existing SOURCE DESTINATION  Secondly, if the connection is of great distance and data transfer rate is slow, it is possible the rsync TCP connection is dropped before it completes copying a big file. rsync will then delete the half copied file, and the next run suffers from the same issue, and the file never gets copied. Solution... Use --append-verify so that if a timeout occurs, the next run of rsync continues from where it left off.  However --append-verify will not copy files of the same (or smaller) size, this can happen with a logfile that might change content and be the same size every run. Or with repodata XML files. Solution... Once the --append-verify run of rsync successfully completes, THEN run a normal rsync (without --append-verify) to ensure files that have different content or are smaller, get copied properly. However this runs into the problem of the file that needs to get copied is BIG and doesn't make it across and it's too easy to get into a situation where --append-verify is ok, but the final rsync is not ok, repeatedly, and a big file never gets copied. Solution... monitor this normal rsync (ie the one after the --append-verify) and if it fails delete the last file being copied on the destination system, and let the next run of this (say) cronjob start again and --append-verify will copy over the big file (in several steps).  FYI: I recommend the use of --conntimeout and --timeout to make rsync timeout if the connection hangs or has trouble starting. You might want to put a ""timeout"" command to call rsync anyway, in case rsync gets into a hung state internally.  Finally, this does not solve the issue of a timeout happening if the time it takes for the directory tree to be completely read is too long. rsync will half die, and it's difficult to see why. In that case, split the transfer into multiple sub directories trees, so the directory listing is not too big for rsync to end up timing out during startup.",True

@alanmead9830,2018-09-21T13:24:56Z,18,"Very clear and I liked the illustration for --dry-run. I'm also in awe of your typing skills (almost 18 minutes and not one typo!).  But I'd be careful of calling rsync a backup tool. While rsync makes a copy, proper backups should be versioned so that if you accidentally damaged a file a couple days ago, you can get a clean copy from the backup made three days ago. If you rsync nightly to a destination copy, the damaged version of the file would already be synced by the time you realized it was damaged.    You can add versioning to rsync (and --link-dest=dir can make it very space-efficient on the backup host) but you need to add a process for maintaining versions. Basically, to get seven days of versioning, you should rsync to a rotating day-of-the-week destination folder. But just rsync'ing to a single destination folder (as shown here) would not be versioned and would not be a good substitute for proper (versioned) backups.  But a great explanation of using rsync.",True
