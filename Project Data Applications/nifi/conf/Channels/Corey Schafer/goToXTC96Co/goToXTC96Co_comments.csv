@coreyms,2018-12-20T20:14:33Z,100,"In this video, we set up a Linux server from scratch before we deploy Flask, which is what a lot of people have requested. But if you already have a server ready to go then you might not be interested in the setup part. If you'd like to skip the Linux server setup and go straight to the deployment then please skip to 26:48  I hope people find this useful. Deployment can be a tricky topic because there are so many different choices (e.g. hosts, operating systems, web servers, etc). These are my preferred choices in this video.

@HumbertHumbert84,2020-07-23T16:08:49Z,0,"PROBLEM: My site is SLOW and everything happens as if DELAYED and ASYNCHRONOUSLY  Hi Corey, awesome tutorial! I'm a beginner Python programmer and I just deployed my app on a Linode nanode server doing exactly what you taught here (and after following your whole series), but my app doesn't work properly (as it did instead when I was testing it on my computer). I suspect that it's a problem with Gunicorn. Here's what's happening:  The purpose of my app is to do the metrical scansion of one or more poetic lines that the user uploads as a txt file. The site simply features a web form where the user can upload a txt file containing some lines of poetry, then he clicks on a submit button and the flask app produces a new file with the content of the original file and an interlinear metrical scansion (which is really just another line of text), then a new page is loaded (let's call it the ""scansion"" page) showing an alert that says ""scansion successful"" and a form with 2 buttons. With one button the user can download a txt file containing the scansion; with the second button he can display the content of such txt file in a new tab without downloading. Both options are handled with the Flask send_file() function (actually with a try/except block which in case of a FileNotFound error returns a nice error template).   This all worked perfectly fine on my computer. But now that the site is online, it's like everything is delayed and done asynchronously. For instance, I submit a file, I get to the scansion page but no alert is displayed, and if I click on either one of the buttons I get the error page. However, if I click and click again on the same button, after getting various error pages, I am finally able to download the file. So the app does work, but it's as if it just takes a long time for the file to get sent to the user!  Even if it's just a small txt file of a few KB. It seems that the server returns the ""scansion"" page, but it's not yet ready to handle sending back the file so if the user clicks on ""download"" or ""display"" he'll get to the error page. What is causing this? And finally, the alert will eventually appear too (maybe even on the wrong page, e.g. the initial page, where the template features a section for alerts in case of other upload errors). Moreover, if I try to upload another file after failing, I happen to get more than one alert on the same page at once! As if the delayed alerts from the previous upload attempts were indeed delayed and accumulating and then showing up all at once on a single page! The same happens with Chrome, Chromium or Firefox. My nanode is located in London and I am located in Italy.  The code that operates the metrical scansion is really simple (just some replace() working with strings), otherwise it just saves the uploaded file on disk, reopens it to work on the text, and saves the new text with scansion in a new txt file, that is then sent back to the user with send_file(). So I figured that this was a light and fast application.   How can it be so slow? Why is the site so out of synch and delayed? Is the nanode not enough for such a simple app? Does it have to do with the gunicorn configuration?",True

This proves that nginx server is serving static content and that it cannot serve the dynamic content because Gunicorn is not running yet. 58:02 - `nproc --all` - to find out how many cores on this machine 58:35 - `gunicorn -w 3 run:app` - now that gunicorn is running, we access our main site and this proves that nginx is passing HTTP requests to gunicorn 1:00:23 - `sudo apt install supervisor` - this software (written in python!) will run Gunicorn in the background 1:00:50 - `sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/flaskblog.conf` - create a supervisor config file referring to flaskblog package, and Gunicorn. Add corey's snippets 1:04:10 - note that we point supervisor to (yet uncreated) log files located: `/var/log/flaskblog/flaskblog.err.log` & `/var/log/flaskblog/flaskblog.out.log` 1:05:03 - `sudo mkdir -p /var/log/flaskblog`  1:05:22 - `sudo touch /var/log/flaskblog/flaskblog.err.log` & `sudo touch /var/log/flaskblog/flaskblog.out.log` - where we now create our log files 1:05:42 - `sudo supervisorctl reload` - where we restart supervisor 1:07:40 - `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - where we access general config file for nginx 1:07:54 - `client_max_body_size 5M;` - add this code in the config file to increase upload limit from 2MB to 5MB 1:08:30 - `sudo systemctl restart nginx`  Your site is now in production! :D",True

@lightninginmyhands4878,2019-03-30T20:41:38Z,21,"I think it's important to make the following distinctions after we switch from using Flask's local dev server to web-facing NGINX/Gunicorn structure:  Our Flask app is a *WSGI app* . It generates dynamic content (ex: user posts, user names). The way it can do this is by accessing the database (i.e. using SQLAlchemy). Gunicorn is a *WSGI server* which launches the WSGI app. In this video, Gunicorn is also a manager of 3 workers which each launches one instance of the WSGI app. NGINX  is a *web server* which generates static content (ex: navigation bar, page name). This also delivers HTTP requests to Gunicorn.",True

I followed all the way through (took me three days!) and configured on a local 8 core  box I had kicking around  The number of workers is set to 17  The app comes up correctly and everything seems to work  Until I start updating some in memory objects.  Then sometimes they show as updated and sometimes not  If I set the number of workers to 1, everything works as I expect I'm guessing that the 17 workers are each running their own version of the app and if I committed the in memory changes to db then retrieved them from memory it would work ok.  But that would take quite a bit of re-engineering. Is there a way to get the updates applying across all workers? Or am I understanding it incorrectly?    Thanks again :)",True
