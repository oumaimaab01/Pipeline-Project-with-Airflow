But then I  found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went  to the store to get some. There, I saw the most  beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole  life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a  three-year personality development course so  I can introduce my self. She was very friendly  and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend.  So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want  the best for her and I harbor no illusion that  I am the best person for her and she seems  happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother  her anymore. But we kept in touch and we  became friends and I got over my crush on her.  Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank  some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be  fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the  most beautiful woman in the world, but like I  said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five  years already when I first saw her. Besides, I  am quite happy with the friendship I developed  with her. It was more important than a crush.  So we kept hanging out, drinking, having  coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started  dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live  some other life without me in it, so I said,  okay, I want the best for you and I want you  to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and  I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the  same advice I gave her when she was in that  position and I became okay with the breakup  immediately. But we were really drunk, so she  spent the night in my apartment. I only have  one bed, so you know what that means: She  took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on  the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was  bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about  three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore,  I stood up and went straight to my room where  she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently  sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull  her closer to me. She stirred and woke up.  She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the  first time I saw you, I was watching a video  and left it playing to get my self a sandwich  then went to the store to get some mayo then  I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish  the video. She said, you know what, I've been  wondering about a weird noise in your night  drawer. So we opened that drawer and lo and  behold, there's my phone and this video still  had four minutes of play time on it.   jk vid was great! help me get 5,000 subs! Who read all of it?",True
@ConsuelaPlaysRS,2020-04-04T21:48:57Z,0,"FOR CASE INSENSITIVE URLS: at 8:30 in the video, use re_path(r'blog/(?i)', include('blog.urls')) instead (make sure to import re_path from django.urls, too).

@ProfRvS,2018-10-21T16:21:21Z,1,"Corey, thanks for your excellent videos.   There is one suggestion I have for future videos, however: I would prefer when looking at your terminal window for it to have a prompt containing the path to your current working directory. That would make it easier when coming back to certain parts of the tutorial, since one would know immediately know where things are happening. Currently, this is difficult, since you frequently clear the window (which makes sense in principle in order not to be distracted). I would imagine that this is easy to do on a Mac (I personally use Xubuntu, where that behavior is the default).",True

@MiLOooosSz,2018-09-27T10:11:16Z,0,"Hello! Sorry for bothering you, but I have a question and I can't find any answer. (I'm a beginner and trust me, I sucks... ;d) So, I created first app and I opened file views.py and then the first code line: from django.shortcuts import render is kind of wrong (?) Under the word ""shortcuts"" I got information: ""Unused import statement. This inspection detects names that shold resolve but don't. Due to dynamic dispatch and duck typing, this is possible in a limited but useful number of cases. Top-level and class-level items are supported better than instance items"" Then I wrote second code file (the same like you said in tutorial: from django.http import HttpResponse) and I got the same information. Propably it's easy but trust me, I'm green with Python and Django, trying to learn by myself :) I have Python 3.7, Django 2.1 and I'm using PyCharm.

@dklvch,2018-09-02T07:58:03Z,0,Hi! I have a weird problem with routing. I've already done a little project from mozilla tutorial. And it somehow saved routing configuration from that project.  When I open 127.0.0.1:8000 in this blog app it changes the url to http://127.0.0.1:8000/catalog/. I checked the urls file and there is nothing. Localhost:8000 works fine though.
