@bofh85,2020-06-24T14:56:18Z,0,"I created a Tool ""VM Snapshot Manager"" for exactly that purpose, which you can get from here: https://github.com/BOfH85/VM_Snapshot_Manager/tree/en-us  Why using this project instead of the build in Snapshot-Manager of Virtualbox? Well, first of all, this program was developed as a quick and dirty solution for VM Workstation Player which doesn't even have the option to create Snapshots. But furthermore I discovered that even with Virtualbox it is better if you store your snapshots as 7Zip-compressed 1:1 copies of your full vdi or vmdk File. Virtualbox splits the data in a complex manner if you create snapshots there which makes it quick to create one but takes also a long time to restore. And you always need the whole tree of snapshots if you want to clone or move your VM - you can't just take your .vdi File, ignore all the Snapshot-Files and mount it in a new machine as Hard Drive - the data won't be the same as your last working point in the old machine. But if you don't do snapshots with the programm at all und use this tool instead, you always keep your min vdi or vmdk File 100% comnplete and movable.  It's a terminal based python program which uses 7zip to high-compress your current VMDK-File (or VDI-File since you also can use it with Virtual Box). It basically copies and compresses your vmdk-harddrive and can restore the compressed files so that you can jump back and forward to any backuped state you created in the past. It's necessarry for the program to work that you store your VM in only one vmdk-File and don't split it up in several files. Maybe this tool is helpfull - if so just spread the news, it's free :-) Regards BOfH85",True

@midwestiowashooter,2018-12-06T16:09:02Z,0,Great video. What if you have several snapshots and you feel you are at a point to take a master snapshot. Can we delete older snapshots without effecting the final version?,True
