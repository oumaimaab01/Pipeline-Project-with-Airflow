@ajflink,2024-02-09T15:32:36Z,0,"I taught myself Python, which seem more beneficial and focused upon for jobs after college even though I did not major in computer science or have any courses for Python.  I am very confident in my Python programming skills. I never touched decorators due to how my mind works as it ends confusing me and also learned due to the stuff I program and what I use Python for I have surprisingly not encountered a scenario where decorators would have been more beneficial.  It doesn't help that the short definition and repeated explanation of decorators is a function that modifies a pre-existing function brings up some many questions. Then, the example is just a decorator  that adds another print statement or does something so simple that is impractical making me question the point of decorators. I often forget that they exist.  I feel like decorators are one of those things in Python where if you haven't need something like it before, you probably don't need it now.",True

@kartikeyamula9142,2023-11-29T18:19:01Z,0,"I have a doubt regarding the applying of the two decorators, @my_logger and @my_timer to the display_info function. First, display_info() goes into my_timer() function and there, the display-info() gets executed and so it prints: 'display info ran with arguments  (Hank, 30)', and then the time is recorded so it prints: ' display info ran in: 1 sec'. Then it returns the wrapper function, so now the display_info() function is now replaced with the wrapper function of the my_timer() function and is passed into the my_logger() function. The my_logger() function now creates a log file called wrapper.log and logs: 'Ran with args: (Hank, 30), and kwargs:' in the log file. But after that, orig_func(*args,**kwargs) is called again, with the wrapper function now being in the place of orig_func(), so why doesn't the wrapper function get executed again.

Terrific explanation as always - you're a master when it comes to explaining complex topics and making it simple to understand for anyone watching your tutorial.    I did have a question though regarding the end of video when you went over ""from functools import wraps"" to essentially solve the issue of why the wrapper.log file was getting created vs. what we wanted which was the display_info.log file.  My question is how does adding in the decorator wraps(orig_func) actually solve the issue - I understand by decorating the wrapper that it magically solved it but was curious if you could provide a little more detail on why that is?

@josefh8782,2020-04-27T04:51:47Z,0,"One more quick walkthrough here: What we did is that we set our decorated_display variable equal to our decorator_function, and we passed in our display function, and when we passed in our display function, its equal to our original function within our decorator, and then we create a wrapper function and we return that wrapper function, waiting to be executed. And when it is executed, it executes the original function, which in this case is display, and returns that. So when we run the variable, it is actually executing the wrapper function, which then executes our display function and prints out ""display function ran"" and then your head explodes.",True

@EV4UTube,2019-10-02T00:28:51Z,0,"I would say that you did a much better job than most in presenting the topic of decorators.  That said, I can't help but feel that there is still a missing 'magic bullet' with the typical instruction regarding decorators which I have not yet found.  For me, personally, a HUGE amount of confusion stems from something really silly and simple - the choice of naming conventions (for variables, functions, classes, etc.) and  the choice of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) used to deliver that instruction.  I feel that (other) instructors perform a serious disservice to students when they describe decorators by saying something like... """"Decorators functionally extend the functional functionality of a function to a function (or within a function) to deliver additional functionality without functionally modifying the original function.""  And then they go on to choose names for variables, functions, wrappers, classes (etc) to include some variation or derivation of the word, 'function.' I've seen this kind of thing done a lot and it seems a bit sloppy or lazy when there are other perfectly acceptable terms could be used in the interest of clarity. In English, the word 'function'/'functions'/'functioning' can be noun, verbs (and derivations can be adjectives or adverbs). Despite watching this video, I still don't really have a strong handle on decorators, but I can imagine something like the following being more clear (for me at least): ""Decorators let you to preserve the core calculation of an important function while allowing you to also generalize or modify the inputs to that core calculation, or allows you to piggy-back other outputs - like deriving related information, tracking transactions and logs and a host of other capabilities.""  See how the word 'function' was used just once, it was a noun and it specifically referred to the target/core/original function. In fact, I think the use of generic graphic or animations representing the FLOW of a decorator would be helpful (i.e., not even showing any coding) in order to grasp the conceptual and logical process of a decorator.  The other issue  with decorators - from the perspective of a newbie - is that decorators seem like a solution in search of a problem.  It would be good if we provided a clear and relatable baseline scenario from which we could then set-up a situation / problem where the student could understand why we would need to even deal with decorators at all.  Say, something like: ""The SuperMega Company has a standardized formula/calculation/function for measuring sales in a given month. This core formula is perfect for the Sales Department, but other departments need to glean other kinds of information from the sales data. Decorators allow us to meet the specific needs of various departments without modifying the standardized / core formulation for measuring sales.""  Now that the students understand how/why decorators serve a important role, we are motivated to grasp the concept and to consider other contexts where they might be valuable.",True

It seems that the @decorator_function permanently hijacks the original function, if it has arguments. Is there a way to set this up to allow either the original function or the decorator to be called?   For example, if the line containing @decorator_function is commented out, then this allows two different variables to call the display function. display() # this prints out the unwrapped output as expected new_usecase = decorator_function(display) # returns wrapper function new_usecase() # prints out the wrapped output as expected   # However, this doesn't work when assigning a function with arguments to the variables even when including the (*args, **kwargs) snippet. new_usecase = decorator_function(display_info('Tom', 22)) # Returns None (Why does this return None, when decorator_function(display) returns the wrapper???) new_usecase() # TypeError. Object NoneType is not callable.   Why is this? Does it have something to do with the way Python handles functions with arguments, or is it simply because passing the arguments invokes execution? In that case, once hijacked, always hijacked, right?",True

I was using Kivy to manipulte widgets and this and OOP tutorials helped a TON! Subscribed! If you have the time to explain Kivy, it would mean the world. Thanks a lot!",True
@MAC0071234,2017-05-09T17:35:44Z,0,"when using the double decorators, your display_info function is being called twice and it runs twice - 1> in my_logger and 2> in my_timer. But it logs just once since only once its being called through the logger. This i think is a issue. How can we solve this. And also if we want to use multiple wrappers after calling the method once and also want it to run just once (even though if we are using multiple decorators), how can we achieve that? Apart from this i got pretty much everything you taught. Great tutorial.",True
@narasimhanmb4703,2017-05-09T03:59:32Z,0,"Hi Corey Really appreciate what you are doing and it immensely helps. I have a question here. It makes sense to pass (*args,*kwargs) to the original_function inside the wrapper. But why should we pass the same arguments to the wrapper function itself? Could you please explain this?",True

@midinerd,2017-04-15T14:52:14Z,0,ahhh the wrapper() def at 22:17 (for example) is using closure to keep the orig_func resolution without it being in the args list. ahhh thank you (realized this in your follow-up video higher order functions)  thanks!,True

@pkaramol,2016-09-30T15:45:14Z,1,"At about 12:15, Is the return statement for the original_function within the wrapper function necessary?

@manikanth2166,2016-08-05T22:02:57Z,0,"This is great, but if the folks want to use decorators in truly perfect way, its better to implement using the wrapt library by Graham Dumpleton.

@rmalshe,2016-06-20T04:12:59Z,834,"The way you teach programming is really nice!  Its very basic, it is paced very well, and it is very logical. In addition you use code snippets that are really concise. Many other videos are either too fast, or too slow, or often simply lack the logic.   Often times one can see videos, or written programs but when the teacher doesn't tell why it should be done in a certain way, the inspiration is missing, and then it is very tempting to pick up bad habits that may look simpler, but are inefficient methods.  Keep up your good work, and every now and then when I will look for efficiency, I will search for your name :)  Now I wish you were a data scientist at Intel where I work.",True

I recently switched from Pycharm to ST3, but one thing is really annoying for me: I use SublimeREPL in a way, that I have a split editor, on the left with my code ran and on the right the python console. Is there a way to make the python console interactive?  For example, to be able to check the len() of a variable that I declared in my python code instantly from the console, after I built the code? This would be highly effective for simple debugging, like in Matlab, or Spyder. Also, which Linter do you recommend to use?",True
