@bufordkoechig3127,2020-05-13T13:11:54Z,0,Hi Corey. Great tutorial. How does one set up key based auth that allows a user from 2 different machine to use their own ssh key for login? I have 2 different machine that need to access same remote machine. One works fine but the second machine/user still needs a password even though ssh-copy-id has been run and both keys are in the authorized keys file. I can reliably re-create this issue. There must be some other requirement to allow more than one user to key based auth on the same remote. Thanks.,True

@vsrajan,2020-05-01T20:21:44Z,1,"Hi Corey, great video. 1 question though. If you disable password-based logins and then want to authorize a new user to be able to login, how do you set up key-based authentication for the new user? ssh-copy-id will not work as pwds are disabled on the remote host. How would you configure the public key for the new user? I hacked this by logging in as root, manually creating the .ssh folder, copying over the public key from another user and setting the appropriate permissions, and changing the owner for the .ssh folder and the key file from root back to the user. This works. But very hacky. Are you aware of an easier way of doing this?",True

I know I can google these, but I really enjoyed this video for its simplicity and a new one with more details would certainly clarify things for more people, who don't even ask themselves these questions but benefit from knowing the answers.  1. Is it safe to share your public key with anyone, even by placing it on a website? 2. Is it worth having several key pairs if you want to authenticate to different servers? 3. Is it possible to have more key pairs on the same PC? 4. What's the best encryption algorithm and key size nowadays? -> here's a nice article, but it's from 2016: https://blog.g3rt.nl/upgrade-your-ssh-keys.html 5. How often should we generate new pairs, to be safe? 6. How about a few tips for managing the keys? Are there SSH key managers like password managers? Do we store them on encrypted USB drives or on a personal (Next/Own)cloud? etc.",True

How is one server's private key on your machine, separate from another server's private key? Do all of them show up with the same name but different hash content inside the file? I also wonder how could one know which key belongs to which server (if you have to do it again in the future).
