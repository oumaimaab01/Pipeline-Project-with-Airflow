Such as line spacing, character spacing...etc.   Also, if I want to search for a text or a specific ""word"" in all .pdf and word files that are located on different directories and different drives (external/network), I usually use mdfind ""word"" to search all files and folders on all drives that contains the word that I'm looking for, however, sometimes mdfind does not find what I'm looking for, even though it should. For example, if I'm trying to find all files pertaining to a client with last name Kennedy, I use mdfind kennedy, that would usually find results such as: /Volumes/MainSSD/Users/mike/Documents/E.
