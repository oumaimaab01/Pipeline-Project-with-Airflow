@harshitgupta7073,2022-06-28T12:02:42Z,0,Why I can't create a local variable inside a class just like in function   Means inside class declaring variable makes a class attribute which can be call outside the class via classname.variablename    1.What's the difference BTW a function variable and attribute 2. can I assign a local variable In class ?

And not as he said that when It's type 1. situation, the self is unable to override. Why is that?   Same issue with Employee.num_of_emps += 1 by typing  emp_1.num_of_emps = 3 print(emp_1.num_of_emps) #turned to printing 3 My instance variable could override my class variable...

@ch012,2020-09-16T17:17:35Z,0,"So the crust is that as a general practice you create the variables in a python object in a dynamic manner....the object takes the empty class structure and then starts adding variables thru the __init__ method. Therefore, your variables are inside the object . This is little different from the languages like Java and C++ where you define the variables are properties inside the definition of the class itself. Hence you have choices in Python, either you define the class variables (as a part of the structure of the class itself) or object variable (as self.variablename inside the __iniit__ method)..",True

@sharothiiesmat3557,2020-06-21T15:54:45Z,2,Hey Corey... You mentioned that setting your class variable i.e Employee_raise_amount to 1.06 will also change the raise_amount of instances. But I ain't getting the same results. I deliberately changed the emp_1.raise_amount to 1.02 and that of emp_2.raise_amount to 1.08 but when I used the class variable Employee.raise_amount equal to 1.06 the raise amounts of emp_1 & emp_2 is not changing. Can you please give me an idea about it. Thank you,True

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-08T08:10:05Z,779,"Summary: In this video, Corey taught as how to differentiate between a Class variable and instance variable, how they are related to each, other, and when each of them is more useful over the other.   Class variables are variables that we set inside a class, and are shared among all instances. Corey gave a good example where the number of total employs should be the same to every employ, no matter which employee we are referring to. Therefore,   emp_1.num_of_employ = emp_2.num_of_employ = Employee.num_of_employ   Instance variables are variables that are different from each instance. For example, the names and the pay for each employee. They have to be different.   Corey also shows that class variables and instance variables are closely related, and that class variables are kind of 'inherited' to the 'self' variables. To illustrate this, Corey shows an example of 'annual raise of pay'. He initially creates the class variable to show a case where annual raise is equal among all the employees. This variable of 1.04 was accessible through each instance, and also through the class itself(obiviously). That is, print(Employee.annual_raise) print(emp_1.annual_raise) print(emp_2.anual_rais) all printed out 1.04.   However, using the .__dict___  thing, Corey shows that the intances, emp_1 and emp_2 does not contain the annual_raise value. Corey explains that if a variable is not found within an instance and programmers try to access the variable, python automatically looks in in the variable of the instance's class, and then the more classes that the instance's class inherits from.   Furthermore, if we access the class variable through an instance and then change it, python creates the variable within the instance. We can check it by using the .__dict__ thing. Corey shows that annual_raise key was created when he manually changed the annual_raise value as 1.05 in the following way. emp_1.annual_raise = 1.05 however, we know that the class variable remained the same at 1.04, when printing the class variable. print(Employee.annual_raise)   ==> 1.04",True

Why wont the line ""num_of_emps = 0"" at the beginning of the class reset the counter at each instance? Should i look up Private and Public variables?  I tested the code out and it turns out that the lines before the __init__ wont be run each time i create an instance.  However if there is only the class in the code and i don't make  any class objects, the variables before __init__ are being declared.  I know that it works but  i need some hints on WHY and HOW it works :-|   Thanks in advance guys (or gals)!",True

@nicop175,2019-12-28T18:31:33Z,0,"Corey, I am a huge fan of yours. Please keep on going with the tutorials.   I am a bit confused about the difference between self.raise_amount or Employee.raise_amount.   Let's say we have a class like this.   class Employee(object)          raise_amount = 0.04          def __init__(self, name, surname, pay):         self.name = name         self.pay = pay       def apply_raise(self):         self.pay = int(self.pay * (1 + self.raise_amount)) # situation 1         self.pay = int(self.pay * (1 + Employee.raise_amount)) # situation 2   empl1 = Employee(""empl1"", 50000) empl2 = Employee(""empl2"", 60000)                                                                 empl1.raise_amount = x                      Employee.raise_amount = x situation 1: self.raise_amount               empl1 get's affected                             empl1 get's affected                                                                     empl2 doesn't get affected                  empl2 get's affected   situation 2: Employee.raise_amout      empl1 get's affected                             empl1 get's affected                                                                     empl2 doesn't get affected                  empl2 get's affected      As far as I can see, the first column the situation 1 and 2 produces the same result, and in the column 2, situation 1 and 2 produces the same result.   So when you say we have different results, you mean between column 1 and 2, right?   I mean, the BIG difference lays that if you do empl1.raise_amount, empl1 get's created the attribute and empl2 doesn't get affected (but this is independent if you have defined self.raise_amount or Employee.raise_amount), because basically you have overwritten the class attribute.   In this case, if you do:   empl1.raise_amount = x Employee.raise_amount = y   Changes in the class don't affect empl1.    How can I revert this behaviuor? Should I have a method that restores the default to class.raise_amount?   def restore(self):     self.raise_amount = cls.raise_amount   Hope this makes sense.

@subhasnandy391,2018-05-22T18:46:06Z,0,"Thanks a lot. Your tutorials are quite descriptive. I have certain queries.   1. Since I come from a background of C++, I am tempted to ask this question. In C++, data members of a class could not be initiated within the class itself. We need separate constructor or member functions to assign values to class variables. However, in Python, we can assign default values to class variables within the class itself (as done in raise_amount=1.04). Does that violate the concept of OOPS by any chance ?  2. In C++, we have the concept of Access Specifiers like defining private, public and global. How is it implemented in Python ?  Would be great if you help me sort them out.",True

So  i think at the end  what matters is  that if this class variable is explicitly with the specific instance is changed (i.e emp1.raise_amount = 1.05 ) it will keep on reflecting the change  for specific instance (here emp1 instance ) and rest all instance will reflect the value from class variable as this class variable won't be  in namespace of other instances Am i on the  right path ? and again thanks for these great stuffs !",True

@dagl8,2016-12-09T18:51:51Z,0,"Dear Corey, I was wondering. After changing a specific variable such as emp_1.raise_amount. How could we: 1. Change this specific one back to following the Employee function again (not just changing it to the same value, incase Employee.raise_amount would change)? Code: emp_1.raise_amount = Employee.raise_amount Employee.raise_amount = 1.1 ##emp_1.raise_amount = Employee.raise_amount  Without the commented lines, emp_1 changes to the previous employee.raise_amount but doesn't automatically follow to the new one.  2. Set all edited variables to follow the Employee.raise_amount again?  3. Do we make a function which changes raise amount in emp_x till emp_y, where x and y are variables we can set?  (I don't understand how to get x and y defined because typing something like emp_[x] won't let it work inside a function as emp_[] isn't a defined thing.)   I hope my questions are somewhat clear, I find it hard to explain exactly what I want, which  shows how much I still have to learn.  Love the videos, keep them up!",True
@alivarinlioglu3707,2016-12-04T19:33:07Z,0,"Corey hey, absolutely amazing videos, thank you very much for doing this. I have a question regarding the video. Let's say we set emp1.raise_amount to 1.05 as you did in the video and then we decided that emp1 doesn't deserve 1.05 raise and should have the same raise as other employes.  Is there something like taking this back, so that it gets the value from Employee() as other employes ?",True
