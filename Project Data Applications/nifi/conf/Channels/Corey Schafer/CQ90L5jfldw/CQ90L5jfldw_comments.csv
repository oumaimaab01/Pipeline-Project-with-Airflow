@jacobyoung5759,2020-06-19T16:55:56Z,1,"For those who want to fix the profile page when the invalid/existing username or email appears in the header after a failed profile update:  What's happening is that when u_form is checked in is_valid() and fails because of an existing username, the code exits the if block and renders the post request. The problem with that is that the post request.user contains the value for username that failed which is then passed on to the profile template.   So to fix this, I retrieved the user of the current session with user = User.objects.get(pk=request.session[""_auth_user_id""]) at the top of the function and passed it in as a key, value pair in context, so that context['user'] = user. The template sees the user from context rather than from request then. Also make sure to import from django.contrib.auth.models import User at the top.   I'm not sure if this is best practice or not as I am also learning Django with these tutorials, but if anybody has any questions or feedback, feel free to reply.",True

My question is, how can we delete the old profile picture file, the one that we are going to update.  Instead of creating a new file with a suffix added to the filename which is, I noticed, signifies what the latest profile picture is, for the same filename update. What we need is to just delete the old profile picture all throughout.  Since for this purpose, it is not that critical for whatever purpose of data rollback or whatever that may be.   Please do a video on this too.  This is a big help because the effect of this is critical. If not deleted, old, no longer used files, linger on the server which is costly.   The way you teach shows your maturity and your experience in the field.  I don't mind you teaching the detailed approach, just like what you did in the django deployment in Linux server.

Quick question/clarification: the reason we were able to access the image from the homepage via {{ post.author.profile.image.url }} is because the  author column of the post table is a foreign key to the user username table as set in the blog app models + the profile has a one to one relationship with the the user table as set in the user app models - right?   It seems kind of intuitive, but I'm looking through the docs to see what would work with this and what wouldn't and I get the sense that in the other frameworks I've experienced (mostly PHP ones like Laravel, Symphony, Yii + Flask) one would have to be much more explicit about these connections - but maybe it's just intuitive b/c you're so smooth and make it seem so obvious.

Secondly, I've run into a really weird bug or behavior I do not understand when resizing the images. At first my images wasn't being resized properly so I sprinkled some logging in the save function of the Profile class. Just before the if-statement I logged both img.width as well as self.image.width and the two differed, with the former set to the limit of 300, while the latter had the original size. I then continued to add more logging and added an else statement to make it something like this:    needs_resize = img.width > 300 or img.height > 300   logger.error(f'{img.width}x{img.height} {needs_resize}')   logger.error(f'{self.image.width}x{self.image.height}')   if needs_resize:    logger.error(""In resize before work"")    output_size = (300, 300)    img.thumbnail(output_size)    img.save(self.image.path)    logger.error(""In resize after work"")   else:    logger.error(""No resize needed"")  The weird thing is that as the above is written, I will get this output: 190x300 False 515x812 No resize needed  If I on the other hand comment out the line img.save(self.image.path) I will get this output: 515x812 True 515x812 In resize before work In resize after work  Any clue on what's going on?

I commented this line out, and the form appears to work just fine with two slight differences: (1) the field name now appears as ""Email address"" instead of ""Email"", and (2) the field is no longer required (i.e., marked with an asterisk).

@boryskuczkowski,2018-09-05T10:20:00Z,0,"Ok, I think this is a serious issue which needs to be addressed - emails. I think each email should be unique, during registration we should run a check against database (something like unique=True on email), you can have multiple usernames with the same email, also you can update the email in your profile for an existing email of other user. I wanted to change that using unique argument but it seems you can only do that on models and we provide an email field from forms. Can you give a hint how to fix this? Thanks",True
