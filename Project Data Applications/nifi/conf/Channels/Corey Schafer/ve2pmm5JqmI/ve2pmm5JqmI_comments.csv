@brucea9871,2022-11-15T00:12:27Z,0,Very useful program for this type of problem. I sometimes purchase courses on various subjects that come with 24 to 96 lectures and I don't care much for the standardized names they use for the lectures since they provide no information about the topic of the lecture. But in my case automating the file name change would be more difficult since the topic of each lecture would be difficult for a program to determine (the program would have to access the website for the company I purchased the course from and somehow locate the topic of each lecture). I did notice one slight error in your video; not in your work but in the numbering of the original files. They are supposed to be in order of the planets from the sun but Neptune came before Uranus (Neptune's lecture was #8 while Uranus' was #9). In reality Uranus is closer to the sun than Neptune so Uranus should have been #8 and Neptune #9. (And strictly speaking Pluto is no longer considered a planet but a dwarf planet.),True

(I was thinking, 'z-fill is set to 2, so shouldn't it take both digits from 10 and turn it to 00?') But I finally realised that z-fill only fills the characters that DON'T EXIST and turns them to 0. So since 10 is the only f_num with 2 digits, it remains the same, while all the others get a 0 added. Neat solution!",True

It does something even better and I desire so badly to be able to duplicate this one day.   Here is a description of the feature that Listray does: Say as an example I want to download something from the web into a folder. If I have that folder open and the application Listray running, once the save to dialog box opens, if I click on the open window of the folder I want it to go into then click on the save to window dialog box, it changes the address to without me typing in a thing. Like you did with the Mac.  So Listray must be doing something almost identical to what you did manually with the Mac.  I desire to duplicate the feature the Mac does on the PC but without dragging the file if possible.

@albertbatfinder5240,2019-04-29T23:26:00Z,0,"You made a fundamental mistake. You tested it all the way with print statements, then made a significant change to the format and ran the CRITICAL rename statement without a final check. All the previous checks were great, but unfortunately they lulled you into a false sense of security.  Also, never run a mass file change in place without a backup. It would have been instructive for your viewers to see even a maestro copy the whole folder somewhere else first. Make a mass file change or database change and it WILL bite you one day. I guarantee it will.",True
