(My lab actually caught a freakin Seagull on north coast) the seagull was fishing, and my dog swam to it, around 30 feet away she dove underwater, then swam under the seagull and grabbed her !!!!!! Yea it died on the spot because labs actually have a huge power in their jaw. but it was funny as hell !!!",True
