The script extender needs to be in the same folder as the game files, including the launcher obviously, but the game needs to be launched through the script extender instead, otherwise the mods wouldn't work. Even if Skyrim is written in C++, does it still mean that the mechanism is similar to the one in this video, meaning that the code in the script extender is not going to run if it is being imported, but rather it's the whole game that needs to be imported in the script extender ?",True

@purplepapaya1853,2023-01-17T16:20:01Z,0,"Hi thanks for sharing! This might be a stupid question, but how were you able to print __name__ instead of using print(__name__) and didn't get an error? I thought you need parenthesis when printing.",True

@EV4UTube,2023-01-13T04:24:59Z,65,"I have found a way of conceptualizing this line of code  in a way that (for me) may be easier to understand ...    Think of any single individual who is part of a family; we will call this person Xavier.   Let's talk about the relative terms we use when relating Xavier to the rest of his family.                                  His parents consider Xavier to be his SON.                          His sister considers Xavier to be her BROTHER. His second-tier relatives consider Xavier to be their COUSIN.           His grandparents consider him to be their GRANDSON.                           Lastly, Xavier considers Xavier to be HIMSELF.  Xavier is still the same person in each of these relative relationships, but the relative term we use for him is different depending on who we are relating to.  So, when we write,  ""If __name__ == __main__""  then we are effectively asking is: ""If <relative pronoun> == HIMSELF"" If that code evaluates to TRUE, then we know that the program is running on its own - it is referring to itself.       <relative pronoun> == ""HIMSELF"" If, however, that code evaluates to FALSE, then we know that the program is running as a component of another program. That is, when you run the code ""if __name__ == __main__"" and it evaluates as FALSE, then it would be **metaphorically** equivalent to the return values being something like the following:       <relative pronoun> == ""SON""       <relative pronoun> == ""BROTHER""       <relative pronoun> == ""COUSIN""       <relative pronoun> == ""GRANDSON"" In other words, Xavier is not operating as HIMSELF, he is operating in relation to some other entity (a subcomponent of another program).",True

@anuragtambe,2021-06-27T14:22:19Z,0,Question: Why we write code in python main() method ?  Answer: As when you call the code from other module it provides additional flexibility. You can call the code without the main method getting executed. Or you can specifically call the main method of imported module.   Key things   1) Specify the code inside of main() method. 2) Specify if condition for variable dunder name to be equal to dunder main 3) Call main method in this if condition.,True

@HansBezemer,2021-05-20T16:56:54Z,0,"Well, it's fancy - but what problem does this actually solve? Either you write you module as a module - that is a set of API calls. In the rarest of occasions you want to run something automatically - since you don't know of side effects in conjunction with other modules - or even your main program. It's far more secure to let the application programmer do any deliberate initialization calls - since he knows his program best and is better equipped to make these kind of decisions.  So IMHO its just a BAD programmer discipline to allow a module to do both (be a module and a ""main program"") - since obviously you cannot make up your mind what your program actually is. A good practice is when you start copy/pasting code from another program, you may want to refactor it, put those bits into a module and use it as such. It makes for much cleaner application code - even because it's just.. shorter!  However, the mere LACK of discarding stuff from a module by using a PRIVATE keyword indicates to me that Python was really not made with proper modularization in mind. If you import a slew of libraries you're simply polluting the namespace with garbage names. It's awful.",True

He rose again on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment for our sins, in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. If you humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true, he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",True

@johnfrazer7964,2020-12-07T19:35:58Z,0,"IMHO that `if __name__ == '__main__':` stanza is one of the most unfortunate things there are in Python. It is an antipattern because it exploits some implementation details around Python's module system to do something that is not directly related to the properties involved, that is to say: when I write this code I do so not because I'm in any way interested what the value of that magic `__name__` variable is, I do it because I want to know whether (the code in) this file is being run on the top level or being imported. A slightly better way would be if it was possible to write `if module.name == 'main':`, but even that is still worse than, say, `if module.is_toplevel_script():` (go think of a better name if you will).   Now that bazillions of programmers have been spoon-fed this line and made to believe that `if __name__ == '__main__':` is a good, Pythonic way of expressing ""in case this file is being run at the top-level, ..."" it has found its way into basically every single Python project there is, meaning we're forever stuck with it (or at least with the particular way the `__name__` variable is acting in this case).  Unfortunately the present topic is only loosely related to the workings of Python's `import` statement otherwise I would be tempted to complain what an overengineered but poorly designed mess that is.  Note this is not a criticism on the video in any way. I didn't even watch it because the haunting memory of having to type `if space underscore underscore name underscore underscore space equals equals space quote underscore underscore main underscore underscore quote colon return` several times a day is too grating for me.",True

My 14 year old son is learning to program in Python, but of course in my day Visual Basic was all the thing, so I have a hard time helping him even though I am very good with VB.  The syntax is quite a bit different and the way people use Python is also quite a bit different.  Even just the fact that logical statements like if, while, for etc. don't need to be terminated but rely on formatting is new to me.  No more ""end if"".  Visual Basic is more like Visual Pascal only without dynamic variables.  Shows how old I am.  And when did we go back to running stuff from the command prompt?  It took me an hour to figure out how to get my computer to launch python that way even with the help of a video.  Mind you I wasn't very familiar with setting system variables.  I also really miss the ""Step"" debugger function in VB.  I found something similar in Python but since half the time you are in imported code I have no idea what it is pointing at.

@Asdayasman,2020-03-23T09:19:19Z,0,"Long term Python developer here.   I hate this stupid convention.  All it does is serve to indent ALL of your code, which is something I think stuck because fogies are scared to see stuff at the top level.   If your module is getting imported by someone, then it shouldn't run anything (other than setup) at the top level.  If your module is intended to be a command, it should never be imported.  The idiot who didn't read the docs and imported your command module should be punished for being so stupid.   If you're putting stuff in the command module that's SO useful that someone wants to import it, _you're_ stupid for not putting it in a separate module.   (Also double quotes ftw.  Single quotes are called ""apostrophes"" and are used in strings quite often).",True

Here's how I use it:   When I write a module meant to be imported, I build a main that includes calls to the imported code using test data.

A minor difference, sure, but this could hinder a beginner's understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved.   Regardless, thanks for your videos.

@adityanambiar6056,2019-07-13T14:17:33Z,0,"Wonderful explanation!  So it looks like this is like setting private members for a module in a project where you have multiple modules. In OOP, as you have private variables to a class similarly in a Project, you have private data (variables/functions) which you want to hide from other modules that import this module. Therefore, this construct allows you to do it the way Python handles Private variables in it's OOP constructs. Sorry to the reader if these statements sound repetitive though. :P",True

I know many here are well versed in Python will know this, but for those new to Python here is an example of why you would employ the 'if __name__ == ""__main__"" in a module.  When you build a module, you will want to test it and make sure it works to spec.  The beauty of it is that you never have to remove it and it gives you an easy way to test out your module before importing it into other Python files.",True

I use tkinter and have linked a button to a function from where I intend to call B.py, but I don't know what to include in the body of that function. Can you help?

In the file first_module.py,  you have the line of code: print ""First Module's Name: {}"".format(__name__) .  I saved and ran this file, I got syntax error at the double quote ("").  But interestingly enough, when I put the whole line of code, except the ""print"", into parentheses:  print (""First Module's Name: {}"".format(__name__))  I got no error and got the same output line as you ran it on your Mac machine:  First Module's Name: __main__  I am using Python 3.6.3 shell in Windows.  Maybe Python ran differently on different OSs or because I use the newer version of Python.  I am an engineering tech for RD department of a sensor chip maker firm.   I mostly use Matlab scripts to run validation tests at work. I have no idea about Python but I think I can start learning the basics as Python becomes super popular. I used to be a contractor technician for an Intel lab in Santa Clara, CA where  they required technicians and engineers using python.  I just knew some linux scripts back then.  Thanks, Corey.
