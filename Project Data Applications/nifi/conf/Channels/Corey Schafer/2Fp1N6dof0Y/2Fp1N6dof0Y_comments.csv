@AdamSuchan,2019-07-24T17:48:50Z,0,"Hello Corey. I need to pool some sensors at a faster rate then cronjobs can provide (One every 15 secs, and 3 more every 10s, with actuator update once a minute). Would you recommend the subprocess solution to manage the timings or is there something else more worth looking into? A real benefit would be allowing the CPU to go into low power mode between the runs. All happening on Raspbian (Debian offshoot for RaspberryPi) and Python3.",True

As I mentioned in a previous post, I just finished renovating a house that I'm selling and am currently going through a cross-country move, so I haven't been able to post as much lately as I'd like. Once I get this house sold and get settled into my new place then I'll be releasing at a much faster pace.
