@sn713,2021-09-17T02:34:26Z,0,"Jewels of All Religions ... (Excerpt from message of Shri Datta Swami)  Spirituality requires divine virtues, which are emphasized in various religions. The firm faith of Islam, the infinite love of Christianity, the tolerance towards other religions of Hinduism, the social service of Buddhism and the non violence of Jainism are important virtues that a spiritual person must acquire. These are practical traditional aspects of various religions, which are more precious than their scriptures. These traditions bring out the most important essence of the respective scriptures.  Tolerance of Hinduism ...  Hinduism should be another page in the Book of Spirituality. The house of every Hindu contains pictures of different forms of God. At the same time Hindus see only one God (Parabrahma) in all those forms of God. They treat the different forms of God as different dresses worn by the same Divine Actor. This indicates that there is only one God for the entire world and Lord Krishna, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, and Mahavir are only different dresses of the same God. This understanding brings about, not just tolerance of other religions, but also the brotherhood of all human beings in the world.  Firm faith of Islam ...  One must praise the firm faith of a Muslim in God, accompanied with strict regularity and discipline. Other people worship God either in their leisure time or on a holiday. But a Muslim worships God everyday, whether it is a holiday or not. He worships God at regular intervals of time whether it is leisure time or work time. The faith in God and the importance given to God precedes everything and every activity in his life. This aspect is a page in the book of spirituality.  Infinite love of Christianity ...  Another page in the Book of Spirituality is the tradition of Christianity, which is infinite love. Lord Jesus says in the Bible ‚ÄúRevenge is mine‚Äù. Christians love even their enemies and prove that their love is infinite. Love is God. God is infinite and so Love is infinite. Such infinite love alone can attract God. The proof of love is in sacrifice through service. Christians sacrifice a lot of their money for spiritual work. Their love is so unlimited that they sacrifice money even to the spiritual centers of other religions. Even if some religion is opposing their religion, they fund the other religion. This shows their love even for their enemies.  Their love for their family bonds is very weak. So the love in their hearts is stored without much wastage. This concentrated love in their hearts flows entirely towards God and so they sacrifice a lot of their earnings for the work of God. Also they do not store their wealth for their children, and they ask their children to earn and live on their own after a certain age. Thus they are able to sacrifice their earnings for God without worrying about saving for future generations.  Similarly non-violence of Buddhism, Jainism etc.  Without spiritual knowledge, you can never achieve world peace i.e., world without terrorism, corruption and similar vices.

@datboi_gee,2020-02-07T16:59:49Z,2,"This is phenomenal.  I've been working -- or rather TRYING to work -- on a project that requires complex string parsing and I've been hating my life.  It's mostly my fault because I'm doing extra unnecessary work.  I'm working on a competitive programming problem in which I'm expected to be given a tuple of strings, and within them I'm supposed to extrapolate specific data, convert and adjust values mathematically based on the composition of each string.  The issue comes in with a personal dislike for writing what I feel is dirty code.  By this I mean I've been given very clear constraints, and explicitly told that these strings will always be formatted in a particular way.  And yet I feel dirty just hard-coding values based on the explicit format the string is guaranteed to arrive in.  I wanted to build something far more comprehensive and flexible.  Something that would identify the values and assign them not based on their position in the string, but rather based on their composition.  While I do recognize I'm making this harder on myself than I have to, and that these extra details aren't at all necessary for the sake of completion, I'm thrilled to have come across regex.  Because even if it's unnecessary in this current use case, something like this feels like an incredibly potent tool to have under your belt.  I love it.  Thank you for the video.

@TheKimhansu,2018-04-21T22:22:46Z,1,"I'm certainly less anxious about proofing and using regex now. This video is great! I've been slowly going through it and repeating everything in a Jupyter Notebook. The section that resonates with me is the search for emails. I saw the utility in the process of slowly and systematically finding each email then adding to the code to successively find the rest.  But you were right, there was a way to just use a character set to find all the email addresses, just thought I'd share it with you and anyone else who might be interested: 'pattern = re.compile(r'[a-zA-Z0-9.@-]+'). I do realize that if the data set was more diverse your code would return less, if any, undesirable matches while, mine being more general, has the potential to bring more undesirable matches.    This was fun. Thanks!",True

I created a regee that pulls a bunch of links from a txt document. However, I can't figure out how to separate the output into separate lines. I know it has something to do with the fact that some of the href's are immediately followed by another (<a href=""..."">xxx</a><a href=""..."">xxx</a>. I setup the test just like your example with a for loop using 'finditer'. I've tried using split and  it didn't work. I also tried using the '$' at the end of the regex and that didn't work either.  I'm very new to this and can't figure it out. Can you take a look at this and suggest a solution? Thanks in advance.  pattern = re.compile(r'<a href\=\""\w+\:\//\w+\.?\w+\.\w+\.?\w+?\""\>.*\</a>')  matches = pattern.finditer(doc)  for match in matches:     print(match.group())",True

@FreePalestine8096,2017-12-09T23:50:46Z,0,"Hey Corey, you mentioned that adding 'r' before the re pattern indicates to Python that backslashes should not be interpreted with any special meaning. But then you mentioned that metacharacters need to be escaped with a backslash and in the example you provided (r'\.') the re pattern was preceded by an 'r'.   I guess it's implied, but just to be crystal clear- are metacharacters the exception to this rule regarding 'r'?",True
