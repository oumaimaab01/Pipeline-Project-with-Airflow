Everything went fine with signals functionality, but when I've tried to access 127.0.0.1/admin and enter the admin credentials, an error message has been popped up telling me that the admin user didn't have a profile. The source code that triggered the error was just the one in the save_profile function (RelatedObjectDoesNotExist error to be precise):. This showed that the save_profile function was called right after the data on the admin login form had been submitted. The solution I came up with was simply commenting out the save_profile function, login in the admin page, create manually a profile for admin user and then bringing the save_profile function back to life by removing the comments marks on it.

This even happens if the database is completely empty. Its a bit of a pain, but i would think it was there to protect database integrity.

@as00060,2020-05-01T14:34:04Z,0,"Hey Corey, I have been working on a small project, and it was developing smoothly until I got a road block which I think this video is the solution for. However, due to the workflow of my website, I am not able to implement exactly the way you are trying to route to the profile page. My workflow is as below 1) user sign up and see a login screen 2) user login and now he see a form, where he/she needs to fill in mandatory fields 3) save and then either click on ""profile"" page to see the profile data, or ""save"" button will redirect to the profile page automatically.  4) user logout and the next time he/she logs in should see the profile page directly, and not the form to fill in the extra data.    However, after going through your video on ""profile"" page, I have put the profile in the navbar. So, now even if the user log in to see the form page, he/she still has the profile link to redirect to the profile page through navbar, which is fine. But in the video I didn't see that how you are fetching the data from the data base to show in the ""profile"" page. May be I didn't understand properly. Sorry if this is a dumb question. I am completely new to web development in general. If you can help me out with the changes in the GET method, I can share my project details to you in google drive, or anyway you want.    I have been working on this for some time now, and this is a big road block for me. Please let me know.",True

Make sure its in the media directory not the profile_pics directory 2. You can use the inspect element interface on your website(Right click the blank image and hit ""inspect element"" this will highlight the picture and tell you where its looking for the link to the image) 3. If when doing this it does not display anything, then it means the account does not have a profile, go into admin and make one. I spent an hour and a half searching code to finally figure this dumb error on my part out. 4. Make sure whatever image you use is a jpeg if you are following the code perfectly 5.
