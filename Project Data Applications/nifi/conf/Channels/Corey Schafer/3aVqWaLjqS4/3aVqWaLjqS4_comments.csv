@ccandour,2024-04-08T19:34:55Z,4,"If you're using Django 5 or higher you will encounter the problem with accessing the 'logout' page directly from the browser like Corey does. This is because the logout endpoint can be accessed now only using a 'POST' method, and accessing it via a URL is using the 'GET' method. One of the ways you can resolve this issue is to add this short code snippet instead of the standard link element in the navbar:  <form action=""{% url 'logout' %}"" method=""post"">     {% csrf_token %}     <button type=""submit"" class=""btn btn-outline-light"">Logout</button> </form>  Doesn't look perfect but it works :) Hope this helps!",True

Any help would be appreciated :) It's about the last part of your video: reverse routing. For example: I have an article in the blog. And user wants to leave a comment. Only authenticated users can post comments. OK, then user decided to log in. And after succesfull logging in he/she wants to navigate to previous page. So, there should be such shema: post page > logging in > back to the same post page. How should I implement this?) How can I remember adress user is came from?",True
