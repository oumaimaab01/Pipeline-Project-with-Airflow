@VodKaVK,2020-03-13T14:19:25Z,0,"Hi Corey - you mentioned that you weren't sure about the difference between .at and .loc.  Well, me neither, but going back to the data survey from Stack Overflow, I tried changing every single cell in the column 'LanguageWorkedWith' into a list of the languages, instead of a string.   .loc didn't work, not sure why. I only managed to achieve it through this.   for i in range(1, 88863):      df.at[i, 'LanguageWorkedWith'] = str(df.loc[i, 'LanguageWorkedWith'])     df.at[i, 'LanguageWorkedWith']  = df.loc[i, 'LanguageWorkedWith'].split("";"")   Not sure why I couldn't do it with .loc",True

Around the 36:51 mark, you map the 'Hobbyist' column like so: {'Yes': True,  'No': False}. I followed along and updated the 'Hobbyist' column TWICE by mistake, so now the entire 'Hobbyist' column is filled with NaN, NaN, NaN, etc... for every single respondent answer.    How do I revert this column back to normal; back to its original state in the .csv? Many thanks in advance.",True
