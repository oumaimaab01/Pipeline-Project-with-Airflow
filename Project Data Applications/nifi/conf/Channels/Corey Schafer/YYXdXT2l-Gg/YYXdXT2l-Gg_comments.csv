It is 64-bit only as Apple is deprecating 32-bit support in future macOS releases. For 3.6.5, the 10.9+ variant is offered as an additional more modern alternative to the traditional 10.6+ variant in earlier 3.6.x releases.    ‚óè The 10.6+ variant still requires installing a third-party version of Tcl/Tk 8.5.    ‚óè If you are using macOS 10.9 or later, consider using the new installer variant, unless you are building Python applications that also need to work on older macOS systems.    ‚óè Binary extension modules (including wheels) built for earlier versions of 3.6.x with the 10.6 variant should continue to work with either 3.6.5 variant without recompilation.

@freaker005,2017-08-31T15:03:19Z,0,"Hi Schafer, really u are doing great work u r explaining the language down to earth is really awesome.go ahead.  I try to set the python3.6 version as default in ubuntu 16.04 version but its not happening. so i googled it and i found this details and it resolved the problem.so anyone facing issue like me use this. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Setting python 2.6 as default on Linux  If you have a later version than 2.6 you'll need to set 2.6 as the default Python. Later versions would be 2.7 and 3.1; see what you have by typing  python -V at the terminal. For purposes of this example we'll assume you have 3.1 installed. You'll next need to execute the following commands: sudo apt-get install python2.6 idle-python2.6 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.1 1 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.6 10 sudo update-alternatives --config python This last command will allow you to choose which version of python to use by default. If you have done everything above correctly, python2.6 should already be set as the default. If it is not, choose it to be the default. From now on, running python should start version 2.6.  Undoing These Changes  In some cases (e.g., installing or updating certain packages), you'll get an error message if you've run the commands above. To update these packages, you'll have to temporarily undo these changes. Here's how to do that:  sudo update-alternatives --remove-all python sudo ln -s python3.1 /usr/bin/python Once you're done updating these packages, execute the commands at the top to set python2.6 as the default again. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Thanks.",True
