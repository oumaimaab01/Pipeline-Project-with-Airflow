I have the .bash_profile calling the .bashrc and it also calls the .bash_prompt from your next video on the Github options.

I am doing this all on a Mac Mini connected as a MAMP installed server set up on a local network and I can work that server via Screen Sharing from a Macbook Pro.  I have:   export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.0.8/bin:$PATH   a an extra line in the .bashrc because I am using it to shift to a more current version of php than my native Mac version because I have it installed with Drupal 8.  I have tried remarking it out, I have changed the order, I have added another export PATH around the initial bash calls and moved the more current php version call to the end to see if processing order and potential command differences between php version might be why I am getting the Command Not Found error.  Like I said, all the functionality seems to work in the sense that the prompt changes are in place and php -v confirms the version update has run;  but I still have a ""Command Not Found"" showing up before I see the modified prompt.
