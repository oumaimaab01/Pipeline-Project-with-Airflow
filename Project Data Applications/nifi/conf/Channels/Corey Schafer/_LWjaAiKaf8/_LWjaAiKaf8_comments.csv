The next video will cover how to plot live data in real-time. We will learn how to monitor a CSV file for changes and add that data to our plot as it's being generated, so be sure to check that out.

@anujsharma3656,2024-05-18T15:45:09Z,0,It took me quite a while to get it to work. 1) I had to install ffmpeg otherwise I was getting index error which was impossible to resolve . If it was not for chat gpt I could not figured out. 2) Also I had to add a frames by using reading len(data['x_value']) to animate object to make FuncAnimation being called and also updateanimate func with frames being updated during the call to be used again 3) I running jupyter notebook from vscode. I had to add %matplotlib inline. Though my plot still does not show dynamically with plt. show . I had to save the animation to file to view it getting updated dynamically.,True
