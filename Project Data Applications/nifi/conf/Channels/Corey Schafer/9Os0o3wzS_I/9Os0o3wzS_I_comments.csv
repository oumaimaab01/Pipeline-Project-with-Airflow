@carolchang619,2020-10-07T23:06:48Z,0,"Passing Arguments to a Function Sometimes it is useful not only to call a function, but also to send one or more pieces of data into the function. Pieces of data that are sent into a function are known as arguments. The function can use its arguments in calculations or other operations. If you want a function to receive arguments when it is called, you must equip the function with one or more parameter variables. A parameter variable, often simply called a parameter, is a special variable that is assigned the value of an argument when a function is called. Here is an example of a function that has a parameter variable: def show_double(number):  result = number * 2  print(result) This function‚Äôs name is show_double. Its purpose is to accept a number as an argument and display the value of that number doubled. Look at the function header and notice the word number that appear inside the parentheses. This is the name of a parameter variable. This variable will be assigned the value of an argument when the function is called. Program 5-6 demonstrates the function in a complete program",True
@carolchang619,2020-10-07T23:01:52Z,0,"5.7 Introduction to Value-Returning Functions: Generating Random Numbers Concept: A value-returning function is a function that returns a value back to the part of the program that called it. Python, as well as most other programming languages, provides a library of prewritten functions that perform commonly needed tasks. These libraries typically contain a function that generates random numbers. In the first part of this chapter, you learned about void functions. A void function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a specific task. When you need the function to perform its task, you call the function. This causes the statements inside the function to execute. When the function is finished, control of the program returns to the statement appearing immediately after the function call. A value-returning function is a special type of function. It is like a void function in the following ways. It is a group of statements that perform a specific task. When you want to execute the function, you call it. When a value-returning function finishes, however, it returns a value back to the part of the program that called it. The value that is returned from a function can be used like any other value: it can be assigned to a variable, displayed on the screen, used in a mathematical expression (if it is a number), and so on.",True
@carolchang619,2020-10-07T22:56:51Z,2,"The randrange, random, and uniform Functions The standard library‚Äôs random module contains numerous functions for working with random numbers. In addition to the randint function, you might find the randrange, random, and uniform functions useful. (To use any of these functions, you need to write import random at the top of your program.) If you remember how to use the range function (which we discussed in Chapter 4), then you will immediately be comfortable with the randrange function. The randrange function takes the same arguments as the range function. The difference is that the randrange function does not return a list of values. Instead, it returns a randomly selected value from a sequence of values. For example, the following statement assigns a random number in the range of 0 through 9 to the number variable: number = random.randrange(10) The argument, in this case 10, specifies the ending limit of the sequence of values. The function will return a randomly selected number from the sequence of values 0 up to, but not including, the ending limit. The following statement specifies both a starting value and an ending limit for the sequence: number = random.randrange(5,10) When this statement executes, a random number in the range of 5 through 9 will be assigned to number. The following statement specifies a starting value, an ending limit, and a step value: number = random.randrange(0, 101, 10) In this statement the randrange function returns a randomly selected value from the following sequence of numbers: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100] Both the randint and the randrange functions return an integer number. The random function, however, returns a random floating-point number. You do not pass any arguments to the random function. When you call it, it returns a random floating point number in the range of 0.0 up to 1.0 (but not including 1.0). Here is an example: number = random.random() The uniform function also returns a random floating-point number, but allows you to specify the range of values to select from. Here is an example: number = random.uniform(1.0, 10.0) In this statement, the uniform function returns a random floating-point number in the range of 1.0 through 10.0 and assigns it to the number variable.",True

@carolchang619,2020-10-07T22:20:48Z,0,"Python allows you to write Boolean functions, which return either True or False. You can use a Boolean function to test a condition, then return either True or False to indicate whether the condition exists. Boolean functions are useful for simplifying complex conditions that are tested in decision and repetition structures. For example, suppose you are designing a program that will ask the user to enter a number, then determine whether that number is even or odd. The following code shows how you can make that determination: number = int(input('Enter a number: ')) if (number % 2) == 0:  print('The number is even.') else:  print('The number is odd.') Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the Boolean expression being tested by this if-else statement: (number % 2) == 0 This expression uses the % operator, which was introduced in Chapter 2. This is called the remainder operator. It divides two numbers and returns the remainder of the division. So this code is saying, ‚ÄúIf the remainder of number divided by 2 is equal to 0, then display a message indicating the number is even, or else display a message indicating the number is odd.‚Äù Because dividing an even number by 2 will always give a remainder of 0, this logic will work. The code would be easier to understand, however, if you could somehow rewrite it to say, ‚ÄúIf the number is even, then display a message indicating it is even, or else display a message indicating it is odd.‚Äù As it turns out, this can be done with a Boolean function. In this example, you could write a Boolean function named is_even that accepts a number as an argument and returns True if the number is even, or False otherwise. The following is the code for such a function: def is_even(number):  # Determine whether number is even. If it is,  # set status to true. Otherwise, set status  # to false.  if (number % 2) == 0:  status = True  else:  status = False  # Return the value of the status variable.  return status Then, you can rewrite the if-else statement so it calls the is_even function to determine whether number is even: 329 number = int(input('Enter a number: ')) if is_even(number):  print('The number is even.') else:  print('The number is odd.') Not only is this logic easier to understand, but now you have a function that you can call in the program anytime you need to test a number to determine whether it is even",True
@carolchang619,2020-10-07T22:20:03Z,0,"You can also use Boolean functions to simplify complex input validation code. For instance, suppose you are writing a program that prompts the user to enter a product model number and should only accept the values 100, 200, and 300. You could design the input algorithm as follows: # Get the model number. model = int(input('Enter the model number: ')) # Validate the model number. while model != 100 and model != 200 and model != 300:  print('The valid model numbers are 100, 200 and 300.')  model = int(input('Enter a valid model number: ')) The validation loop uses a long compound Boolean expression that will iterate as long as model does not equal 100 and model does not equal 200 and model does not equal 300. Although this logic will work, you can simplify the validation loop by writing a Boolean function to test the model variable then calling that function in the loop. For example, suppose you pass the model variable to a function you write named is_invalid. The function returns True if model is invalid, or False otherwise. You could rewrite the validation loop as follows: # Validate the model number. while is_invalid(model):  print('The valid model numbers are 100, 200 and 300.')  model = int(input('Enter a valid model number: ')) This makes the loop easier to read. It is evident now that the loop iterates as long as model is invalid. The following code shows how you might write the is_invalid function. It accepts a model number as an argument, and if the argument is not 100 and the argument is not 200 and the argument is not 300, the function returns True to indicate that it is invalid. Otherwise, the function returns False. def is_invalid(mod_num):  if mod_num != 100 and mod_num != 200 and mod_num != 300:  status = True  else:  status = False  return status Returning",True
