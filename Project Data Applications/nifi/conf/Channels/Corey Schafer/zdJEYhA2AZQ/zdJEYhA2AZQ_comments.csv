@santoshpss,2021-03-23T05:02:19Z,0,"Important Fact:  Standing Bodies Of Water are *always* level (level means no elevation or deviation from the starting point to the end). This is a scientific fact because this is observable, testable, repeatable, measurable, demonstrable by every single human being alive. This fact alone destroys the mathematical concept and religious idea known as the ""heliocentric model"". More specifically, this fact alone makes it impossible for us to live on an exterior of a pear-shaped sphere spinning at fantastical speeds going nowhere.  Just before you start to attach straw man fallacies on to me, keep in mind these important things:  There are three different sciences: Natural Science (which deals with the Objective World)  Social Science (deals with societies and the relationship between people in societies)  Formal Science (deals with languages such as mathematics which bares no connection to the Objective World)  ""What is the shape of the earth I stand upon?"" this is a Natural Science question.  Science does not belong to an institution or a group of people. It belongs to every single human being alive.  We live in the present. Not in the past or the future. History can never be considered as a fact of reality in any way shape or form because of obvious reasons. We can't directly experience the past or the future.  Just observing something is not a fact that something exists. We need observable, testable, repeatable, measurable, demonstrable practical proofs for something to be considered as a fact. This is also known as the Scientific Method.  There is a difference between the corporeal world (the physical world) and the visible world. The reason why we can't conclude something as a fact based on our observations is because we know things get smaller based on how far they're from us when we see them through our eyes. If I see a railroad, the lines look like they're converging, but we know that's impossible because people measured the lines, and the lines are parallel. The lines don't actually meet in real life, it's just how we see things. Our eyes are spherical, we see euclidean (planar) world through spherical eyes.  Without physically testing, repeating, measuring, and accessing something in full three dimensions, it's impossible to know exactly what it is that we're trying to quantify.  Looking up at the sky does not give you measurable proof of the earth you stand upon. It's like looking up at the light in your room and then measuring the floor based on that light. It's absurd.  Images and videos are never considered as scientific proofs because of obvious reasons. Images and videos can be manipulated, they're not tangible. We can't directly experience them.  Mathematical equations bare no relation to the Objective World. Mathematics is just a language, like English. Just because something is mathematically correct does not make it real. It's like saying ""I'm flying!"", even though the sentence is grammatically correct, I'm obviously not flying right now.  ""Gravity"" is a mathematical concept, it's pseudoscience. It does not have any practical proofs. Magical pulling forces don't exist in the Objective Reality. Motion only happens if something presses on something else (pressure variants). Pull is just a term for taking something closer to someone.  Things falling down has got nothing to do with the shape of the earth. In the simplest sense things that weigh more than air fall, and things that weigh less than air float. Why do things even fall? No one has any practical proof for why things even have weight. The mathematical theorists are making assumptions about why things are falling, but understand that those are just assumptions, not facts.  The sky, the Moon, the Sun, and the Stars are all intangibles. If every single human being can't observe, test, repeat, measure, demonstrate something in a practical fashion, it is considered a belief, or pseudoscience. Does every single human being has access to these lights in the sky? Obviously not. Not to mention stars look like flashing lights when looked through a Nikon COOLPIX P900 (It's still not a proof of anything because we can't move around them in full three dimensions).  Admitting to yourself that you truly don't know something is the most honest realization you could have, it is how you progress further. For example, I do not know what the Sun is. The mathematical theorists are making assumptions of what the Sun is, and where it is located. They don't know what the Sun actually is, or where it is located. Unless I could move around the Sun in full three dimensions, the only possible stance I can have is ""I don't know"". Anything beyond that will be a belief. For example, if I say ""The Sun is a cylinder-shaped object moving in the sky"", it is just a belief because I can't move around the Sun in full three dimensions to know if it's a cylinder or a circle. The only thing I know is that it's a light in the sky moving in a straight line across the sky (because of how our eyes work it looks like the Sun is moving in an arc across the sky, but the Sun is actually moving across the sky in a straight line).  Another example, ""I know the full dimensions of earth"" is also a belief because I never explored the whole world to know the full dimensions. Remember, something only becomes a fact if it's observable, testable, repeatable, measurable, demonstrable by every single human being alive. In this case, each and every individual should explore the Objective World to its fullest extent, listening to ""authorities"" is just a belief. The world ""map"" is also a concept, because every single human being didn't explored the whole world to verify or falsify the map. People are believing in whatever the ""governments"" say or show. People are literally believing in complete strangers and thinking the official ""world map"" is true and there is nothing more to explore because they see a blue sphere on their TV.  Just because the majority of the population are believing something exists doesn't mean something actually exists in the Objective World. Once again, we need OTRMDPPs for something to be considered a fact of the Objective Reality.  Letters before your name does not mean anything. Direct experience is the most important thing. If we can't experience something directly then most of the time it's useless for us.  I can only represent myself. Personalities are OUT of the question.  If I drop a brick on my head I know what's going to happen. The objective reality does not change based on your subjective opinions or beliefs. It is what it is.  Why is this important? Well, the government and its associations are BLATANTLY lying about our existence, the shape of the world, and the dimensions of the world. What's more important than finding out how far the world extends? Full exploration is needed for further understanding of life's most important questions: where we are, why we're here, and what's it all about. Without knowing where we are everything we do is just a concept.  For example, if I give you a board, and without giving you any instructions or rules, I want you to play a game, what game are you going to play? The government and its associations are telling you what you're suppose to do, what's expected of you, what you're not suppose to do. Who agreed to their ""law"" book? I certainly did not. How is it fair that the government and its associations (the police and the military) are imposing their subjective rules onto the human beings? Everyone has different rules about different things, subjective rules are personal, they're NOT objective. These governments, police, military are imposing their SUBJECTIVE rules onto others, this is nothing short of tyranny.  Why can't we freely explore the objective world as much as we like? Why is there a physical, and mental restriction by the police, the military, and by psychopaths known as the governments?  Remember, no one rules if no one obeys.  ""People are arguing and fighting over what game to play when they don't even know the board they're playing on"" -Del (Beyond the imaginary curve youtube channel: https://youtube.com/channel/UCvswlgeHodOejVN21TWweLw) (People are arguing about what to do without knowing the full dimensions of the world)  Another analogy: if I erase your memory and put you in a confinement, what is the first thing you're going to look for? Where's the exit. But if I put some actors to distract you by showing you books and telling you there is no exit, then you'll never try to even think about the exit, there will be other brainwashed people just like you who'll brainwash you even more. Then some other actors will tell you what to do, what's expected of you, what you're not suppose to do, and what's the punishment for breaking their god-given ""law"" book, some other brainwashed people will also have weapons so that common people like you will forcefully follow my law book, which makes my job incredibly easy by making you a slave if that's what I was ever up to.  Why should we accept slavery? Why should we accept strangers imposing their subjective versions of what's good and what's bad onto us?  If you have OTRMDPPs (Observable, Testable, Repeatable, Measurable, Demonstrable Practical Proofs) that large Standing Bodies Of Water can bend, (sounds absurd to even think about it) please feel free to email me at MysteriousPlane@pm.me, but understand that I should be able to demonstrate your claims in a practical fashion, because that's how the Objective World works. No offense, but If your claims does not have any practical proofs, then I'm afraid I have to conclude that you're either blatantly lying or you're really stupid (Or for some reason you want to defend your religious beliefs, because the Earth being a sphere is a religious belief, a mathematical concept, it has no practical proofs, it has no relation to the Objective World, that being real life).",True
