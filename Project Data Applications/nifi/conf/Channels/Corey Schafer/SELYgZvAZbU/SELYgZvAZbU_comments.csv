@coreyms,2019-04-09T17:15:47Z,24,Hey everyone. I'm going to be releasing a Python video today at noon showing how I wrote a script to analyze a JSON API of Homebrew Packages. You don't need to use Homebrew or be on a Mac to follow along. It will be great practice for anyone learning Python.  I will also be releasing a video next week showing how I use Homebrew to set up a new MacBook from scratch using scripts. Hope everyone is having a great week!,True
