@markkennedy9767,2023-02-11T02:05:46Z,0,"At around 5:00, it seems that dictionaries are mutable where student.update updates the values of the dictionary and then print(student) prints the modified-in-place student. Is this correct and is that a correct interpretation of mutability? What I don't understand is how even though some of the values in the dictionary are strings, these strings can seemingly be modified in place to new strings using student.update. Also, when you type print(student.get(""phone"")), this is remniscent of what we do when we use methods on IMMUTABLE objects like strings, where we get something returned. Yet here we are also obviously getting something returned (and printed) from a mutable object, the dictionary student.  Is it possible that you could clear up my confusion. Thanks",True

@MarkSudduth1,2022-10-08T03:27:26Z,0,"There is a slight inaccuracy in something you said around the 2 minute mark.  You said that a key is any immutable data type and technically this statement is not wrong, but it implies that keys can ONLY be an immutable data type, which is inaccurate.  There are mutable data types that can be keys.  It would have been more accurate to say keys MUST be a hashable data type.  All immutable objects are hashable but not all hashable objects are immutable, an example of a mutable object that is hashable is a user defined class object.  There is also the curious case of the tuple data type.  Tuples are an immutable and should therefore be hashable, but if a tuple contains a mutable data type such as a list, then it will no longer be hashable, therefore could not be used as a key.  And it gets even weirder because an unhashable  tuple still has a __hash__ attribute.  So its like some kind of transvestite data type that hasn't completely transitioned, lol.
