But just one suggestion here: I think this last video of this Matplotlib tutorial should probably be the 2nd video of this series. The reason is: directly using plt.xxx() method is actually a shortcut in this case. When plotting one figure, different codes have different style, while people can be confused on plt.plot and fg, ax = ..... It would be really helpful to guide the audience regarding this difference in the beginning compared to now in the final session. Just my two cents. Thanks!",True
