@expat2010,2020-11-18T06:42:19Z,17,"I started learning databases and VBA when I was around 50, almost 30 years ago. Worked both fulltime but mostly freelancing. I've been studying Python for a year or so, mostly because I love it but I've  also picked up several simple freelance jobs.   So while I refuse jobs now I would have taken decades ago because they are just too complex and exhausting, still, 79 years old, self taught, (well, help from people like Corey!) , I'm a productive programmer. My suggestion is that if you feel for one reason or another  you will not be successful in a highly competitive market, find a niche out of the mainstream that you enjoy, that you are passionate about. If you love it, - hate to break away from studying or working through problems even to eat or sleep, you will be good enough to be productive. Don't compare yourself to the best - you don't have to be best. And you don't have to be ""well rounded"" if you find a niche that does not have a lot of competition.",True

@damipad4,2020-02-26T13:19:24Z,1,Thank you for all the helpful advice. I always find myself wishing that I explored my interests in programming and technology sooner than what I did. The reality is that we can‚Äôt change the past so I try not to dwell. Dwelling will just take away my time from learning something new,True

@Sauhros,2019-11-12T07:57:59Z,5,"Im 22 years old and I started learning python because one of my university's business professors recommended I get exposed to it if I wanted to do market research as my major's emphasis. I have to say I'm grateful for it because like Corey said it has opened my eyes to a lifetime of learning and I am just absolutely thrilled because of it. Although,  I sometimes feel overwhelmed because I feel lost that I'm learning so much and still don't really know how to apply all the concepts together, the hunger and passion to find where things connect drive me. Thank you so much Corey you are a magnificent person your doing so much for everyone who watches your videos and I just wanna take the time to recognize your commitment. Keep on learning everyone its never too late!",True
@jirikadlec1058,2019-09-20T20:47:06Z,1,"Regarding editors and IDEs, I would really recommend Anaconda and Jupyter notebook or Spyder. It is really useful for inspecting the arrays you work with and displaying plots in your code.",True

@rverm1000,2019-08-31T22:28:15Z,1,"ive been in electronics for years, but not really that serious or committed to learning programming. python is an interesting language. spending the last 3 months learning little bits of information from books and videos. experimenting with the code. anyone can learn alot from experimenting with code writing little programs to see if it will accomplish a task.  its has also helped me at work to write simple programs to listen to the serial data and write serial commands to the electronics.  it has made my job easier and  helped me to get noticed. so far so good. at 50 any tool that makes my job easier is a good tool. Social skills are equally important  thanks Corey for making great videos",True

@nullptrZer0,2019-03-08T09:37:01Z,4,"Thanks for pointing this out on the last one. I am indeed in my late 20s, and due to health issues I was forced to do a career switch and decided for programming. And I got the exact same feeling to have to catch up with others, who do this for the last decade or so. So thank you for your wise words and the encouragement! Also no need to say that your channel is just rad. Your videos are so much better, than most of the courses I paid for. Thx for teaching us!",True

@andreiindries1121,2018-11-08T13:02:47Z,40,"Totally agree with the age or switching careers here. I was 34 years old when I started to learn to code in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, PHP and Laravel. After 1 and half year of learning, at age 35 I got a job as a junior full-stack developer and now I am learning Python and Flask. So is never too late to learn if you want something.

@bowenwang,2017-04-10T05:18:25Z,56,I am from China and I am a Java and JavaScript developer. In the last week I have begun learning Python by myself and I found your channel. The first video I saw was List comprehensions. Your explanations were so clear and easily understandable and I almost finished all your videos relating to Python. I have exactly the same experience as you do. I majored in computer science at college but did not find it interesting and I considered finding another job after graduation. But now I really enjoy coding and sometimes I regret wasting so much time at college. So I work hard everyday trying my best to catch up but most importantly I like what I am doing and thank myself for letting me entering the amazing programming world.,True

@SinCityGT3,2016-11-15T19:38:48Z,0,Great points! Only point I'd add is that it seems like knowing Python alone isn't enough. You really need to decide if you want to do web development or data science/machine learning. Most jobs fall in those areas.,True
