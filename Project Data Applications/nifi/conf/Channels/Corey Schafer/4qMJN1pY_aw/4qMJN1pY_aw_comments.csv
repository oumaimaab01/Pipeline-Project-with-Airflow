@satter87henne,2017-04-29T09:40:00Z,1,"Hi +Corey Schafer,  what do you think about PyQT5? I wonder if we could create apps for IOS or Andoid with PyQT. Anyway, learning how to create GUIs so that other people can use self written programs would be super great!",True

@iduran,2017-04-18T19:15:02Z,1,"Hi Corey, thanks for the amazing tutorials. Have really learned a lot from them. I would really like if you could post some milestone project assignments after certain topics so we could test ourselves what we have learned, and then a short walkthrough of the project solution. I think that would be great. Thanks again.",True

@SkillCollectors,2017-04-18T04:50:29Z,0,"I found that I learn the most from your videos when you run through how you use a particular module. Like your os, datetime, PIL videos for example. It's been 4 months since I started learning python and now I can find the docs I need to get something done but a couple months ago, that was still pretty difficult. Your vids really helped show a lot of useful functionality. I came to your channel from Derek Banas' ""learn to program"" series, after watching his OOP videos, I had a hard time grasping it. I must have watched your OOP playlist a dozen times over the course of a month and I finally think I'm using classes properly as of two weeks ago, haha.",True
@jereziah,2017-04-18T02:31:37Z,0,How about taking some of your exisiting vids and code snippets and giving them a GUI. Followed by creating executables and macOSX stand alone programs.,True

@MaxGoddur,2017-04-17T17:10:14Z,0,"Currently I support one video creationist this is due to the constraints of my income but would like to add another and the one I add will be my goto source for answering questions that seem to fall in between the cracks. You have probably seen these questions out there that have merit but just go unanswered. Let me give you and example.  Recently while testing a very simple line of code Python3.6.1 on Windows 8.1, all this code did was list each and every file on the C:/ drive. Unfortunately it seemed to fail with a Windows 8.1 Dialog box stating there was an application error, leaving the program state of close or do nothing.  Finally decided to test with a simple print statement and to my surprise after some looping it to failed in the same manner. Well since I was using the  Python 3.6.1 default editor and shell it was time to open Powershell for testing and to my surprise all the problems I was having disappeared. Oh, what I did was rather then running the scripts from within the Python 3.6.1 shell I decided to launch then from the PowerShell command line and no more crashes. What is going on?  Thank you and look forward to hearing your take on why this is happening. As of this day have not rolled back to Python 3.4 or 3.5 and test but that might be an interesting idea.",True
@songokussj4cz,2017-04-17T16:43:38Z,11,"Hi! What about Python OOP Tutorial 7: Real-world usage of Class (I do not mean like the car / school-student examples) Where you would show some normal script and then gradually transcribe it with the help of classes, then gradual extension of these classes (Methods, @properties, @classmethods) and finally interacting 2-3 classes (without inheritance) with each other - how to pass variables or data structures or the class as whole or write into Class one global var from Class two method. I'm trying to do something like that and I'm lost. It's somewhat functional but I don't know if I did it right.  Cheers on 32K Subs!",True

I started programming 2 years ago and I'm now doing some videos trying to teach ...  but I got to admit it's pretty hard to do when your in high school and your bombarded with exams...,True
