You seem to pull them out of the air. Be a good idea in your next videos to tell us where to read more. Also this crispy business doesn't work in mar 2023 django 4. Then I think some of your videos are too long to really absorb the info in a meaningful way.

It seems 'ordering' is an available attribute when using class based views - this seems like an important point to go over. Would mind responding and just explaining how those attributes work? I was confused because I thought it was just a user defined method - but it seems to be an available attribute we can set the value to depending on the behavior we need. Please, I would highly appreciate it if you could elaborate on this as it can get very confusing. For example, what other class based functionality has similar attributes? etc.  Thank you so much for your content, I donate on Patreon when I can.
