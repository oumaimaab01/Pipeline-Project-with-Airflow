I want to build a website with fancy UI that will expose, some video processing capabilities to end-users. Example: Upscale your videos to 4k using ML, Auto-caption your videos, among others.  I clearly know how to solve this in the backend (some python scripts, c++ code, and so on).   My question is, along with flask now, what else should I learn to build a really functional and aesthetically nice-looking ""frontend""?

We've got to keep this guy motivated on continuing to put out home-run hitting series like this.  ...  pretty please. :-).  I am a Patreon and automatically donate every month.

I started out learning Python around six months back. Before that I was writing code (professionally and personally) in Java for the better part of last 7 years. Like God's gift, I came across this channel few months back and started with the Python fundamentals series. Then one series led to another and six months after, today I code in Python at work (after almost 5 years of coding in Java professionally) and feel very passionately about it doing it and learning it.   I feel, the way you teach is the way programming should be taught. You have the perfect examples, the best explanation, great preparation and quality direction in your videos. I have recommended your channel to a number of my friends and colleagues and everyone has thanked me for that. Got to say that, you have a rare quality of connecting to a very diverse audience.   Even tough, I had started learning django couple of times, I could never finish the courses due to lack of all of the things that you excel at in those courses. However, I had no intention of learning Flask. But today after finish all the videos in this series I feel like great. I know, all these sound cheesy, but I feel, I had to THANK YOU.",True
