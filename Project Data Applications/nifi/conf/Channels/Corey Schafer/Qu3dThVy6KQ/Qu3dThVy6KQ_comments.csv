Suppose you wish to get the number of files in your directory and also store them in a new file. Intuitively, you may come up with something as this, ls -l > listOfFiles.txt | wc -l But there's a problem. All the output of ls -l is redirected to creating listOfFiles.txt file. So, the first part works really well. And there's for there's nothing 'left' to redirect to the 'wc -l' command, since, redirection to a file doesn't really return anything.   To achieve what we wanted to achieve, we pass the output of ls -l to 'tee'. Tee does two things, writes to the file whose name is mentioned after the tee command and also sends it to command that comes after.  ls -l  |  tee listOfFiles.txt  |  wc -l  This would display the number of lines that ls - l outputs,  while at the same time writing the list of files to the file 'listOfFiles.txt'. Once you get what it's trying to achieve it becomes easier to apply. Just remember when you send something to tee, it would split it two ways, 1) to the file, 2) to the next command in place.",True

@HappyAnimals3D,2019-02-02T05:21:53Z,0,"Hi Corey, Just a quick query, something I couldn't figure out myself. Using an iterator (file reader), is it possible to search random lines (picked from another list which is not sorted)? If it is possible I will append those lines to a new list which will house all my randomly selected questions from a text file.",True
@nurashams4093,2019-01-30T08:54:06Z,0,"hello, brother Corey . i have some issue with groupby function. the issue is in the data (people) list if i mix the position among dictionaries , i means not maintaining the sequences of states name , the function doesn't group them properly rather  generates individual iterable function objects for each dictionary , it should have group them together..   in case of  {         'name': 'John Doe',         'city': 'Gotham',         'state': 'NY'     },     {         'name': 'Corey Schafer',         'city': 'Boulder',         'state': 'CO'     },     {         'name': 'Jane Doe',         'city': 'Kings Landing',         'state': 'NY'     }, the function doesn't group them..rather returns individual iterable objects",True

@festivalofcolorsholinyc9031,2018-11-18T22:03:46Z,54,tee is like a T is a pipe (like with fluid in it). It's an analogy with unix piping. On *nix you can: Command1 | tee file.txt | command2  And it will pipe the output of command1 to tee which will write it to the file 'file.txt' and in turn pipe  it to command2.,True

@iamtimmo,2018-11-14T22:51:55Z,9,"‚ÄúTee‚Äù almost certainly comes from the Unix/Linux command of the same name. The name plays on the Unix concept of pipes as I/O plumbing and represents a tee plumbing fitting[1] that divides a single incoming flow into two or more output flows (in plumbing, it can do the opposite, too, and combine multiples into one). In the Unix case, tee takes input on STDIN and outputs it to both STDOUT and the file (or files) given as its arguments.   [1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping_and_plumbing_fitting#Tee",True
