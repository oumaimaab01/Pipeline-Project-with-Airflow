@ass8ash,2018-08-10T00:05:21Z,1,"Awesome! I loved both Sublime and Atom, but mostly used Sublime since it's more lightweight than Atom. Atom pretty much matched every feature sublime had..but ever since I found Teletype on Atom I've been using that a lot. Correct me if I am wrong but I think Atom has a lot more open source packages that you can install and manage.   PS: I know you Vim geniuses are smirking at us",True
