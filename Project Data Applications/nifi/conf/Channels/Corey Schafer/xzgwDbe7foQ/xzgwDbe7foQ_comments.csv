@harleyburton8731,2021-02-28T01:00:49Z,0,"Good information. Thank you. Very disappointed with the Linux Subsystem for Windows though. The first thing I tried to install was arping, as a quick test to see what level of access to the network interfaces the subsystem has. Didn't even manage to get it installed because DNS resolution broke after the first download, so it wasn't able to resolve the repo address. Apparently, it's a well known issue with a less than perfect workaround, and has been for over a year, so I don't think this project is a priority for Microsoft. Sad. As shells go, it's hard to beet Powershell, but it will take a long time to catch up with all the utilities available to Linux/Bash. I've heard a lot of arguments that, given .Net, you can do most anything with Powershell, and I don't disagree, but if it takes what is effectively a script to do it, it isn't exactly as convenient as one of the hundreds of simple utilities that we get out of the box on nearly every Linux distro. Maybe Microsoft will dedicate some time to adding to all the convenient aliases and Cmdlets that emulate them (like cat and a few others that currently exist).",True
