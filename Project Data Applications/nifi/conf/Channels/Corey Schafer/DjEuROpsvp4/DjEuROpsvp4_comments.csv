There is a setup I have tried that requires Git, terminal-plus and uses the windows CMD window - I tried to set that up but the console window interpolated itself all over my code and nothing would work except a non blinking cursor - I ended up deleting the package. Too hard for this little bear. A great shame, because the whole Atom IDE is very elegant and configurable. I have gone back to using IDLE and Replit.

@davidcarter8932,2020-06-24T18:03:03Z,0,"Your videos are great. I implemented many of the features you described in this video (after a little effort with PATH which I was able to deal with from one of your other videos). Anyway, I have a couple of problems with autopep8 and  linter. Both seem a little... (how shall I put it) pedantic (read anal). Both work well for what they are supposed to do, but they go overboard. I think I need to know if there are any settings I could make to mitigate these problems.  After processing some code (which previously worked) with autopep8 it would not run. I finally located the problem. there was a space between the % and B for example in a date formatting statement. I am certain I didn't change it, because it was at all %, and I would remember doing that. I can only assume that autopep8 put it there because it appeared to need a space after a mod operator. After I corrected the change, the code ran again, and when I saved it the ""correction"" was not made again.  Linter gives me so many errors they are overwhelming, and this is in code that will run the way it is. Most are line length errors. I have a lot of print statements with f-strings. Many are a little too long. I have not found a way to continue to the next line without an error. \ in the middle of an f-string causes an error. elements enclosed in () are supposed to be able to be continued on the next line without a continuation character, but that doesn't work either. The long lines run okay, so this is apparently a visual concern. It also wants me to us ""is"" instead of == at statements comparing logical elements. I changed some of them and it worked, but I don't trust ""is"". I watched your ""is"" == video. It was good. It could have used some examples for when to use which. I will comment over there also.  Are there any settings to tone down the intensity of the action of these two utilities? Like ""ignore long lines"" or something like that?",True

I have to admit though, I find people like you who don't like autocomplete a little weird. :p (I mean that in the nicest, most jocular way possible.)

It answers the question ""What did that function do again?"" quickly, and it also nudges me to document stuff, even if I'm just doing it for funzies. (I have a really selective memory. Quick on the uptake, but I'll forget most of whatever it is by tomorrow, probably...what was I talking about again?)",True
