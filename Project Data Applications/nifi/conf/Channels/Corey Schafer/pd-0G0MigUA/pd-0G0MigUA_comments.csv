I believe it won't surprise you if I point out your teaching technique (which I noticed in the OOP playlist) where you first show what will happen by hardcoding the data and only then show what must be done for this to happen dynamically.. .did I notice correctly?   Anyway, I think it's excellent! Now that I understand a little and have some ability to express creativity in code, I notice that a lot of what passes for tutorial on YouTube is just a guy reading the documentation or following something like W3Schools (which I used and still use, it helps a lot).which is ok, everyone does what they want in the way they can, but I think it's important to mention when you find someone who makes effective educational content, usually because they have real experience working and solving the ""real life"" situations.

Say, 10 numerical data are uploaded and I would like to get average of it.  Only way I can think of is to SELECT * and do the math as a part of.... say tkinter gui. (which is client side I guess)   I just have no idea if the python code goes up onto the site as one of many files to do the job up there.  That was what I thought when I heard ""server side"".   Please give me some insights and direction to move.  I doubt Flask or Django are not where I should turn to.",True

I tried to call the apply_raise method in the Employee class,  code looks like this. and I've modified the apply_raise() method so that it returns self.pay*raise_amount.  Do you know why it sets pay to 'None' every time I call this function?  def update_pay(emp):     with conn:         c.execute(""UPDATE emp_list SET pay = :pay where first=:first and last=:last"",                   {'pay':emp.apply_raise(), 'first':emp.first, 'last':emp.last})",True
