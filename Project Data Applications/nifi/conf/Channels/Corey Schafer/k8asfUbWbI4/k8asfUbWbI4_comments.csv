Thank you so much for wonderful videos with such a great explanation. I have a request for you...

@seangreenlund2044,2019-02-17T07:39:01Z,1,"Corey you kick ass at teaching and making good videos. Just last night I decided I wanted to get into coding. I've watched many videos that show basics of it- like how to write lines and what to put in the lines for each language. However, even though those are helpful to learn what to input, you're the first to clearly show what the output is. Very satisfying to see the code actually put to work and it really helps me to understand how to apply code to real application. Love your videos. You get right to the point and explain in a very clear and concise manner. Keep it up",True

@timothybloxsome5802,2018-09-15T05:26:01Z,3,"Great Video, as always. Thanks a lot!  Just a minor issue though, using the calculations in the video here, the annual interest rate would actually exceed 0.13 per year. To convert an annual interest rate to an effective periodic rate (e.g. monthly rate), you don't divide by 12, instead take the 12th root. In this case:  interest_charge = (((interest_rate + 1) ** (1/12)) - 1) * balance  Thanks again for making brilliant Python lessons!",True
