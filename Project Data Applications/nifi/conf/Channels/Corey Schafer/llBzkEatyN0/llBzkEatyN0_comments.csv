@marapetsani7527,2016-12-13T11:41:01Z,2,"thank YOU!!! i have looked all over youtube for good python tutorials and i have to say you are probably the best. You sir are very good at explaining complicated terms &  issues with just the right amount of information needed so that we dont get lost. I also like that you usually give a number of examples so that we can have a solid first understanding of your subject but at the same time  keeping your videos below 20 - 30 min (otherwise it would get tiring). Anything more you can give us on python (tutorials for specific  modules, django tutorial etc ) would be great... i intend to go through all the videos on your channel, just because you are such a great teacher",True
