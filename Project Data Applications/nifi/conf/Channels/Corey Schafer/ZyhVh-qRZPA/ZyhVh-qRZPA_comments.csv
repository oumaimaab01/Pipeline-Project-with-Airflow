@Marek-zt9fy,2020-01-09T19:01:49Z,0,"Hey Corey (and the community, of course)! Quick unrelated question: Is it wise to let people access the /media/(file name, only using images on my page) url? I would store Images for my blog there, and (as far as I know, please correct me if I'm wrong) people could not right click the image and open it in a new tab to save it if I don't allow the URL outside of DEBUG=True, is that right? I would like for people to be able to open and save the images, I'm happy if they like them (these are landscape photos taken by me). So is it wise to let people actually access them, or are there any loopholes through which people could kill my page?   Thank you very much for your reply.",True
