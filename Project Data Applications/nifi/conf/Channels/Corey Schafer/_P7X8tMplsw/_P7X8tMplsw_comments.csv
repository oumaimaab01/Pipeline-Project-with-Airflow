@malmigona1734,2019-10-17T19:18:30Z,1,"Dear Corey. I am finding your tutorials quite interesting but with respect to this one I feel disappointed. What you are showing is not a proper way to analyze any data because with significant effort comes quite basic results. I have expected you to show first of all the process of recoding the ""verbal"" data into numeric one (transforming the answer into numerical representation) than adding description layer (assigning labels to questions and answers) and only then star the proper data analysis including but not limited to: frequencies, crosstabulations, statistical tests, correlations and maybe even data clustering. I fully understand it is a long shot but I guess the impact on small series ""How to proper analyze data in Python"" would be much better that just one clip that shows something...rather not very usefull from the perspective of data science.",True

I have a few suggestions for future videos around the Blog Website that involve some ML and Data Science:  1. Introduce 'like and comment'  functionality to the application which allows a user to comment and like posts by other users.  2. Then, integrate a recommendation system engine to the Blog application, the system will recommend content to the individual user based on his own posts and the posts that he has liked.  3. Also, a user can look into the profile of other users and see a word cloud of all posts that the other has submitted, this way they can get a rough idea of what the other uses posts.
