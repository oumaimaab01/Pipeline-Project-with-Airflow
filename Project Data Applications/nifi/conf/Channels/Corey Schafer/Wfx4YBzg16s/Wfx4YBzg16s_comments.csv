@andrei31112,2022-03-14T13:52:02Z,1,"If you happen to delete the site.db and want to add your own db, you can add the following code to your run.py:  from flaskblog import create_app from flaskblog import db  app = create_app()  with app.app_context():     db.create_all()     db.session.commit()  if __name__ == '__main__':     app.run(debug=True)  My rationale for adding this to the run.py is the following (and I might the wrong). The app is created using the factory pattern: since we use app_context(), the db is created within the context correct app. You could run this inside the __init__.py, but you will get circular import references so you would have to do ugly imports at the bottom of the __init__.py just before return app.   If there is no file called site.db in your flaskblog folder, the above code will create it. If there is a site.db file, it will ignore the code. If you don't initialize the db after creating the app, your app will crash when you call it in the browser as the following statement in the home route cannot execute on an empty posts table.      posts = Post.query.order_by(         Post.date_posted.desc()).paginate(page=page, per_page=5)   The error you will get without the db initialization added to run.py is the following:  sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: post [SQL: SELECT post.id AS post_id, post.title AS post_title, post.date_posted AS post_date_posted, post.content AS post_content, post.user_id AS post_user_id  FROM post ORDER BY post.date_posted DESC  LIMIT ? OFFSET ?] [parameters: (5, 0)] (Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/14/e3q8)  You could probably also condition on the posts table being available and then pass on empty posts to the template in your home route, if the condition is not met, but I think it's not required or not as clean.",True

If you are going to work directly inside the Python interpreter and not from a script, the first method would be more easy to work with... instead of ""with"" ;).",True

@nickbejan4914,2018-06-14T15:05:25Z,20,Great tutorial series! Can't wait for the unit tests for this app tutorial ^^,True
@AbhishekNigam,2018-06-01T20:35:16Z,3,"I am so grateful to you for this video!! Seriously, for a beginner like me, it can take few years to learn all of this, how to architect your app, how to use different configurations in local development and in production. Thanks a lot! Bless you.",True
@loveboatcaptain77,2018-05-31T21:30:10Z,9,"hey corey... thx for this awesome quick guide into flask. as i just discovered it for myself it's great to get this nice overview. since i'm still learning python as a hobby i'm struggling in integrating Flask-Admin and Flask-Security to have some basic rights and role management and a nice view for the database. could you please consider adding a part for integrating these extensions too? i think that might be useful for extending this awesome video-tutorial. i'm also very interested in a basic unit-test or selenium-test integration tutorial for this project. also a serializer for an api integration would be awesome... like Flask-Marshmallow... so many ideas but i'm a little to unexperienced to get it all working, all together. this would give me a perfect playgroud to teach myself some new stuff and extend this project for my own needs and learn even more... :D as a very first customization i was able to integrate ckeditor for the TextArea in the Post.Content... this might be usefull for others to... perhaps another video idea for you and this series. my next plans are rights and roles, testing, add images for Posts, categories and tags and of course some other post-types, like pages or media view. thank you for inspiring me with every video you post... that i wanted to post under very of your videos... but this seems a little childish :D  really dude... thank you very much... you teached me very well. some coins for more coffee are on the way :)",True

@jorjolandes,2018-05-14T00:19:10Z,2,"Hello Corey, great tutorial!! I have a question, in which order the files are executed when we execute the command ""python run.py""? (the main ones)",True
@ayder,2018-05-13T21:29:40Z,2,..and with all the pain Flask project now became like Django,True
@jtown4118,2018-05-13T20:42:33Z,13,"I enjoyed this video series and look forward to watching more  of your python videos.  For anyone that was confused on how to access your sqlite database tables from the python interpreter to run queries or make modifications after changing the flask app over to blueprints, should now run the following commands listed below inside the python interpreter.    **Make sure you're in your flaskblog directory before invoking the python interpreter to run the commands listed below.  >>> from flaskblog import create_app >>> from flaskblog.__init__ import db >>> from flaskblog.models import current_app, User, Post >>> app = create_app() >>> app.app_context().push() >>> print (app)  # Now you can run queries against your database. >>> User.query.all() >>> Post.query.all()  Also, if you want to utilize a GUI to access your db info instead of using the python interpreter you can use sqlite browser (see link below).

@playgoods,2018-05-11T22:53:30Z,0,wonderful,True
@ShanLin03,2018-05-11T04:13:40Z,11,I think your __init__.py didn't include the db.create_all() for clean setup. I suggest adding after  app.register_blueprint(main)  with app.app_context():         db.create_all()  return app,True
@pavelklammert7777,2018-05-08T17:54:03Z,1,"Hi. why not -> from flask_blog import create_app ""as app"" ,so we don't have to change anything in code itself? Any issues?",True
@wolfisraging,2018-05-05T04:11:32Z,1,Where were you? Glad to see you again,True
