@DarrenSemotiuk,2021-06-10T21:21:34Z,1,"Thanks! Very helpful! I just did the same thing in my Windows version of SublimeText 3, and added annotations to explain each line for Future Me: // ALT-LeftClick to 'Goto Definition' // filename:		""Default (Windows).sublime-mousemap"" // inside this path:	""<sublime root>\Data\Packages\User"" [{ 	""button"": ""button1"",		// button1 = LEFT mouse click 	""count"": 1,			/* 2 would make DOUBLE-click required (hmmm...) */ 	""modifiers"": [""alt""],		// ALT not CTRL (since CTRL = multi-select, Sublime's BEST feature!) 	""press_command"": ""drag_select"",	// will auto-expand to the full token (e.g. function name) 	""command"": ""goto_definition"",	// Where The Magic Happens, ""Goto Definition"" = another of Sublime's best features  }]",True
