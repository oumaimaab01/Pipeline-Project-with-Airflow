@kevincalderon7349,2023-06-21T23:55:33Z,1,I have a question. I don't know anything about python or coding. I started taking Python for Everyone on Coursera. I'm reading the book that the course is based on. I know that the process of learning a new language will take time and effort but when I was watching a Youtube video and it was explaining that the best way to learn is actually writing code and constantly practicing coding and not having to learn every single thing. I saw a video on optimizing Chat GPT for Python I saw that one of the  free resources recommended was Corey Schafer. I saw his first video and it was so amazing that I think I might be wasting my time doing the Coursera course. What would someone with experience recommend? My concern is that I have limited time and want to be effective while learning.,True

@iluvuvibez6644,2022-03-12T23:34:43Z,1,"NOTES  EXAMPLES  String - if you have a apostophe like in the example below, it's not going to work instead you have to do this 'Bobby\'s World', it's always better to use double quotation marks.  message = 'Bobby's World' print(message)  Multi-line - use 3 quotations marks if you want to use multiple lines  message = """"""Bobby's World was a good cartoon in the 1990s"""""" print(message)  Length - not printing the message but the length of it which in this case is 11, no quotes as it is using length keyword.  message = 'Hello World' print(len(message))   To find the location, the index will always be 0 print(message[0])  range of characters/slicing - the 0 will include the value, but the 5 will not, will print 0-4 excluding the 5th. The colon means it stopping point. if you just put [:5], still get the same thing. If you just use [:], it will print your string. print(message[0:5])  Lower/Upper case - when run a .lower, it will be all lowercase. Same thing with .upper, all uppercase.  message = 'Hello World' print(message.lower())  Count - it takes a string as a arguement  message = 'Hello World' print(message.count('Hello'))  Find - it will take a string as an arguement as well message = 'Hello World' print(message.find('World'))  Replace - It takes 2 arguements  message = 'Hello World' message = message.replace('World', 'Universe') print(message)  Catinating (Adding strings together) -   greeting = 'Hello' name = 'Harry' message = greeting + ', ' + name print(message)  Formatted String (FASTER and less confusing)  message = '{}, {}. Welcome!'.format(greeting, name)  OR  message = f'{greeting}, {name}. Welcome!'",True

You keep it simple, give good insights into why and how things work, show good examples that illustrate the key points well, present nicely and cleanly, and you anticipate a lot of questions and answer them later in the same video.
