I'm trying to create a number generator in a sort of unconventional way. So after watching this video I came up with 2 approaches and I'm getting sort of the results that I want, but it's incomplete and I don't know where to go next.   Approach 1  col1 = [1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,13,16] col2 = [2,4,5,6,7,9,11,13,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,22] col3 = [7,8,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,23,24,25,27,29,30] col4 = [9,12,17,18,19,20,22,23,24,25,26,28,30,31,33] col5 = [20,21,24,25,26,28,30,32,33,34,35] b1 = [1,3,5,7,8] b2 = [2,4,6,7,9,10,11,12]  drum1 = random.sample(col1 + col2 + col3 + col4 + col5, k=5) drum2 = random.sample(b1 + b2, k=2) draw1 = random.sample(drum1, k=5) draw2 = random.sample(drum2, k=2) main_draw = draw1 + draw2 main_draw  [30, 13, 28, 5, 30, 2, 4]  Approach 2   for num in range(4):     first = random.choice(col1)     second = random.choice(col2)     third = random.choice(col3)     forth = random.choice(col4)     fifth = random.choice(col5)     bonus1 = random.choice(b1)     bonus2 = random.choice(b2)     draw = f'{first} {second} {third} {forth} {fifth} {bonus1} {bonus2}'     print(draw)  7 6 7 23 21 5 2 13 11 14 20 30 8 9 4 6 23 17 20 5 11 5 22 23 23 20 7 11  In one I used the .choice and the other .sample. 1. My first goal is to get unique random numbers from the range of numbers I manually enter and not from say, random(1,30). I would like to give it the numbers I want it to rand between. But I want each number to be unique and as you can see from the results, that's not the case.  2. My second goal is to develop this further so that from the numbers I provide in each column as you noticed, some of the numbers in different columns are the same, I want it that way, however, I would also like it to count up, so if it chose 7 from col1 then it should start from a number greater than 7 in col2 and if it is, say 10, then it should choose one of the numbers in col3 that is greater than 10 and so on until col5.   Can you please help me? Thank you",True

I happened to stumble onto your video and realized that I needed to make the code into smaller pieces rather than larger ones. I was trying to have the random function that I was using do more things than it was designed to and thus kept getting an error of some sort. When I first wrote it, I couldn't get the program to loop and then if I had to roll higher than the numbers present it ran into an error due to population size so I had to find how replacement worked. Now it works. However, it has ""none"" twice when the program ends but that is minor. I believe it is because of my while loop and having to place return at the end in order for the loop to exit when I have do not have anymore rolls to do.  Thank you again!",True
