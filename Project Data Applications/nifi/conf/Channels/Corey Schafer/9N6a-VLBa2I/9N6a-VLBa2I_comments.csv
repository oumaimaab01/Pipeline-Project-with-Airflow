@MrRenaissance17,2021-11-13T22:29:24Z,0,"This is a great video it really helped me understand more about JSON, especially in correlation with python. I have a couple questions that hopefully you (Or anyone in the comment section) would be willing to clarify for me.   1) At the 5:47 mark in your initial python code, you delete the [phone] out of the [people] array and then you stored the new version under a variable that you assign JSON.dump(data). Rather than assigning a new variable could you have just printed out the people string? Would the change have been reflective on the people string? 2) At the 19:25 mark you've already created an empty dictionary and you've assigned the price variable to a list in the usd_rates dictionary called name. The ""USD/INR"" automatically converted the currency without you actually writing a conversion formula. Is this a pre-built function of Python or was the conversion written elsewhere?",True

Also 8:14 as illustrated at 13:30 another way you can get the JSON to a workable str is by using 'json.loads(some_file.read())' but the .load method is preferred and 1 less step.

Similarly, there are errors @18:55 and @19:12 while demonstrating conversion of 50 USD to Euro and Indian Rupees, respectively, instead of what it should have been, 50 Euros and 50 Indian Rupees to USD.   Also, @ 11:19 he said the command he'd run earlier deleted the phone number but it was the area_codes. The phone number deletion was for the people json at the beginning of the video.

@VlasTrunov,2020-02-12T20:35:06Z,0,"Hi Corey! First of all, thanks for putting things clear and concise way. Why won't you create a hands-on course on Udemy?    In this video you have covered the way how to manipulate json data back and forth and you also mentioned it may be useful to run such python request on a regular basis to collect time series. But why would I want to use json as a source? I just can't imagine a real case.    I am a newbie in Python, and I am trying to move forward from basic stuff like tuples and strings to something more substantial. I have this question because I am trying to feed json data directly to a mysql database and then process is using pandas and numpy. The problem I have is that once I feed the dataset to mysql, the columns in mysql are titled by the names of the values in json. E.g. for a flight there is an origin and a destination, and once I post the values for, say, MOW and LED, the columns in the database are initialized with values MOW and LED. Next time i run df.to_sql(""tickets"", engine, index=True, if_exists='append') for a different set of values, say, MOW and JFK, i get 'Unknown column 'data.JFK.0.price' in 'field list' error. I guess that this happens because to_sql method is searching for a specific column name to match the json value.   Do you have a video on how to get json and mysql to be friends?)) Or would you point to a good source of knowlege, please? And again, do you think that mysql is a good way to store and operate data further with python? Or would you advise to store everything in json, sqlite or redis?    Thanks again.  (Subscribed)",True

@ojwilks,2018-10-30T19:48:31Z,0,"Thanks for this. I know a little Python but still probably considered beginner to somewhat..  The first part of the tutorial went really nice as it gets me part way through a challenge I am working on. Writing my function called 'update_drive_uuid', I got through my step of  "" for drive in data[""Drives""][""Drive""]  "" (in my script)  and I can print all that data fine that I want to see from the json, by adding:  slot_in_file = drive[""Slot""]  and:  wwid_in_file = [""WWID""]  and printing those.  I am trying to figure out how to take some other data I pulled into the same function, from a command run on the same server (which I can also print it just fine too), and I'm trying to take two WWID strings taken from that server command and replace them into two of the four WWID fields in the 'Drive' sections in 'Drives' of the existing json file...   The server command I run pulls a Device number like 0,1,2 lining up with a real WWID for each one, while the json file has a 'Drive' section (in Drives) which each have their own Slot number (0,20,1-0,1-1) and each have a unique WWID in their respective section.   I'm trying to copy from the command's WWID string (for a device number) to a specific WWID field of a desired 'Slot' field in the json, like example: Device 1 WWID (in command) edits to: Slot 20 (in json file WWID), and Device 2 WWID (in command) edits to: Slot 0 (in json file WWID).. (those are the only 2 drive WWIDs I'm trying to edit in the json). NOTE that the devices numbers on server do NOT line up with the Slot numbers in json file (long story, I'm virtualizing something)...  I'm stuck for 2 weeks on this, reading every Python tutorial I can find... I can print all the data I want pretty clean from the server command and can print all of what I want to see from the json file, but am trying to figure out proper way to write the real values I want from the command and update the existing fields into  json file accordingly.   Do you do personal tutoring sessions for $$$? Or do you already have a video explaining how to take some value from a command output and put it into an existing json file which already has the field there? Or even a good link to some article covering this. I really want to master Python but it can be frustrating in the beginning...",True

@sagshah10,2017-11-20T22:46:06Z,1,"Hi Corey, Awesome video once again, always a pleasure learning more about python from you.  I have recently been using alot of the JSON module in python for some projects.  I just wanted to say, one thing I feel that is missed in this video, that I wanted to point out was, is that for this video you used the ""for loop"" to loop through data within within an array found within the JSON, and then access data based on keys you already know.  But on recents projects I have worked on, I dynamically generate JSON dictionary key and value pairs based on information collected via webscraping, to save the data locally.  And for that instance, in order for me to identify all the keys and values within the generated dictionary, i use the following for loop :  for k, v in d.items():    #k = Key, v = value and d = dictionary        print (k + "": "", v)  something like this.  What do you think.   Hope you like this and keep up the awesome videos.",True
