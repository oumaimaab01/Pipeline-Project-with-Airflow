@coreyms,2019-11-19T01:51:16Z,96,"I figured out why my zip download doesn't work in this video. It's because the link is opening the zip file within their Google Drive instead of actually downloading the file. If we had used this link then it would have worked: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV  Also, I know many people are eagerly awaiting my Pandas series. I am done with the first 4 videos of the series and almost done with the rest! I should get some time to work more on that series when I go home for Thanksgiving, so I hope to have it released in the next couple of weeks!",True
