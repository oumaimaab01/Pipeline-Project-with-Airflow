@henricattoire8507,2017-12-16T13:27:56Z,0,"Hi, I downloaded Kali Linux (2017.3) and latest version of virtual box. Everything works but when I try to use the apt-get install -y virtual box-guest-x11, I get this back:  E: Could not obtain lock / var / lib / dpkg / lock - open (11: resource is temporarily unavailable) E: Can not lock the control folder (/ var / lib / dpkg /). Is it in use by another process?  I translated it from dutch, so it could be a bit different when you get it in English. What can I do?",True
