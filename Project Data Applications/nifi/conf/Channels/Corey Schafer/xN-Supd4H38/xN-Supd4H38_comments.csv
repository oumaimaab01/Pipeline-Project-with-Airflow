@coreyms,2019-06-13T15:04:31Z,36,I hope everyone finds this video helpful. The next video of the series will be posted tomorrow at the same time. The next video will cover filling areas on line plots. We'll cover basic fills and also how to conditionally fill different regions based on certain thresholds.  I'd like to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this series. If you'd like to check them out then you can sign up with this link and get 20% off your premium subscription: https://brilliant.org/cms,True
