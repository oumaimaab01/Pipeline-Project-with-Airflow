However, the JSON file contains user_id of 1, 2, and 3, so I basically tried to upload a post to an unexisting user.

@Oskyyyyyy,2019-01-22T16:27:51Z,1,I have a problem with posts ordered by author. Like in your video in 33:15 to 33:45 I get all posts(12) even after small changes in views.py like getqueryset. I noticed that when I click on the user id it getting user id from Url but the first posts that I see are mine and then I see the users posts no matter which user I chose(they are always sorted by Me>NewUser>NewUser2>NewUser3). I also didn't use JSON file with posts but make them through the page and maybe it cause some problems(also sorry for my bad English xd).,True
