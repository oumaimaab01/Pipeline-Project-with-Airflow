@MyTube4Utoo,2017-11-26T15:43:46Z,20,"Another great video Corey! BTW, you mentioned edX. CS50 (Harvard), through edX, is totally free, extremely educational, and very enjoyable. It's supposedly Harvard's most popular course, and I can see why. The professor, David Malan, is very knowledgeable, passionate, and makes learning fun. Highly recommended!  Love your channel Corey. I'm 58, and had pretty much given up on ever learning to program, but your videos have inspired me to give it another shot. I just found your channel a couple of days ago, but I've learned A LOT! Your instruction is second to none. Not everyone makes a good teacher, regardless of how much they know, but you have 'something.'  *THANK YOU!*",True
