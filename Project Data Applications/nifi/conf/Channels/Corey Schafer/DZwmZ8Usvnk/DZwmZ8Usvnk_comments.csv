@marcello4258,2021-10-31T19:55:45Z,0,as from what I've understood. Initializing a variable by setting it to another value ( value_a = value_b ) just give the pointer as if value b changes so does value a. But how do you copy the data (which seems to be in the heap) to the new object so that it has its own data which is not depended anymore and therefore stays the same even if value b changes.,True
@amandaahringer7466,2021-10-31T15:37:49Z,0,Found something interesting that I didn't realize after doing some testing.

I managed to use np.sum(np.where(a == 0)[0]) == 0 as a condition, but I wonder if there are smarter ways of checking for this.... many thanks for helping if you can :)",True

THE CONDITION IS NEITHER TRUE OR FALSE. The reason why it print ""Evaluated is False"" in your code is because you use the ""else"" statement. It just means that the condition is NOT TRUE. It turns out that 1 is True and 0 is False and that's it. Please try this code:  condition = 10 if condition == True:     print('Condition is true') elif condition == False:     print('Condition is false') elif condition == None:     print('Condition is none')  It prints nothing, same for empty List,...
