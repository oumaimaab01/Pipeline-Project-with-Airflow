@coreyms,2023-05-21T16:52:48Z,279,"Hey everybody. I'm trying something new and would like your feedback after the video is uploaded. I get a LOT of comments each day on older videos and it's impossible for me to answer them all. So today, I'm going to try uploading a YouTube premiere for the first time. The only big difference between a premiere and a regular upload is that I'll be able to hop into a live chat with you all during the launch of the video and do my best to answer questions that way (as long as they're not coming in too quickly). I'll never schedule these premieres far in advance because personally, as a person who watches a lot of YouTube myself, I hate waiting once the premiere is announced. So I'll always schedule these just a few hours before the video is live so that the wait isn't too long. I do this with regular uploads as well because I like to make sure the video is fully processed and that there are no issues. Sooo long story short, I would love your feedback after the video launches today and to let me know if you enjoyed it better than a normal upload, if you were indifferent, or if you weren't a fan of the premiere style.",True

Here are a few:  Corey Schafer: Corey's channel is a fantastic resource for developers of all skill levels. His Python tutorials are thorough, clear, and incredibly well-structured. He covers everything from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics like decorators, context managers, and generators.  Programming with Mosh: Mosh Hamedani is a professional trainer and software engineer who provides high-quality programming tutorials, including a comprehensive Python course for beginners. His explanations are straightforward and concise, making complex concepts easy to understand.  CS Dojo: Run by YK Sugi, CS Dojo offers a range of content on Python. He covers fundamental programming concepts as well as more practical, problem-solving techniques. His explanations are beginner-friendly and engaging.  Socratica: They produce high-quality educational content on a variety of subjects, including Python programming. Their Python tutorials are concise and professionally produced, making it easy for beginners to learn the basics.  sentdex: Sentdex (Harrison Kinsley) covers a wide range of Python topics, from the basics to more advanced tutorials on specific libraries and applications, such as web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, and more.  TheNewBoston: Bucky Roberts' channel has a series of more than 40 Python tutorials that are easy to follow and cover a wide range of topics. Although the Python series is a bit dated, it's still a good resource for beginners.  Remember that YouTube is just one of many resources available for learning Python.

The binary string ""1000101110010111001011100001"" translates to the English phrase ""Time"",  Its answer is completely wrong   Here is what it explained to me how it had done it  How did you do it?  the AI: To translate the binary string ""1000101110010111001011100001"" into English, I used the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding scheme. In ASCII, each character is represented by a unique 7-bit binary code.  Breaking down the binary string into groups of 7 bits each, we have:  ""1000101"" - corresponds to the ASCII code for the letter 'T' ""1101110"" - corresponds to the ASCII code for the letter 'i' ""0101110"" - corresponds to the ASCII code for the letter 'm' ""1010001"" - corresponds to the ASCII code for the letter 'e'  Combining these characters, we get ""Time"", which is the English translation of the binary string.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The reason why  it was unable to decode it correctly is that it could not understand that when the leading digit of 1 byte or 8 bit data is a zero,  0 can be omitted, without affecting the mathematical value of the data. In that case, i purposely left out all the 4 leading zeros of the piece of the 4 byte data---> = 32bits -4 bits = 28 bits, and it divided 28 by 4 to result in 4 groups of 7 bits, and miscalculated the decimal values, which led to wrong conversions into English text letters, and it was unable to distinguish the difference between a word and a phrase in English language, and that's why it called the noun ""time"" as a phrase  The Ai  can write codes in different HL languages, which are the hybrids between human communicative languages and mathematical expressions, but when it comes to the machine language, it seems to have difficulties with really understand binary programming language",True

@vansf3433,2023-06-09T05:57:23Z,0,"Here is its explanation about quantum computer:  Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum physics to process and store information. Traditional computers, like the one you're using now, use bits to represent and process information. A bit can be either a 0 or a 1, like a light switch that's either on or off.  In quantum computing, however, the basic unit of information is called a qubit. Unlike bits, qubits can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, thanks to a phenomenon called superposition. It's like having a light switch that can be in multiple states simultaneously, like being both on and off.  This ability of qubits to exist in multiple states at once gives quantum computers a huge advantage over classical computers. It allows them to perform many calculations simultaneously and solve certain problems much faster. It's like having many light switches that can be in different combinations of on and off positions all at once, which can help solve complex problems more efficiently.  Another important concept in quantum computing is entanglement. When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit is connected to the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. It's like having two light switches that are linked so that flipping one switch immediately affects the other, regardless of the distance between them.  By harnessing the power of superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can perform complex calculations and solve problems that are extremely challenging for classical computers. They have the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, drug discovery, optimization, and simulations by providing faster and more efficient solutions.  However, it's worth noting that quantum computing is still an emerging field, and there are many technical challenges to overcome before we have practical and scalable quantum computers. But researchers and scientists are making significant progress, and the potential impact of quantum computing is quite exciting ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  It repeats after human definition like a parrot without detecting the nonsensical idea that ""qubits can be both 0 and 1 at the same time,"" by ignorant individuals who have fundamentally misunderstood the invented mathematical expression for the phenomenon of photon entanglement, which actually means the probability of existence of the 2 opposite states of on and off are equal or the probability of on is 50 %, and the probability of 1 is also  50 %, but not that the different values 0 & 1 of the opposite states can actually overlap",True
@vansf3433,2023-06-09T05:09:55Z,0,"I also gave it a math-problem to see whether it could solve it correctly , but it failed to recognise an error with the mathematical expression, which i had deliberately put it incorrectly to test it Artificial intelligence, and replied with a wrong answer  Here is my question:  Can you please prove 2N! > N^N ?  where N = (0, ‚àû)  Here is the AI answer: To prove that 2N! > N^N for any positive integer N, we can use mathematical induction.  First, let's establish the base case for N = 1: When N = 1, 2N! = 2! = 2, and N^N = 1^1 = 1. Since 2 is greater than 1, the inequality holds for N = 1.  Now, let's assume that the inequality holds for some positive integer k, i.e., 2k! > k^k.  We will prove that the inequality also holds for k + 1: 2(k + 1)! = 2(k + 1)k! = 2(k + 1) * k! > k * k! (since k + 1 > 1) Since k * k! > k^k (our assumption from the induction step), we can conclude that 2(k + 1)! > k^k * (k + 1) = (k + 1)^(k + 1).  By mathematical induction, we have shown that 2N! > N^N for all positive integers N.  It was unable to understand that the mathematical expression 2N! > N^N can be true only when N=1 and that the LHS is missing 2 parentheses ( 2N)! Let's testing its fallacious answer: No other number integer k= 1 between o and infinity can satisfy the inequality Ex, k = 2 ---> 2K! > k^k ---> 2(2!) = 4 > 2^2=4 , which is false k=3---> 2(3!) = 12 > 3^3 = 27 . which is also false k= 5 ----> 2(5!) = 120 > 5^5 = 3125, which is obviously disastrously false Conclusion the chatbot GPT's answer is nonsense, and has failed to pass the exam",True
@vansf3433,2023-06-09T04:32:49Z,0,"I have just tested It with some questions, of which 2 questions are related to current available info, and one is related to the info which has never ever been available in any database of any university, nor any science research institute, nor anywhere else  in the world, and is extracted from a book of natural sciences or STEM which i will publish in a few years. As i had expected  it could answer only questions related to available info, which includes human-invented concepts and data or facts, but it failed miserably to answer the question which is related to only new and correct concepts which will soon replace the current human fundamental misunderstandings of many natural phenomena, due to too much reliance on human invented defective concepts of mathematics and manipulations of the flaws of the concepts of mathematics, and a severe lack of logos and tangible, objective, undeniable facts.  It depends on the current available human-invented  concepts and notions how it answer questions, which means that such AI programmes  are merely replicas of human subjective interpretations. What it can do is to sort out all the needed info, including human-invented definitions & concepts, and data or facts  stored within itself and from from other databases to find  answers to given question far much faster way than human NI can do, but it cannot think of anything new independently by itself. No matter how much different its ways of finding the same correct answers to the same given questions can be from human way of answering the questions, all its answer are always based on the concepts or definitions provided by human subjective interpretations  I said quite a while a go, when Mr. Musk exaggerated the so-called ""AI threat to humanity"", that No AI could ever outdo human NI because it was merely a sort of passive intelligence, totally depending on the inputs of  human-invented concepts to function as  how it had been programmed to serve human purposes, and that such passive electronic brains would become merely pieces of useless junk conductors if human NI came up with new concepts to replace the existing  concepts without updating AI with any of the new ones",True

You can then review them to see if you've missed anything, or if it has any good ideas. For a solo programmer, you can use it as a form of code review.  If you are a team programmer, you can go into a code review prepared.",True

@coreyms,2023-05-21T16:52:48Z,279,"Hey everybody. I'm trying something new and would like your feedback after the video is uploaded. I get a LOT of comments each day on older videos and it's impossible for me to answer them all. So today, I'm going to try uploading a YouTube premiere for the first time. The only big difference between a premiere and a regular upload is that I'll be able to hop into a live chat with you all during the launch of the video and do my best to answer questions that way (as long as they're not coming in too quickly). I'll never schedule these premieres far in advance because personally, as a person who watches a lot of YouTube myself, I hate waiting once the premiere is announced. So I'll always schedule these just a few hours before the video is live so that the wait isn't too long. I do this with regular uploads as well because I like to make sure the video is fully processed and that there are no issues. Sooo long story short, I would love your feedback after the video launches today and to let me know if you enjoyed it better than a normal upload, if you were indifferent, or if you weren't a fan of the premiere style.",True
