Your tutorial was very helpful for me,  and is helping me grasp the language way better now. I have one problem though, I am not able to figure out how to deploy my app to heroku (I am a beginner) and for some reason all the tutorials I try give me some error in the end.

@songokussj4cz,2018-08-09T20:47:43Z,2,"Okay. I like your videos. Really much. But.... 19 minutes and you ended with multiple cursor in 12th minute?!? My god. I thought you will present at least 5-10 items. Truth to be told, I don't even want to imagine an editor without a multiple cursor anymore, it!s the most used thing I do. But in your next series, be a little faster, please. Not fast! :) I like your pace. Mainly. But faster than in this one. Just my opinion. Anyway, good job :)",True
