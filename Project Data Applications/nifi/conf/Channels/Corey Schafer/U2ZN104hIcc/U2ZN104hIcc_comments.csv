The dash in the -e must be escaped with the backslash or the grep command will see it as an argument to itself and not part of the pattern to match.  The cut comment used the character following the -d ( delimiter ) to break the input line into fields and selects those fields, in this case the first field.  Finally the xargs comment feeds the input to another command in a controlled ways such that it will not overwhelm the comment with too many arguments on the shell command line.
