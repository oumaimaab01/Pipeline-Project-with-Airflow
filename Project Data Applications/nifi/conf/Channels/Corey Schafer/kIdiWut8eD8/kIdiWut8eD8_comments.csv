@coreyms,2019-04-15T17:52:01Z,35,"Hey everyone. I spend a good bit of time describing what each script is doing in this video, but you can imagine how fast these installations would go if I just ran the scripts without talking. Using these techniques, I usually have new machines set up exactly how I like them within minutes.  I've updated some of the scripts from this video. I realized afterward that my sublime.sh script didn't include my preferred Keyboard Shortcuts or Anaconda Package settings. Those are now included. These scripts are always evolving so that I can set up machines faster and better each time. I would recommend coming up with your own set of personalized scripts that allow you to do that same. It's a great feeling when you get a new machine and run these scripts, and within minutes you have a machine that has all of your preferred applications and settings.  As far as the Sublime Settings not being set up with my install script, I believe it's possible that the location for the settings isn't created until after Sublime has been opened for the first time, but I'm not 100% sure. There will need to be some more investigation there. But anyways, I hope you all are having a great week!",True

I dont think brew cask install jdk11 would be interpreted by brew as what I think jdk11 is.  How do you make sure it is going to really install jdk11?  Another example, how would I install Eclipse Oxygen 3A for example.  So, how is that ""firefox"" in the command mapped to the correct package you are trying to install?  Thanks",True

@iTechDhaval,2020-03-30T07:31:15Z,0,"Sublime script ran while you executed install script.

@tarasco2010,2020-03-04T04:13:19Z,0,"Hello, I think I realized why it is not working the automatic installation of Sublime Text's packages. I tested on my computer and I think it is because you are putting the ""installed_packages"" on   Preferences.sublime-settings but it should be on Package Control.sublime-settings. I didn't understand why do you have that file as a compressed file, I think maybe it is there the problem. Here is the documentation of Sublime Text Package Control. https://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing I share what i have on that file if it helps you,   {  ""bootstrapped"": true,  ""in_process_packages"":  [  ],  ""installed_packages"":  [   ""A File Icon"",   ""Anaconda"",   ""BracketHighlighter"",   ""Compare Side-By-Side"",   ""JSON Reindent"",   ""Material Theme"",   ""Package Control"",   ""SideBarEnhancements""  ] } Wish it works.

@josephlyons3393,2019-11-27T13:58:50Z,4,"Hey Corey, I‚Äôve been using Homebrew for a few years now to manage my command line tools, but only just recently discovered brew cask, through your last video.  I was fairly excited about the idea of writing a shell script to automate the installation of oh software; even more excited when I saw the list of available software that can be installed through brew cask, which covers 99 percent of what I need.  I then started to wonder how safe this all was.  To my knowledge, these individual brew cask commands are maintained by 3rd party individuals and not the actual companies themselves.  It turns out that the maintainers is Homebrew releases multiple statements of them not screening any potential malware from these brew cask installations and that it is mostly up to you to know this and figure it out.  There have been cases of people bundling malware with the software.  This whole thing sort of turned me off from the idea.  What is your stance on all of this?",True

Anyway, I start a new job soon and I was thinking about all the setup I have to do.  So this video came at the right time.  I've used setup scripts myself for many years, but they've gotten a little out dated.  I like the very simple approach you outline here.  I'm going to go back through my scripts and do some house cleaning.  One thing I wanted to share is that brew has the idea of a Brewfile.  Its similar to a Gemfile in Ruby, or a requirements.txt file in Python.  Check it out.  Do with it what you want.  https://thoughtbot.com/blog/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew",True
