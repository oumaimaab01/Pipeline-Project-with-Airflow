The tutorials for doing this are Greek to me. Corey, oh how we beg thee, please do a tutorial on how you use code in a notebook as a module in another notebook.

I think Anaconda messes with environment variables for some reason and it also still runs python 3.7 rather than python 3.8. Besides for some reason you have to run Anaconda Navigator as administrator on windows 10 in order to avoid a kernel error while using jupyter notebook, which kinda feels like newly installing the Navigator every time I need to run it. For now, Anaconda doesn't even start on my pc, gives some kind of FatalError (probably because I switched to python 3.8 to use with Pycharm), so I uninstalled it, then installed Jupyter notebook through regular pip install and honestly I find this is a way better, easier and faster method.

@dotinsideacircle,2017-09-19T21:27:20Z,0,"Pretty good tutorial. Recommendations (even for noobies): Different Python versions should not be installed in the same location. MacOS default Python2 is located at /usr/bin. And when Python3 is installed via Homebrew it should be installed at /usr/local/bin. Virtual environments¬†should also be used because then Python3 or Python2 packages along with Jupyter can be installed in separate project folders. This way all projects will have their own dependencies, packages and files with zero conflicts. If you decide to change machines or take a project folder to some lab or something else everything just works. As an added bonus, when virtual environments are used Jupyter will automatically be using the correct kernel. e.g. If Jupyter is opened in a Python3 project folder the Jupyter 'New' menu will say Python3 by default. If Jupyter is opened in a Python2 project folder the Jupyter 'New' menu will say Python2 by default.",True

@darthvador3699,2016-09-26T03:10:30Z,0,"Hey Corey, love the videos, great job. You really did teach me a lot and I appreciate the work you put into teaching your audience python in a way that makes a lot of sense. Also, I realized that you're really really good at python so I have a question: K, I made a calculator a few whiles ago but the problem is you have to input a number, press enter to go to the next input, enter the operation, press enter to go to the next input, enter the second number, then press enter for the result. So the equation would look something like this: 5 + 5 = 10 I don't really like that, either that or I'm just looking for a challenge lol. Anyways, I want the user to be able to input this: 5+5 But in order for that to happen you can only have one input code rather than three. So rather than this: num1=float(input("" ""))  symbol=input(""  "")  num2=float(input(""  "")  You would have to have something like this: user=input(""  "")  I guess my question is if the user were to equal '55929+557' how would I define the first number as everything before the symbol and the second number as everything after the symbol. I already know how to identify the symbol itself.  Thank you so much for all the hard work, again, you're a great instructor. If you can't figure it out, or maybe you just don't respond or something, I just need to let you know that you've helped me a lot.",True
