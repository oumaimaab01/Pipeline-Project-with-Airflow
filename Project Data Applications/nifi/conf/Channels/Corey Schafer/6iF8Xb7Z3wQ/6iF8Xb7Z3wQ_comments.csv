Like I said, I've looked a lot of material throughout various websites when it comes to Python learning so I'm surprised I had never known your YouTube channel. I came across your name while going through my Reddit feed and someone had asked a question who is the best Python tutor and your name was on top of the list with an excessive amount of upvotes and after looking you up I can definitely see why that was the case. Your videos are short and to the point and explained in the most simplest of terms; making them easy to grasp and not leaving anyone dumbfounded. Thank you so much providing these videos as they're helping immensely.",True
