Thanks for putting in all the work to make it happen and I will donate to keep you doing more!  The one solution that I didn't find in your videos is how to map data from a secondary dataframe (with similar index, although only containing some overlapping values) to update values in a current dataframe.  A key use for this would be in stock data that is constantly updating, or, in data where you want to keep some kind of historical record of previous values but also access newer ones and possibly create a new series with them.
