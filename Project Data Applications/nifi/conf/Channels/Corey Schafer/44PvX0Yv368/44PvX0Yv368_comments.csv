Solution to this, is moving the models User/Post import to below the `db = SQLAlchemy(app)` line.    - [9:50](https://youtu.be/44PvX0Yv368?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&t=591) The answer to error #1 is:     1. Create a new folder in project folder with same name as application. 'flaskblog' in this case.     2. Create a new file in the application/flaskblog folder called `__init__.py`     3. Move forms.py, models.py, static + template folders into the application folder.     4. Edit __init__.py. This is where we initialise the package.         1. Move all the imports (at the top of the page - not the models import) from the flaskblog.py         2. Move also the app, app.config and db initialisation lines.      5. [11:24](https://youtu.be/44PvX0Yv368?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&t=684) Create routes.py file in package folder        1. Paste all the routes + dummy data into this file - everything left but `if __name__ == '__main__'` line     6. Rename the flaskblog.py to run.py as it's only purpose now is to run the application.        7. [12:38](https://youtu.be/44PvX0Yv368?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&t=758) Import the app into the run.py file, so the `app.run` command works by adding `from flaskblog import app`, this will import from the __init__.py file. *The app variable MUST exist within the _init__.py file.*     8. **Routes.py** clean up time:        1. Get the imports sorted for routes. Move the `from flask import redirect, url_for, render_template, flash` to routes.py, make sure you leave the `from flask import Flask` line in the init file.         2.  Move the forms import to routes.py, you'll need to use package names as well, so `from flaksblog` becomes `from flaskblog.models` - `from flaskblog.forms import LoginForm, RegistrationForm`        3.  You'll also need to import the app, as you have lines `app.routes`: `from flaskblog import app`        4.  Import the routes into the init file, make sure the line goes below the app variable to avoid circular importing problems: `from flaskblog import routes`     9.

As Corey notes at 2:57, importing a module doesn't just bring in the names -- it also runs the code in the module.  The routes.py code defines the route functions and registers them with the app (with the help of some decorators).  If we don't import routes somewhere, then that code never gets run.

However I have a question regarding the circular import issue in this video: I was wondering why one can't simply avoid the circularity by neatly separating the app and db variables including their dependencies and creating a clear linear hierarchy.  More precisely: in flaskblog.py I will not import anything from models.py. We don't use the User or Post class in there, nor anything else from models. However User and Post are inheriting from db, which I will simply create right there in the same file, instead of inside flaskblog. Since db is depending from app, I will import app from flaskblog into models, and of course also the SQLAlchemy class, to make this all work. To me, it seems like this is a clean and logical solution, complying to the principle of separation of concerns and creating a neat structure and subsequent order of execution without unnecessary entanglement. It run without problems.  Or is there another reason why we want to create db in flaskblog?",True

Breaking down the structure of the project into a package is a very good idea but your approach with putting import statement at the bottom of the __init__.py file not only breaks pep8 standard but also does not solve the 'ugly import' in flaskblog.py problem that you wanted to avoid by creating a package initially. Have you considered moving the 'from flaskblog import routes' statement into the top of the  run.py file? This seems to solve all of the issues. Cheers!,True

@drudd75077,2019-02-11T23:17:12Z,2,I genuinely don't understand why you would restructure vs just move the import. It seems like I still have to remember a lot to know where things are and it's not a super clean structure as it was to me. I'm a noob in all this so maybe I'll understand the further I go.,True

@ChrisTeater,2019-01-08T20:48:20Z,3,Love your videos...  Having a small problem with this one though.  I have everything setup the way you do and all the code is the same but when I run it I get a message that in the __init__ file it fails on - from flaskblog import routes.  ImportError: cannot import name routes  I go into python and try to import from the command line and it tells me no module named flaskblog (I verified there is no misspelling)  I go back into the __init__.py file and I take out the from flaskblog so it just says import routes and that works.  Do you have any idea why that would be?,True

@smithlo4092,2018-12-21T10:15:12Z,1,"Thanks for the video, Corey. I understand the concept.  I use VS Code and found that Python Extension in VS Code try to follow PEP8 which will automatically move during save the file ""from flaskblog import route"" at the end of __init__.py file to the top part (beginning ) of the file which cause the project error as Corey demonstrate it in this video.  I try to google but I can't find the solution yet. For now, I just disable Python extension in VS Code. If anyone found a solution, which allow me to enable Python extension in VS Code, and it won't automatically move the import line to the top of the file please let me know. Thanks",True

@syedtahaaziz240,2018-12-07T08:27:45Z,0,I think its better if we had the code structure before writing the web app. Because we are not gonna do the refactoring after writing the code.
