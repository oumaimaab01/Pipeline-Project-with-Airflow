@question3v3ryth1ng5,2019-05-07T00:31:37Z,1,"I am confused about one small thing. When you nano into .bash_profile and add ""Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin"" to the beginning of your $PATH, why exactly are you adding that dir? Is that simply where you installed your python 3.7 to? So if I installed my python 3 version to ""usr/bin/python3"" would I simply replace the directory you used in your instance? For example for me would I just PATH=""/usr/bin:${PATH}"" ? Just a little confused as to what directory you are actually putting in front of your $PATH, I guess. I am probably over-complicating it needlessly, but I just really want to make sure I understand this going forward.    Of course I wouldn't actually add the PATH=""/usr/bin:${PATH}"" since that directory is already in my $PATH by default. I am just trying to make sure I am understanding the concept of what adding the directory to the path that you did, will do exactly and why you chose that particular directory. So please let me know if I am thinking of this concept correctly or if I completely missed the mark. Huge thanks for this series, though. I am really learning a lot.",True
