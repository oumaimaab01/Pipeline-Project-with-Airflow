I have to go through agony to switch from being able to run one of the programs and then the other. I‚Äôve even had one version of python basically gut the other version when I installed it even though I put it in a different directory.

I use a simple compiler ""Thonny.""  If I have activated my virtual environment and use Thonny to run the main.py script how do I ensure that it is only using the packages from the virtual environment?  Obviously it can be any other compiler like idle or etc.  I just need to ensure that the compiler is using the virtual environment (local) installation and not the global installation packages and files.  Hope you can help me understand this.  OK APOL.  I think I see it now.  In Thonny there is a command that allows one to log onto a virtual environment. I did this and Thonny indicates that it is using python.exe from the virtual environment folder.  (i.e. C:/Users/myname/Desktop/pythoncourse/day3/venv/Scripts/python.exe.)   I ASSUME NOW that none of the other global packages are being used?  Only local ones?",True

@bilalshah0505,2019-06-16T19:02:20Z,0,Hey corey. One question for the last part when you created a virtual environment which has access to all system installed  packages. I wanted to know if there is a command to install package in virtual environment to install a package from already system installed packages.  Reason could be to install package when you are offline. If we already have a package we should be able to install it in our venv. Thank you.,True
