@AndyGlover,2024-05-17T11:14:24Z,2,"If ""datetime.utcnow"" is giving you an error: The function datetime.utcnow is now deprecated because it returns a ""naive"" datetime object. Instead use datetime.now(timezone.utc) which is ""timezone-aware"". (Note: The SQLite db doesn't natively support timezone-aware datetime objects, but this will still work.)   You can't remove the perens from this like in the tutorial when datetime.utcnow was used. So, including ""lambda:"" before it ensures deferred execution of the datetime.now() function, generating the time at column insertion.  Change your datetime import and date_posted column like so:  from datetime import datetime, timezone date_posted = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False, default=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc))  Thanks for this tutorial!
