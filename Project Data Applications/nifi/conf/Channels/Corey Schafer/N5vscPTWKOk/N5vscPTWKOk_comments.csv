@deepaksingh9318,2020-05-12T18:00:32Z,5,"Hey , Just a quick question Corey. So when we create the Virtual env (like venv in Pycharm) , it does carry all the installed libraries and a python exe version inside it . So is there a way we simply copy the entire folder and paste it in a different machine , without installing that requirements.txt in another another environment.    I researched on this a lot on internet but coudn't find so just wanted to check if you have any solution for it. I also tried the reference paths in VENV files inside it (replaced the paths of old machine with new machine ) , but that didn't work either.  So any solution around it will really be very helpful , because this is the one issue we frequently see while working on project in different environments.",True
