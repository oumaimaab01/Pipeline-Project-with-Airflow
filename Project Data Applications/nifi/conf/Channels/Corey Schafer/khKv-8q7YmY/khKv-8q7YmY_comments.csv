A quick question about the operation you called casting, when converting num_1 and num_2 from strings to integers:  wasn't this more the creation of two new integer objects rather than casting in the traditional sense?  From my (limited) knowledge of other languages, I understood casting to be a temporary operation that forced a change in variable/object type without actually creating new objects.  What happens in your examples seems to create new integer objects, based on the code I've run.",True
