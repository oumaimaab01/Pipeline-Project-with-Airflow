@yuval1588,2022-11-21T10:29:32Z,9,"1. In Python, an object can be called an ""iterable"" if it has the dunder method __iter__ which should return an iterator and an iterator is an object that has the method __next__. 2. __iter__  is a method that a python list has.  3. By performing the for loop on the list, python invokes that list's __iter__ method which returns an iterator that we can loop over.   we can do next(mylist.__iter__()) which invokes the iterator's __next__ method or call  or invoke it directly: mylist.__iter__().__next__()  we can also do next(iter(mylist))  ""Generators are iterators as well, but the duder iter and duner next methods are created automatically.""",True

@pranavnyavanandi9710,2021-11-25T08:49:30Z,0,"Hi Corey. Since class and instance variables in a class prefixed with double underscores are private variables/ attributes - although only conventionally in python - would this not make dunder or magic methods private attributes of a class too? If it does, how then can we access them by their direct name? That is, you wrote: i_nums = list.__iter__() But python performs name mangling of private variables and so __iter__ would have to be _list__iter__. So this way, writing list.__iter__() should raise an attribute error saying list class does not have an attribute '__iter__'. However, this is not the case and the statements executes just fine. Why is this so? Hope to get an answer. Thanks. üôè  P.S. As a side question, classmethod and staticmethod decorators despite being functions are not callable. Why is this? I tried manually making a method a class method by passing it to classmethod decorator; since using the decorator syntax and substituting for it manually does the same thing as you mentioned in your video on decorators. However, it says that classmethod is not callable. ü§î",True

Then what is incremented is self.value, so for the method to work, I understand that 'current' is actually a reference to self.value, and not a hard copy. Thus when incrementing self.value, current is also incremented. If that is so, I wonder if it would be clearer to just increment self.value and then return it already incremented.",True

@MikeLisanke,2019-05-30T21:15:22Z,1,"Corey, Liked your video and thought it was instructive but you left a question on the table. You said that an iterable object can be looped over, and has a dunder __next__ method... but later showed us how to create a generator which uses a yield. You say (as do many) that they like the form of a generator object (rather than the programmer maintaining the stateful mechanism for python) BUT you didn't Say IF the generator object Was considered an iterable object... obviously you showed us looping but does it have a __next__() method? Just a piece of the pie missing which I thought would have added to the story. Thanks again, Mike",True
