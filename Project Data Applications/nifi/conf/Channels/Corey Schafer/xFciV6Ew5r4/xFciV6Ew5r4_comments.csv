@versatil2715,2023-09-19T21:35:35Z,0,"üéØ Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  Sublime Text is a popular text editor for coding, and it can be used for Python development. Sublime Text is available for free, but purchasing a license is encouraged to support the developers. The video demonstrates setting up a Python development environment in Sublime Text. Key packages for Python development in Sublime Text include Package Control for managing extensions, Bracket Highlighter for managing brackets, Sidebar Enhancements for enhancing the sidebar, and Anaconda for Python-specific features like linting and auto-formatting. Customizing settings in Sublime Text, such as themes, color schemes, and font preferences, can enhance the coding experience. Build systems in Sublime Text allow you to run and configure different versions of Python for your projects, and they should be set up according to your needs. Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 build systems can be created by defining their paths in Sublime Text's build system settings. Sublime Text may display pop-ups encouraging users to purchase a license, but it can still be used for an unlimited time without purchasing one. Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 build systems can be set up in Sublime Text to run code with different Python versions. Removing unwanted packages in Sublime Text is possible through the command palette using the ""remove package"" option. The video offers personalized Python development environment setup in Sublime Text, including package installation and build system configuration. The presenter mentions having similar tutorials for Atom, another code editor, which is free and user-friendly, making it a good option for beginners. The choice between Sublime Text and Atom ultimately depends on personal preferences and needs.  Made with HARPA AI",True

However, since you use a Mac and I use a Windows PC there were a few difference not covered. These differences also seem to be hard to find on the official sites. I personally finally found what I was looking for in the comments of your previous Python post.  ""Gurpreet Singh First, install anaconda for python 3.5 and in sublime text, tools, build systems, make new build system and save this to file and make the filename python.sublime-build  {     ""cmd"": [""C:\\Program Files\\Anaconda3\\python.exe"", ""-u"", ""$file""],     ""file_regex"": ""^[ ]File \""(...?)\"", line ([0-9]*)"",     ""selector"": ""source.python"" }  it will definitely work.   Also directory can be different in your system. So to check python directory interpreter open cmd (window) [at the root] c drive level and type ""where python.exe"" (without the quotes).""  Personally I installed Python 2.7 and 3.6 (64). Following the above video I made two files and saved them to my ""C:\Users\SMurphy\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User"" folder  and named them Python27.sublime-build and Python36-64.sublime-build respectively.  All but the path was the same as Gurpreet Singh's example.  {     ""cmd"": [""C:\\Program Files\\Python\\Python36\\python.exe"", ""-u"", ""$file""],     ""file_regex"": ""^[ ]*File \""(...*?)\"", line ([0-9]*)"",     ""quiet"": true }  I hope this give Windows users one more place to chance on an answer, and thank you Cory for your help.",True
