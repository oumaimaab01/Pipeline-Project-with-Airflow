You're gifted in many ways I finally know what is behind a  function return, I can now say I understand closure better, I now know what decorators are used for and how to write and implement one.   I use to have imposter syndrome working with standard library of any programming language, even some written library but now I've been shuffling Python library without any intimidation and I have a good understand on how to import module and above all how Phyton was able to find module or where it look for module.
