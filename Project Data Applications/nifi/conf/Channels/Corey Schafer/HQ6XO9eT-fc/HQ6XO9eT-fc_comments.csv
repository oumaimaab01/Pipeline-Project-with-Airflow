@mariosconstantinou8271,2022-11-28T13:16:31Z,0,"I am a bit confused as to how the drop method knows which rows to remove when we are using a filter. We create a filter and apply it to our df and it returns some boolean values. When we type df.drop(index=df[filt].index) we are basically saying drop the values with the index of our filter? It is working, it removed the rows I wanted but I can't figure out how it's working.  When I printed filt.index it returned a rangeIndex with 6 values (I had 6 rows), some are false and some are true. But when I print df[filt].index it returns the rows 0 and 1 which is the rows that have the value True. So does .index work different depending on where you apply it?  In the case of df[filt].index it will return the index where the value is True?",True
