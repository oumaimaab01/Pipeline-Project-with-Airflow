Basically a good way of using both techniques in such a way that you leverage the strengths of multi-threading within a multi-process operation which I know can be done.   There's just a bit of magic that thread/process pools are doing where they determine how to allocate workers for you and I don't know how to use that magic to divide the list of REST calls optimally per process. I guess I could count the number of CPUs available on the machine but then I kind of like how process pools does that for you and helps make your operations safe without potentially maxing out all processors.",True

@BenderdickCumbersnatch,2019-10-13T11:16:36Z,1,"Just remember that Python is ALWAYS SINGLE-THREADED and that its ""threads"" are fake. They have something called the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) which means that only 1 thread executes at a time.  Two threads cannot execute instructions at the SAME time.  They give the illusion of multithreading by implementing ""let other threads do work while this function waits for data"". It required that the functions are written to be asynchronous, such as time.sleep() or various file I/O functions.  But if you try non-asynchronous calls (things that internally block while waiting for the result) such as ""a = b * c"" or ""a = numpy.zeros([10,10])"", meaning most math operations and C libraries, then the whole ""thread illusion"" in Python falls apart. Each thread will then pause the whole program until each such operation is complete. Which means the ""threaded"" version will take longer to execute than single threaded.  The alternative which gives true multi-CPU execution is the ""multiprocessing"" module which spawns a separate Python process, but it is very slow to start and it transfers data in a slow way (serialized with pickle) between the main process and subprocess.  Python are working on a ""subinterpreter"" module which starts the extra process inside the main process which will be a bit faster but stil requires pickling the data.  In short the situation is bad. And Python will not remove the GIL to fix their threads because it would break all C modules and code that assumed that Python is always single-threaded... sigh.",True

It is actually just fine if you call a computation heavy native library.  The actual reason it slows down is because you’re usually stuck in Python land where all threads share one lock, the GIL (global interpreter lock). This is released when you’re doing sleep, I/O as seen in this video but also applies to other things. So you can only have one thread doing Python at a time, but many others doing system calls or running native code at the same time. If you ever write a python native library, you know the importance of releasing the GIL before entering your native code.",True
