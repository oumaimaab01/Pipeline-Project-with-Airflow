@coreyms,2019-04-09T19:04:50Z,59,"We're covering a lot in this video. We're going to see how to request data from a JSON API, parse out the information we want, sort the data using a custom key, and a lot more. We're going to be using the Homebrew API, but you don't need to use Homebrew or a Mac to follow along. This can apply to many other APIs you'd like to analyze with Python.  As I mention in the video, our final result _does_ have a little more functionality than what we can get from their existing API, so I believe it was definitely a useful exercise. For example, we can filter popular packages by a keyword in the description, which is a nice edition. Hope you all find this helpful!",True

@fatbench,2022-12-03T22:37:57Z,0,22:48 - another option here instead of killing your program with ctrl+c would be to limit the for loop explicitly with an upper bound on the index:  for package in packages_json[:5]:  Sometimes these loops can bog down slower hardware and create lag before the program is killed. Or you can accidentally click outside the terminal and ctrl+c won't kill it until you click back into it. The above method removes all doubt about when the loop will terminate.,True

Simply add [:10] or [:100] or [:1000] to the for loop code.  for package in packages_json:  then becomes for package in packages_json[:100]:  You'll end up with the details of 100 packages in your package_info.json file.",True

@jingyuchang1885,2019-04-18T21:08:51Z,4,No regrets to sponsor your channel at all! Good job Corey!! You videos really helped me a lot!!,True
@gaylonalfano,2019-04-18T01:33:26Z,2,"Amazing as always, Corey! Just curious how you would modify this to break up the request into a few parts, rather than making all requests and then storing the data at the end. Reason I ask is for slower connections if it errors out in the middle of then you lose everything that's been retrieved. My thinking is to use range() to break up the loop into smaller parts and then changing the subsequent writes to our package_info.json file to append new package data (rather than overwriting). Sound sensible? Anything I might be missing? Thanks as always for the amazing content!",True

@frankconte2457,2019-04-11T16:33:52Z,0,"Thanks Corey for another great video. I am following your tutorial using my Jupyter notebook. Unfortunately, the Jupyter Notebook server I am on stops sending out output (which is not to crash homebrew server).  Can we simply download the file and then read it into your script? Please advise.",True

@aniketangwalkar648,2019-04-11T13:04:10Z,0,Dude how much do you even earn by working? or do you just make tutorials?,True
@lardosian,2019-04-11T11:06:02Z,0,"Hey Corey, any plans to do something like creating our own api with Django Rest Framework, would be great to see how you would approach it, just started using it myself to render charts with Chart.js based on the data in the database and it was very quick to get off the ground. Used your django project as the base for my project so thanks a mil for that.   I'm sure I will make some mistakes along the way so would love to see how you do it.",True

I'm sure Homebrew was whacked last night with a bunch of JSON get requests--I know I tried it out--but I made sure to sleep each request between calls like you said.   I am sure there's a lot of outside work that goes into making a great video--planning, writing, rendering, etc.--and I really appreciate the effort you put forth to produce such great content. Thanks so much for taking the time to put this video together.",True

@cylonscion5470,2019-04-10T01:29:25Z,1,"Great video. One suggestion I have is to also say something about error handling in the script. For instance, what if response.get() had thrown an error for some reason (e.g. connection timed out). How should one deal with that in a script like this? How should one go about figuring out how to property specify a try: and except:?",True

@briandreilly,2019-04-09T23:18:12Z,0,"Excellent video!! I would be interested to see how a script like this would store financial information or data that changes periodically. Like timestamping, storing each json file individually, retrieving, and comparing them. Would you use a database to store the info instead of multiple json files? Many thanks.",True

@coreyms,2019-04-09T19:04:50Z,59,"We're covering a lot in this video. We're going to see how to request data from a JSON API, parse out the information we want, sort the data using a custom key, and a lot more. We're going to be using the Homebrew API, but you don't need to use Homebrew or a Mac to follow along. This can apply to many other APIs you'd like to analyze with Python.  As I mention in the video, our final result _does_ have a little more functionality than what we can get from their existing API, so I believe it was definitely a useful exercise. For example, we can filter popular packages by a keyword in the description, which is a nice edition. Hope you all find this helpful!",True
