@r125l6,2024-02-21T11:41:51Z,5,"Dear Corey,  I've been following your YouTube channel for quite some time now, and I must say, your teaching style is exceptional. From mastering Python basics to diving into advanced concepts, Pandas, Matplotlib, Git, and especially Django, your tutorials have been pivotal in my learning journey as a computer science graduate.  Your ability to explain complex topics with clarity is truly remarkable. Now, as I aspire to become a professional Django developer, I believe there's no one better suited to guide us through Django Rest Framework. Your expertise and knack for breaking down concepts would make a tutorial on Django Rest Framework—from basics to production-ready practices—a highly valuable resource for aspiring professionals like myself.  Thank you for all the knowledge and inspiration you've shared so far, and I eagerly anticipate any future tutorials you may create.  Best regards, Rasel Rana Bangladesh",True

I started programming in the “stone age”  in the mid ‘80 ‘s. Using RPGIII and SQL on the IBM S/38 and later AS/400. I have followed your tutorials with very much interest and great joy. I do have a question about the Django course. I have followed and programmed all the steps in the different tutorials. At the very end I decided to migrate from SQlite to MySQL. I have followed all the necessairy steps and to my delight it worked.  I had dumped the data in a datadump.json . Using the “python manage.py loaddata datadump.json” does not work which I understand because of the Id and keys fields links between the auth_user and users_profile tables. However i have encounted one serious problem. The Django standard admin and the registration form in the user app both do not work properly anymore. I get an error wich indicates that i have an force_insert error.  I understand this is, in the case of the registration form, related to the save() statement in the view.py  in the users app. I have tried various solutions (defining in the class a (force-inser() false setting) this seemed  partially to work but than the users_profile record is not created...
