@Dark3nedDragon,2019-03-03T23:44:25Z,0,"This helped a lot actually, thanks.   I started learning Python a few days ago, and decided to create a game (never done coding before). I was having an issue with trying to figure out how to define a variable to a specific line (readline; didn't know that at the time), as a means of tracking the progress and associated flags as the player goes through the game. (An RPG; so far working systems, not all fully integrated: Main Menu, Combat Module, Character Class + Character Power Choosers, and Class for Enemies and scaling stats based on level)   If any of you were wondering how to do that, or needed reinforcement for it:   I created (using another, not shown, while loop + function),  gameSave.txt file, and defined values to put into it (writing it into existence) And for loading I use the below to pull the values from that written file, and save them as variables as it runs  ############# DELETE THE # IF YOU ARE TRYING TO RUN THIS IN A FILE, AND MAKE SURE TO CREATE A FILE CALLED gameSave.txt and put stuff on first 3 lines####### #################DELETE EVERYTHING TO THE RIGHT OF A # THAT IS MY ANNOTATION EXPLAINING IT  global pclevel #define the variables as with the global tag, this helps avoid issues where you can't set a value to a variable while it is within a function (might not be needed in some cases) global pcxp global pcname pclevel = '' #this is empty in the middle, two ' ergo empty variable pcxp = '' pcname = ''   with open('gameSave.txt', 'r') as g: #defined g as the term to open the file, as it is shorter and I'm feeling lazy after awhile     gsave = g #gsave = g, I didn't use gsave here but figured it is best to store the values as it is a small file, would probably not recommend unless you intend to use it later     pclevel = g.readline() #I stored the values in lines 1-3, and so set a value to each based on sequential readline, which is read as g (where we defined open('gameSave.txt', 'r')).readline()     pcxp = g.readline() #gets the second line     pcname = g.readline() #gets the third line   print(pclevel) print(pcxp) print(pcname)   #the above 'open' redefines the variables to the values that are stored within each line of the file, in sequential order, and then printing that variable will print out the stored information #worth noting, if you wanted to do say print('My name is ' + pcname + ' and my level is ' + pclevel) #you would need to do a str(pclevel) for example, to convert the stored number into a string; attempting to print an integer + a str won't work #i.e. print('My name is ' + str(pcname) + ' and my level is ' + str(pclevel)) #never hurts to be safe, the name SHOULD be stored as a str, but idk maybe you're R2D2 or something",True

@lachlanmcleod5294,2016-11-30T00:46:53Z,0,"Hey Corey. Excellent work! Do you have any idea how to perform a calculation to multiple csv files at once and then export these as new csv files to a new folder location renaming them automatically. For instance, lets say you have 100 csv files located in multiple subfolders and they all have Datetime as their first column, is there a way to automatically resample all csv files to hourly data and then export all these files to a new folder and automatically rename them to include ""hour"" in their name? Any advise would be much appreciated. Thanks mate.",True
