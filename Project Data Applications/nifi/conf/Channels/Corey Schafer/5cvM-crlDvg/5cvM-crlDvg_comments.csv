@fxstreamer238,2019-06-01T15:57:45Z,0,repr returns a string of the whole line without executing the code but str returns a string of the result . why would you not show the a and b variables in your example? Thats  literally makes it harder to understand . Also  at 6:27 when you are explaining this simple thing you dont make any sense.,True

@manikdhingra1606,2018-09-14T02:59:14Z,1,"Hello Corey! You do an amazing job at explaining complex things in a straight forward way. I started these videos and got addicted to it. Thanks for sharing.  QQ - You mentioned that repr is for coders and help them in debugging. To that point, what repr is doing can be done with type(). Type(a) will return datetime.datetime  and type(b) will return str. So my question is why to use repr. Do you mind sharing another example to make it more clearer. Thanks!",True
