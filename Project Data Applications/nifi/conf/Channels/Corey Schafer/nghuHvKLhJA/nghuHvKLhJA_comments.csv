You are using some of the best practices of Python. Concise, clean and readable. I've seen so many tutorials prior to finding you and every time I was asking myself..... ""Why would you do that? it looks/feels cumbersome"" but since I just started learning python I was not asking too many questions.   Then I found your tutorials on Beautiful Soup and I was so happy, because I could follow all the things you said and after that I started looking up other tutorials... I am so happy that you keep yourself and others up to date.  Majority of tutorials you will see this syntax:   print(""hello world "" + value + "" this was value"") almost no ppl use format() !!!! and it's only one example.     tl;td  Thank you so much!

@slavoie,2018-07-13T01:00:37Z,68,"One cool use of f-strings can be to iterate over a dictionary where the keys are strings of integers for some reason (using a JSON dictionary for instance) and get the values out of it directly with integers. No need to add an extra step to convert to strings, just use an f-string!  Example: >>> mydict = {'0': 30, '1': 12, '2': 6, '3': 11, '4': 20}  # using strings as keys >>> [mydict[f'{i}'] for i in range(4)]  # list comprehension to retrieve values in dictionary based on integer >>> [30, 12, 6, 11]  # list of values retrieved  Hopefully someone will find that useful... or at least somewhat interesting :).",True
