I've been trying to re-skill my self into other industries of Mechanical Engineering, to learn some more process design stuff and migrate there; I like this Mechanical Engineering thing and I'm not about to give up. But those Mechanical Engineering courses are so incredible expensive, they are not meant for ""outsiders"" like me. Not only those courses are expensive, they are at times shallow and a sales pitch for: ""tell your company to buy this other course where we go into greater detail. By the way, these other courses are on this other city so you can travel on company's dime and get paid to learn.""  It gets really expensive, and the instructor himself said the courses are not enough to break into that industry either way. The courses are meant to line the instructor pockets and pad the attendee resumes on their company.  On the other hand, all the videos and resources I'm finding about coding, computer science and its kin; are not only FREE! they have depth, content and quality that I haven't seen in courses costing thousands of dollars in fancy Hotels.   Corey Schafner, thank you so much for all of these Python courses. I'm beginning to entertain the idea of trying to migrate into coding or data science. I've always coded in ME and I have all the math either way.    But...it's only a pipe dream.

Why does it need to be inherited prior to be used? 2) How come the output is printing out these tags without these functions (handle_starttag, handle_data, etc.) even being called from somewhere? Unless you call these functions, they will not execute, and will not print out anything. In the above example, only the "".feed"" function on the parser object is being called. Please help me understand this.  Thank you, much appreciated!",True

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-12T16:46:39Z,760,"Corey talks about inheritance of classes in this video.   1. What is inheritence? It is a method that allows us to create a new class that shares the same attributes and method with the original function, and add some extra functionality to the new class. It also does not disturb the original class.   2. How to make a class inherit from another class? class Developer(Employee):   3. Structure of classes and subclasses. When we input a function to a subclass, python follows the 'method resolution order', which is the chain of classes that it goes through to find what the method is. All classes have the built-in group of methods and attributes as their primary order.   4. How to initiate the subclass so that it can handle more information than its original class can? There are 2 ways. first, using the super method as follows and pass in the arguments in interest. super.__init__()   Second, call the parent's init method explicitly and pass in the arguments in interest. Employee.init(self, first, last, )   5. Useful tools when exploring the inheritance system. .isinstance(instance, class) This method returns the boolean value of whether an instance belongs to a calss .issubclass(subclass, class) This method returns the boolean value of whether a class has inherited from the second class.   6. Example of class inheritance Whisky library   ++ when setting a default value for an ungiven argument, avoid using an empty mutable data type. That's a topic for another video.",True

Maybe someone can help me: Why would I use instances of classes as data structure for such a purpose like Corey is doing in these examples? I have tried this for a similar project but found that it is hard to handle the data after the instances have been constructed. For example, how could Corey iterate over all developers or print out all the managers that earn more than a certain amount? I really ran into problems with that in my project and switched over to dictionaries afterward having to chance all the code in the end. Are there convenient functions to do stuff like that in class-instances?",True

@Tw1que,2016-11-20T15:50:00Z,0,"Hi Corey, I love the tutorials. The only thing that is confusing me is the follwing; the way I see it now is you would have to write a list of employees inside of your program? Or is there a way to have a class that adds new employees and store the objects somewhere else... Or am I missing something?",True

This (video) is nothing new to me, but sometimes I go back and watch tuts just for a refresher or to see if I like the teacher. You make it easy to grasp, and in an exciting way.  I hope you continue making tutorials, Corey, cause you're so damn good at it. Thanx again.",True

@D3bilChild,2016-09-13T15:13:52Z,0,"Hi Corey! Loving your tutorials, have been recommending them to all the people interested in Python! Keep up the good work!  I have a question for which I couldn't find an answer. I am having trouble building my code when trying to use super in my child class. If i go with Employee.__init__(self, first, last, pay) it works. When I use super i get an error saying 'super takes at least 1 argument 0 given'. I am using python 2.7 and i found a SO post saying that super needs arguments passed in python 2.7, i.e super(Developer, self).__init__(first, last, pay) but it's not working.  Any thoughts on this? Thanks",True
@umanagaswamy1180,2016-09-04T12:34:09Z,2,"Corey, this is one of the best tutorials I have seen on inheritance! Thanks so much for a concise explanation. I have been developing OOP for a few years now and I learned a ton of stuff watching your videos.  For using super in python 2.7, I had to modify the code a little bit as follows:   class Employee(object):     ... class Manager(Employee):     raise_amount = 1.10      def __init__(self, first, last, pay, employees=None):          super(self.__class__, self).__init__(first, last, pay) # <----- this line in particular         if employees is None:             self.employees = []         else:             self.employees = employees  I didn't realize that we cannot use Markdown in youtube comments!",True
