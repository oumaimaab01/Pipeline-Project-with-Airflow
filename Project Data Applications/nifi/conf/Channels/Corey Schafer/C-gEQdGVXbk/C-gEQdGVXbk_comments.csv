@cprn.,2021-04-10T16:17:22Z,0,"These are all fine notes but I hoped for some tips on code organisation and you only briefly mentioned running modules with `-m` in CLI. Take it up a notch, e.g. separate strategies module from creatures module and I'm lost. Imagine files structure like `/mygame/strategies/speak/{meow,quack,talk}.py` alongside of  `/mygame/creatures/{cat,duck,person}.py`. How do you introduce sensible composition? How do you make the duck quack? If I add `from mygame.strategies.speak.quack import Quack` in `animals/duck.py` I can't re-use animals + strategies in a package with a different name because this is literally a named package import. But if I replace this with a relative import I get ""attempted relative import beyond top level package"" when e.g. testing. Python is unintuitive mess whenever I try to do anything slightly more complicated than following tutorials.",True

@santoshpss,2021-03-22T05:26:07Z,0,"Important Fact:  Standing Bodies Of Water are *always* level (level means no elevation or deviation from the starting point to the end). This is a scientific fact because this is observable, testable, repeatable, measurable, demonstrable by every single human being alive. This fact alone destroys the mathematical concept and religious idea known as the ""heliocentric model"". More specifically, this fact alone makes it impossible for us to live on an exterior of a pear-shaped sphere spinning at fantastical speeds going nowhere.  Just before you start to attach straw man fallacies on to me, keep in mind these important things:  There are three different sciences: Natural Science (which deals with the Objective World)  Social Science (deals with societies and the relationship between people in societies)  Formal Science (deals with languages such as mathematics which bares no connection to the Objective World)  ""What is the shape of the earth I stand upon?"" this is a Natural Science question.  Science does not belong to an institution or a group of people. It belongs to every single human being alive.  We live in the present. Not in the past or the future. History can never be considered as a fact of reality in any way shape or form because of obvious reasons. We can't directly experience the past or the future.  Just observing something is not a fact that something exists. We need observable, testable, repeatable, measurable, demonstrable practical proofs for something to be considered as a fact. This is also known as the Scientific Method.  There is a difference between the corporeal world (the physical world) and the visible world. The reason why we can't conclude something as a fact based on our observations is because we know things get smaller based on how far they're from us when we see them through our eyes. If I see a railroad, the lines look like they're converging, but we know that's impossible because people measured the lines, and the lines are parallel. The lines don't actually meet in real life, it's just how we see things. Our eyes are spherical, we see euclidean (planar) world through spherical eyes.  Without physically testing, repeating, measuring, and accessing something in full three dimensions, it's impossible to know exactly what it is that we're trying to quantify.  Looking up at the sky does not give you measurable proof of the earth you stand upon. It's like looking up at the light in your room and then measuring the floor based on that light. It's absurd.  Images and videos are never considered as scientific proofs because of obvious reasons. Images and videos can be manipulated, they're not tangible. We can't directly experience them.  Mathematical equations bare no relation to the Objective World. Mathematics is just a language, like English. Just because something is mathematically correct does not make it real. It's like saying ""I'm flying!"", even though the sentence is grammatically correct, I'm obviously not flying right now.  ""Gravity"" is a mathematical concept, it's pseudoscience. It does not have any practical proofs. Magical pulling forces don't exist in the Objective Reality. Motion only happens if something presses on something else (pressure variants). Pull is just a term for taking something closer to someone.  Things falling down has got nothing to do with the shape of the earth. In the simplest sense things that weigh more than air fall, and things that weigh less than air float. Why do things even fall? No one has any practical proof for why things even have weight. The mathematical theorists are making assumptions about why things are falling, but understand that those are just assumptions, not facts.  The sky, the Moon, the Sun, and the Stars are all intangibles. If every single human being can't observe, test, repeat, measure, demonstrate something in a practical fashion, it is considered a belief, or pseudoscience. Does every single human being has access to these lights in the sky? Obviously not. Not to mention stars look like flashing lights when looked through a Nikon COOLPIX P900 (It's still not a proof of anything because we can't move around them in full three dimensions).  Admitting to yourself that you truly don't know something is the most honest realization you could have, it is how you progress further. For example, I do not know what the Sun is. The mathematical theorists are making assumptions of what the Sun is, and where it is located. They don't know what the Sun actually is, or where it is located. Unless I could move around the Sun in full three dimensions, the only possible stance I can have is ""I don't know"". Anything beyond that will be a belief. For example, if I say ""The Sun is a cylinder-shaped object moving in the sky"", it is just a belief because I can't move around the Sun in full three dimensions to know if it's a cylinder or a circle. The only thing I know is that it's a light in the sky moving in a straight line across the sky (because of how our eyes work it looks like the Sun is moving in an arc across the sky, but the Sun is actually moving across the sky in a straight line).  Another example, ""I know the full dimensions of earth"" is also a belief because I never explored the whole world to know the full dimensions. Remember, something only becomes a fact if it's observable, testable, repeatable, measurable, demonstrable by every single human being alive. In this case, each and every individual should explore the Objective World to its fullest extent, listening to ""authorities"" is just a belief. The world ""map"" is also a concept, because every single human being didn't explored the whole world to verify or falsify the map. People are believing in whatever the ""governments"" say or show. People are literally believing in complete strangers and thinking the official ""world map"" is true and there is nothing more to explore because they see a blue sphere on their TV.  Just because the majority of the population are believing something exists doesn't mean something actually exists in the Objective World. Once again, we need OTRMDPPs for something to be considered a fact of the Objective Reality.  Letters before your name does not mean anything. Direct experience is the most important thing. If we can't experience something directly then most of the time it's useless for us.  I can only represent myself. Personalities are OUT of the question.  If I drop a brick on my head I know what's going to happen. The objective reality does not change based on your subjective opinions or beliefs. It is what it is.  Why is this important? Well, the government and its associations are BLATANTLY lying about our existence, the shape of the world, and the dimensions of the world. What's more important than finding out how far the world extends? Full exploration is needed for further understanding of life's most important questions: where we are, why we're here, and what's it all about. Without knowing where we are everything we do is just a concept.  For example, if I give you a board, and without giving you any instructions or rules, I want you to play a game, what game are you going to play? The government and its associations are telling you what you're suppose to do, what's expected of you, what you're not suppose to do. Who agreed to their ""law"" book? I certainly did not. How is it fair that the government and its associations (the police and the military) are imposing their subjective rules onto the human beings? Everyone has different rules about different things, subjective rules are personal, they're NOT objective. These governments, police, military are imposing their SUBJECTIVE rules onto others, this is nothing short of tyranny.  Why can't we freely explore the objective world as much as we like? Why is there a physical, and mental restriction by the police, the military, and by psychopaths known as the governments?  Remember, no one rules if no one obeys.  ""People are arguing and fighting over what game to play when they don't even know the board they're playing on"" -Del (Beyond the imaginary curve youtube channel: https://youtube.com/channel/UCvswlgeHodOejVN21TWweLw) (People are arguing about what to do without knowing the full dimensions of the world)  Another analogy: if I erase your memory and put you in a confinement, what is the first thing you're going to look for? Where's the exit. But if I put some actors to distract you by showing you books and telling you there is no exit, then you'll never try to even think about the exit, there will be other brainwashed people just like you who'll brainwash you even more. Then some other actors will tell you what to do, what's expected of you, what you're not suppose to do, and what's the punishment for breaking their god-given ""law"" book, some other brainwashed people will also have weapons so that common people like you will forcefully follow my law book, which makes my job incredibly easy by making you a slave if that's what I was ever up to.  Why should we accept slavery? Why should we accept strangers imposing their subjective versions of what's good and what's bad onto us?  If you have OTRMDPPs (Observable, Testable, Repeatable, Measurable, Demonstrable Practical Proofs) that large Standing Bodies Of Water can bend, (sounds absurd to even think about it) please feel free to email me at MysteriousPlane@pm.me, but understand that I should be able to demonstrate your claims in a practical fashion, because that's how the Objective World works. No offense, but If your claims does not have any practical proofs, then I'm afraid I have to conclude that you're either blatantly lying or you're really stupid (Or for some reason you want to defend your religious beliefs, because the Earth being a sphere is a religious belief, a mathematical concept, it has no practical proofs, it has no relation to the Objective World, that being real life).",True

@NyscanRohid,2020-06-08T14:24:36Z,0,"For the `zip` example, just use an index. There's nothing wrong with it, it's not unintuitive, and it's one less useless filtering function you have to memorize. I get it that python wants to be clean and efficient, but it just seems like bells and whistles at this point. The whole point of having parallel arrays is so that you can index through them in parallel, which means they already have convenience built in to their design; you don't need to add more convoluted convenience. Suppose I'm your client who isn't as savvy with python, and I need to read your code to see what it does, and it tells me to go look up `zip`, because you need it to do something as stupidly simple as indexing through two arrays in parallel. It's not helpful, it's annoying.",True
@Acecool,2020-06-08T09:07:44Z,0,"Good call on the underscores - I wasn't aware of that. What I typically do is align the = on my code, then for numbers I just add spaces to the beginning so the numbers line up where they should be. The unpacking with *_ is useful too, can be used for shifting during recursion, and other things. I usually just pass through to the function though by having 2 unpacked args and then having a varargs or keyed varargs arg after to contain the rest.  Instead of setattr and getattr ( you forgot to add in a default - I would always recommend setting it to nil in the code if you aren't going to use it so someone looking at it will know that something can go there - even though it is optional, having it defined as nil lets someone who isn't as familiar use it... you could even set it as a non-existant variable name and call it default ).  there is another thing called properties. This lets you set up these accessors quickly and easily. I prefer function names, so I set up an accessor helper object which creates both. so I can do 1 line of code in an object such as class BaseBlah: pass, class Base( BaseBlah ): __x = Accessor( BaseBlah, 'x', 'X', TYPE_FLOAT, default = 0.0 ) and y, and z.. and create blah.GetX( ), blah.SetX( 'test' ) which is ignored because it isn't a number, blah.x = 123.00 which goes through the setter property.. The one problem is I have to create an empty base so that I can define it within the object, but it ends up looking decently clean except that empty class base, and I can set up a lot of advanced restrictions for the accessors such as restricting a data-type to one or many, a value to one or many, defining has helpers, adders, tostring functions, and more.  I use __x which links to the accessor object so changes can be made. _x is the raw data. .x goes through the property. So I can set a default value and _x can be nil, but .x will return 0.0.  Accessors are helpful.",True

If you have a function that takes e.g. 2 inputs as integers (x, y) and you get the x, y values in Tuples (x, y) or lists, it wont take it as arguement since input x would correspond to the Tuple (x, y). You could use the asterix *(x, y) to unpack it and pass the Tuple into the function.",True

@randmorf,2020-05-03T17:44:31Z,0,"What about using ""_"" (underscores) for very small numbers?  When I tried it, Python 3.7 seemed to accept the underscores, but when I printed the number it was printed using scientific notation. When I print the large numbers, they are printed using all the zeros (w/o underscores), but without scientific notation. Seems inconsistent to me. They should work the same way... either both displayed with scientific notation, or both written out  with all the 0's (zeros). Also, the formatted print string trick using "":,"" also works with big numbers, but not small numbers. Maybe I'm missing some secret like "":,"" that will allow me to print very small numbers with all the zeros. Any ideas?  [ I guess the other solution is to choose more appropriate units of measure; no one measures sub-atomic particles in parsecs, nor interstellar distances in angstroms. ]  Here's my code:  <code>  # Working with large numbers in Python v.3.7.  In the real world, we separate large numbers # into groups of 3-digits using comas(',') to make the large numbers easier to read, easier to # work with, and to avoid making mistakes. In Python 3.7 you can do the same thing using  # the underscore character (""_"") without affecting the value of the number:  bignum1 = 10000000000000  # Quick! How many ""0""s is that? bignum2 = 10_000_000_000_000  print(f""\n{bignum2}\n should equal\n{bignum1}\n"") # Use formatted print ':,"" to show comas (',') # in place of underscores ('_'): print(f""\n{bignum2:,}\n should equal\n{bignum1}\n"")  # Using the ternary operator... # same = True if bignum2 == bignum1 else False # print(same) # print(True if bignum2 == bignum1 else False) print(bignum2 == bignum1)  # Easier than ternary operator  # Which begs the question... # Can it work with very small numbers?  smallnum1 = .00000054321 smallnum2 = .000_000_543_21  print(f""\n{smallnum2}\n should equal\n{smallnum1}\n"") print(f""\n{smallnum2:,}\n should equal\n{smallnum1:,}\n"")  # Using the ternary operator... # same = True if smallnum2 == smallnum1 else False # print(same) # print(True if smallnum2 == smallnum1 else False) print(smallnum2 == smallnum1)  # Easier than ternary operator  # Well, Python 3.7 seems to accept underscores with very small numbers, but these  # small numbers are printed using scientific notation (e.g. 0.00000054321 is  # displayed as  5.4321e-07).

@datboi_gee,2020-01-13T03:59:13Z,1,"Quick question.  Still super new to Python.  I haven't been in the dev game for roughly 10 years and Python is my first and only experience with an interpretive language.  All prior experience was within the Visual Studio .NET framework, specifically with the languages VB & C#.  Firstly, I absolutely LOVE Python.  Like too much.  It feels like how programming was always meant to be.  Anyway:  though I have significant experience in other languages, this is my first time taking the self-taught approach to learning a new language.  Besides that, its been nearly a decade since I did any legitimate writing.  So I'm coming at this from a fresh perspective.  I can see these techniques being useful.  Even when you were explaining advanced unpacking techniques, I can still see the utility.  I adore the utility of the zip function and the enumerate function.  I love the ability to set and get attributes on the fly.  And though not all techniques are useful at all times, that's just the way programming is.  Some use cases are much more narrow than others.  My question is this:  is there a specific resource online somewhere that has quick categorized access to all of these niche functions hidden within Python?  I'm still not quite familiar with modern programming community tools like GitHub or Stack Overflow or Jupyter, etc.  And I'm still not entirely grounded in Python enough to know what libraries are critical, what libraries are superior, what is and what isn't within the core Python library, the utility of Anaconda or Iron Python, etc.  Still soaking up new information.  As it stands I have no problem writing quick effective scripts in Python but when it comes to pre-built, pre-packaged utility, I don't know where to look and why.  So if anyone has pointers for specific tools and use cases for them, I'd very much appreciate it.  Phenomenal video, btw.  Much love.",True
