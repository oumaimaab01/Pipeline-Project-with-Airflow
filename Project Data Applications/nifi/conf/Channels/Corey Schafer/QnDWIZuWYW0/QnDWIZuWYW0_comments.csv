We generally use different logic to look at things, in this tutorial you are inserting the layout.html in to the block content inside home.html. I can understand this, but I struggle with this logic, for me it's easier to conquer the concept if home.html is inserted inside the layout.html block content. In the dynamic web page we are observing changes inside ""static"" layout .html on different urls :). For me this is important to know, because personal logic foundations are on deeper level than programmer logic so there can rise a conflict. I think that overlooking this  is a problem long way in learning process, this is just one case, sometimes is better to take opposite view to better understand the concepts :) Thank you!",True

@kaanaslan_tr,2021-07-18T12:54:45Z,1,"Hello and thank you for these great tutorials. The only part I found very difficult to understand was the part after you decided to add navbar and the rest. Because all the ready snippets that you have and copying and pasting them didn't teach me how to do it on a new website. I would also like to understand the logic. So far the first 2 videos are awesome but in order to continue for the rest of the course, I need to understand how you decide to make those navbar and make separate posts that look better. Is there another tutorial that will help me understand those parts better? I'd really like to stop here and improve that knowledge and continue. Thanks.",True

After incorporating bootstrap and the other html and css files from your snippet, my webpage looks nothing like what yours looks like. The Blog post headings overlap with the navigation bar, whose content is white in color and essentially invisible. Any idea what could be the problem?  EDIT: I've figured out that this has to do with the bootstrap version I'm currently using. At the time of this tutorial it was version 4.0, now it's 4.5. Switching to 4.0, it rendered the nav bar and the rest of the content just fine. So I'll need to look up what changed between the 2 versions to cause this. If you have any idea, please let me know. I'll keep researching this",True

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-25T16:19:31Z,0,"Summary: It is complex to view all the html codes in our original python code itself, and this gives rise to the need for importing render_template class from the flask library. We can pass in variables to the html files using {{}}. We have to pass in a second argument in render_template function, as 'name to be used in html = variable in our python file'. In the html file, we can pass in the variable by inserting name in the double curly braes. Values generated from our dictionary will be accessed through '.key' format. We can also make codes using {%%}. Unlike our loops and conditionals in python, html codes has to be ended manually by using statements such as {% endif %} or {% endfor %}. This system is somehow similar to the C++ language.   We can make one html file inherit from another html file that is in the same directory. The parent file has a block code inside in the format of {% block name %} {% endblock %}. Putting {% extend ""layout.html"" %} in the first line of the child file is a declaration that we will extend from that parent html file. Simply putting the lines of code that we want between {% block name %} and {% endblock name %} will extend that particular block from the parent html file.   This way of inheriting html file from another is the best practices, because it lets our code stay 'DRY'(don't repeat your self). It makes us easier to debug, lessens time to code, and makes it easier to update our website. Therefore, Corey adds bootstrap operation and some other functions in the layout.html, which is the parent file. We add in the navigation bar, blah, blah, and so on.(I didn't really understand the last 6 minutes, because I was unfamiliar with concepts such as css, meta-data, and etc.)",True

You did an awesome job explaining everything up until that point, and then you started copying and pasting large quantities of stuff with little explanation. You mentioned using bootstrap, and you said you were pasting in stuff with bootstrap styles, but you didn't really explain it. Even if you said RTFM it would have been helpful to know where it could be found in the docs for more detail.

One comment I have is if you load the external jquery script in the parent template ""layout.html""  after the block content section where each child template will run, jquery will not work in a child template if you try to use it in javascript. Bootstrap will work in this case because it acts after the page loads, but jquery must be loaded before you try to use it in a script of your own. I sovled this by putting my jquery load in the head of layout.html. However, I've looked around and putting the jquery load where you put it seems standard...

Even though i'm running the latest version of debian, stretch, the version of python was 3.5x (as of December, 2018).  The secrets module was introduced in python 3.6.  I built the latest version of python, 3.71 on the pi and then found all kinds of problems.  Python couldn't find flask and other problems.  The solution turned out to be simple.  As you recommended, and others, I created a virtual python environment and all started working as expected.  I was reluctant to add the extra overhead on the pi, but it solved the problem and the pi is working just fine.  I really don't notice the extra overhead at all. Just for the record, I am using a Raspberry 3b+ and a 64gig sd card. Once again, thank you for this excellent series.",True
