@5037digg,2016-08-29T21:59:13Z,34,"Best Python tutorials I've found. Your coverage of subject matter is clear and professionally presented. I've learned, and retained, more from your videos than all the others I've watched. They have sufficient depth to actually be useful (rather than the typical YouTube video fly-by) but not so much as to overwhelm and confuse. The step-by-step illustrations are perfect and a great way to teach. Your method of presentation is clear, direct and clearly well-planned in advance; no stumbling around, nice use of pre-entered code ready to slide in when appropriate, no waste of time, no trying to figure out the subject matter on the fly, no cluttering things up by presenting unneeded details, no attempt to show off. Your extra effort shows!   I've subscribed and will advise my colleagues to give a look. I'd like to see a lot more Python tutorials, including exploration of some of the more popular or useful package libraries.",True
