@coreyms,2020-05-29T16:16:21Z,112,"Hey everyone. This video will be the first video of several where we explore the YouTube API and see how to do some data analysis on public YouTube data. We will learn some useful things we can do with this API. In the next video, I'll show how we can use this API to calculate the total duration of a YouTube playlist, which is information that Google doesn't already have listed for playlists. Also, I'm still working on completing the script I'll use to grab my YouTube channel members, so the end credits for the videos still only contains Patreon supporters at the moment. But I hope to have this resolved shortly. Hope everyone had a great week!",True

@coreyms,2020-05-29T16:16:21Z,112,"Hey everyone. This video will be the first video of several where we explore the YouTube API and see how to do some data analysis on public YouTube data. We will learn some useful things we can do with this API. In the next video, I'll show how we can use this API to calculate the total duration of a YouTube playlist, which is information that Google doesn't already have listed for playlists. Also, I'm still working on completing the script I'll use to grab my YouTube channel members, so the end credits for the videos still only contains Patreon supporters at the moment. But I hope to have this resolved shortly. Hope everyone had a great week!",True
