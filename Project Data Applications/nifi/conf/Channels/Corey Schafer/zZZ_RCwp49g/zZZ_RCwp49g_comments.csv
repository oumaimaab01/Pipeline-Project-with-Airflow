@timstark6744,2019-06-17T11:05:10Z,0,"Thanks Corey, great videos!  Looking forward to rest of the series!  I'm trying to do something like Hans Rosling's video with plotting some data points over a 10 or 20 year period to perform analysis and to better visualize my data.  I see a library called plotly_express but for now I'm just going to use a more organic approach with matplotlib.     Question I have is are you planning on showing how to integrate control of the event attributes to make the data more interactive?   I'm thinking of taking a scatter plot and then popping up attribute information when the cursor is over a data point (assume we use axes_enter/leave_event or figure_enter/leave_event)??  Pardon me if you already covered this as I just started watching yesterday and am kind catching up still.   Other graph type I'm interested in is the bar_polar to display several key metrics for a company or project, to better visualize overall performance at a glance.     I really think data analytics and data visualization is hot right now, and appreciate your timing with this video series.  It would be great to see this series as a foundational component and then another intermediate or more advanced series to address a variety of use cases and how we could leverage these skills we are learning here, and tweak them slightly to create even greater visualizations or interactive data analysis tools.",True
