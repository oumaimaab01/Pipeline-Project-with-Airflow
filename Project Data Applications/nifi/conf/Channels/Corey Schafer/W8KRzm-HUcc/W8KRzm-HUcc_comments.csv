@markkennedy9767,2023-02-11T00:57:48Z,1,"At 10:00 where you showed that the .pop method actually returns something (the item you removed), this is another example of what seem to me the idiosyncrasies that arise in Python. What I mean is that even though we are dealing with a mutable object (a list), courses.pop returns something and courses itself is changed as it is a list (a mutable object). Compare this with courses.remove which returns nothing and again courses is changed as it is a list (object).    Compare this again with methods acting on a string e.g. courses , an immutable object where now, say courses.replace would return a value and courses would not be modified. There's no real consistency: I would have thought mutability/immutability correlated with a method not returning/returning a value. Until .pop messes this up by being halfway between the two: It both modifies in place (mutability) AND returns a value for courses.pop. Python is definitely more elegant than most languages but it seems at times like it's thrown together. Admittedly I am a relative beginner, so I may be missing a deeper meaning to the apparent inconsistency above.",True

@thecowmilk4857,2022-04-13T09:02:26Z,1,"@CoreySchafer, I know that this is too late to write but you forgot to explain to beginners how to access list inside a list indexes.  To access the indexes of a list inside a list we can use 'double square brackets ""[ ][ ]"" ' to the first list. Writing: courses  = ['History', 'Math', 'Physics', 'CompSci'] courses2 = ['Art', 'Education']  courses.insert(0, courses2) print(courses[0][0])  This will print the index 0(which in original list is another list) and the index 0 of the list inside which is 'Art'  Note: the second square bracket always refers to the second list(if there is any in the specified index in the first square bracket), if the specified index is not a list but a word then it will access the first letter on that word. Second example:  courses  = ['History', 'Math', 'Physics', 'CompSci'] courses2 = ['Art', 'Education']  courses.append(courses2) print(courses[0][0])  Will print out 'H' because: the 0 index is the word ""History"" and this word is spliced into: ['H', 'i', 's', 't', 'o', 'r', 'y']",True

Another note: with pop() method I can use index numbers for the items. If there are 4 items I can use pop(1), pop(2), all the way to pop(3) because the index starts with zero.

In this video though, using a similar method --> courses.sort() altered the original courses list instead.. Is it because the first example was a string / variable, but the second one, a list?
