@Decco6306,2021-01-07T22:41:38Z,0,"macs are a waste of money an are an abuse peoples lack of knowledge about computers to make money and never tell them anything about them so more and more and more people as the generations go by know less and less and less about the tech around them. So little in fact that any multi trillion dollar tech giant can do what ever they want to the consumer and manipulate them think they way they want you to think. People should stop buying apple products for the sake of humanities future. We live in a tech centered society and the simpler you make tech the more capabilities you have to remove and if you remove capabilities it had to begin with its no longer a computer and if no one knows about tech, what kind of dystopian future is that? STOP buying them before its too late. (or is it already too late)",True

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-17T11:23:17Z,3,"summary: Corey explains how to navigate through the file system in this video.   1. ls this lists the files and folders in the working directory. With an '-a', it shows the hidden files, and with an '-l', it also shows additional infromation in the long form. Using with '-la' at the end shows all files including the hidden ones, in the long form. 2. pwd This commmand prints out the working directory 3. cd An acronym for 'change directory'. You have to type the directory of the file that you want to make it as the working directory, after this. Using an '~' will navigate you to the home directory, and '..' to the parent directory.",True
