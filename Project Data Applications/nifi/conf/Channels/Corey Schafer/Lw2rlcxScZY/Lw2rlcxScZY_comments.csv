Could you make a video or just reply here how do you approach learning new language/skill   What are your steps when you see infinite number of methods in some libraries/docs and how do you define witch functions/methods are valuable and witch are not?   Basically I'm asking for a broad description of your approach to learning new skill/language/libraries.     I've seen your video on 'job interview recommendations' and I really loved the things you shared there... specifically I really loved your approach to code on paper...I shared the same approach before the video and just after hearing you saying it out loud immediately made me think that you might have some great tips on the subject of learning.   sincerely yours, inari",True
@thekitten117,2020-01-19T23:18:39Z,1,"Great vids. You are extremely good at simplifying the topic. I am a noob coming to python from SAS.  I would like to see a vid on why python allows you create a field using # df['new'] = df['old1'] + df['old2'] #   but does not let you use a function to create a new field in the same way # df['mydate'] = datetime(df['year'], df['month'], df['day']) #  After some searching I found how to do it with an anonymous function.  If you do a section on creating new fields from others, please cover this task.",True
