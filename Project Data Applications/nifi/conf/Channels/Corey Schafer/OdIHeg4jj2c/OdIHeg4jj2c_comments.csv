I have to make an executable but I get this message at the very end ""Error named module _bootlocale "".  I'm working with code someone else wrote.  I'm using Python 13.0.2 32 bit on Windows 10 64 bit.

Becoz In Widows 7 SP1, By installing Python  automatically set the PATH to the environment variable and it also enables PIP with it since the Sripts folder includes in the PATH. No need to set another Scripts PATH for PIP..................sorry I was wrong. when I type pip in cmd It worked before now it says command not found. and It doesnt allow me to set scripts path below the executable path. If i add new Scripts path it replacing the original path. How to do it Windows & please?",True

@CentboyMidnight,2018-07-27T16:22:12Z,0,"Hey Corey thanks for the video, I asked about this problem and at the next day I got this video. I don't know if it is a coincidence but thanks anyway.  Regrettably I couldn't solve my problem but I discovered why. I will share what I know.  For those one trying to use python3 in the VFX industry, 3D modeling, texturing or rendering (Adobe products included). If you are trying to manipulate via scripting your pipeline you have to know VFX industry doesn't support python3 due to incompatibilities between different software packages, python 2.7 is the standar of the industry instead, and it will be until 2020 (read more at: https://www.vfxplatform.com/ ). It isn't a instalation or path problem, after 2020 you will have to rewrite most of your scripts because they will not work anymore. Currently if you try to write the python3 syntax in the internal editor of those programs you will get an invalid syntax error.",True

@juliancardona3508,2018-07-26T19:09:02Z,6,By far one of the most useful videos on YouTube! Awesome! I pip installed flask but also installed python using anaconda which I guess is messing up flask modules along with peewee modules. Hopefully this helps me modify how my machine looks for peewee and flask libraries.,True
