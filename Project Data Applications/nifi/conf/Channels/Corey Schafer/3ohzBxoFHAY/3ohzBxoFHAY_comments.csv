@bentranch1895,2022-10-21T16:27:41Z,2,"Quick question.  Is it acceptable to include the __repr__ special method for subclasses?  If so, is it best practice to not include child instances, such as the Employees list that are related to an instance of a Manager in the __repr__ result?  The __repr__ method can be made to return the list of Employees related to a Manager, but the resulting string cannot be used to create an instance of a Manager that includes the related employees.  For example, using this __repr__ string result to create a new mgr_2 instance gets an invalid syntax error:  mgr_2 = Manager('Sue', 'Smith', 90000, '[Developer('Dev1', 'Dev1_last', 40000, 'Pthon'), Employee('Earl', 'Newcomer', 50000), Employee('Steve', 'Smith', 30000)]')  - not valid to create a manager.",True

@marianemashkalo4182,2017-10-30T14:24:59Z,0,"Hey! Could anyone if not Corey kindly check this for me, please?  The len method in my class is:  def __len__(self):   return 'The length of name {0} is {1}.'.format(self.name, len(self.name))  #prog 3 is a class instance: prog3 = Programmer('Michelka', 'K', 5 , 100)  To sum up, here are 2 otions I tried out: 1. print (prog3.__len__()) # works this way! 2. print (len(prog3))  # does not work ,gives error:  The error is: Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""python"", line 134, in <module> TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer  __len__ does not return non-negative integer - is a warning inside my code document it is present whether I print option 1. or option 2.   Though these... ( str(prog3) repr(prog3) ) ...work fine having the same type of syntax.  I noticed that Corey checked this method on his fullname, which is itself a method inside a class. While my check is just counting the length of name attribute within the class instance. And surely can be simpy done this way: len(prog3.name) Can it be that  my (print (len(prog3))) does not go to class instance understanding what it is and uses len as a general known function known to Python? And since len(fullname()) within Corey's instance description sends the interpreter to the class right away. Not sure if the theory is vaguely close to the cause of the error or I should not build theories but simply need more knowledge.. Thank you.",True

@jean-paulwilson8534,2017-09-19T15:51:02Z,0,"Hi Corey,   Using the examples you gave (__add__) and (__len__), what would be a real use case for them? 't think of any. The ones you gave, they open up the possibility of many 'add' methods adding different things, and the same with length, so then you would just build your own methods that add things and determine the lengths.   I have not been able to thing of actual reasons to use these dunder methods, and I have looked (and asked) on stack overflow.  Thank-you",True
