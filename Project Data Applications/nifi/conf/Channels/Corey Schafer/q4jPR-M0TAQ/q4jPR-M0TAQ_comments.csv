@panagiotisgoulas8539,2020-10-30T09:37:45Z,1,"If anyone could reply/Help much appreciated, very confused for hours in the order the view communicates with the html around 24:00. General understanding: I got  a register view which wait for a request from user to be able to go in the if-else block of register view. I also know that it returns an http response rendering it to users/register.html. We also passed the context dictionary {'form':form} and by doing so it will pass our form data on our template and let us access it there within the template. Ok. Now the user has to to make the request. So he makes a request, where? in the users/register.html. Question: All right, now the problem understanding starts. If my thought process is mistaken please thoroughly explain!:  1)In users/register.html I inherit from a base class, and that base class has also html related to messages. So, on the inherited part of my users/register.html at some point I find the { if messages } command. That would mean that my html would check for messages every view of users app that renders me to users/register.html, because the html code is written on users/register.html. At the moment cannot find a thing, because messages.success command is ignored because we still don't know what type of request (post or get?) user did (meaning I have no access to if-else block of register view)... 2)Then the { block content } is checked and eventually the {{form}} variable (key) is used. That variable belongs to a <form method='POST'> tag, which means my {{form}} is of post type.  -->>??3)So finally I go back to my view and can access if conditions. My first if condition is validated, I run the messages.success command and I return a redirect to blog/home without checking the part of html code related to messages... What the hell??  Pretty please someone explain thoroughly what wrong with my thought process .",True

@jschvach,2020-07-25T11:17:23Z,0,"Quick question. So I initially worked through a Udemy course with Django (overall good course, but honestly REALLY enjoying these much more. Speaking as an educator myself, your teaching style is phenomenal in these). One thing they mentioned was that Class-based views are now the preferred method as opposed to the function based views, but didn't really go into how the FBV and CBV are related. I think the function based views help in understanding what is happening, but I do sort of see the value of the class based views (but can't quite wrap my head around that yet). so my question: do you (or can you) do a tutorial that makes that connection of converting/using CBV? (Or maybe you do it later in this series and obviously I'm at Part 5). But, like the function view of def register(request): ...   how would that look or be used as a CBV?",True
