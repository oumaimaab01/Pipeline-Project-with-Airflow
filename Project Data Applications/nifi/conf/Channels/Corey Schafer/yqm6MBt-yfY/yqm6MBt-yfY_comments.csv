@anony88,2019-03-05T16:27:33Z,4,"I did something similar recently on my own. I made a python script to scan a company's 'careers' page for a job that I should be getting. It's opening up soon and a former manager is trying to help me get on. It detects how many pages there are(usually around 19 pages of results total) using the pagination text at the bottom of the page, then it will go through every list page and open up every job page on each list page to scan the whole page for a specific keyword. I think it opens like 120 or so job pages. I put like a 5 second delay in between each job page scan so it's not excessive, and in between each complete scan I make it wait around 40-60 minutes so that way it's not constantly loading pages all day. Once it finds the job im looking for, it will use the pushbullet python package using pushbullets api to send a notification to my phone. The pushbullet api is great and easy to use. I could easily add something similar to my reddit scanner, like a breaking news alert for example.",True
