@abraham_o,2023-05-08T06:17:35Z,4,"Idempotency in programming means that an operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. For example, if we have a function that gets a cow pregnant and we apply it twice, the cow cannot get more pregnant than she already is, so the result will not change. This property ensures the reliability and consistency of operations in distributed systems or situations with potential duplicate requests.",True

@GandalftheWise,2022-09-16T22:48:14Z,0,My wife said for me to see the doctor because I may be idempotent. This video has left me confused,True
@sebastiandelbanorollin5482,2022-05-10T07:33:13Z,3,"Also, if x is a string, f(x)= upper case x  defines an idempotent  In maths an idempotent is often used to define a subspace of the values of x by f(x)=x. E.g uppercase strings.",True

@arod3295,2022-03-31T01:37:08Z,0,I have a question about the initial execution of PUT 'corey' mentioned @5:00 Would the URL become <url>/users=corey/123 ---and then every request afterwards has no effect?,True

@alixaprodev,2020-05-06T13:42:41Z,1,5:41 the best example of the post may be the working of the [like] button under the youtube video.  hhha,True
@mohamadhussien3575,2020-04-19T19:02:56Z,14,"This explanation from Microsoft is very good addition to Corey excellent effort, but more practical .    The reality of event-driven and message-based architecture dictates the need to accept identical requests while preserving data integrity and system stability.  To illustrate, consider an elevator call button. As you press the button, it lights up and an elevator is sent to your floor. A few moments later, someone else joins you in the lobby. This person smiles at you and presses the illuminated button a second time. You smile back and chuckle to yourself as you're reminded that the command to call an elevator is idempotent.  Pressing an elevator call button a second, third, or fourth time has no bearing on the final result. When you press the button, regardless of the number of times, the elevator is sent to your floor. Idempotent systems, like the elevator, result in the same outcome no matter how many times identical commands are issued.  When it comes to building applications, consider the following scenarios:  What happens if your inventory control application tries to delete the same product more than once? How does your human resource application behave if there is more than one request to create an employee record for the same person? Where does the money go if your banking app gets 100 requests to make the same withdrawal? There are many contexts where requests to a function may receive identical commands. Some situations include:  Retry policies sending the same request many times Cached commands replayed to the application Application errors sending multiple identical requests To protect data integrity and system health, an idempotent application contains logic that may contain the following behaviors:  Verifying of the existence of data before trying to execute a delete Checking to see if data already exists before trying to execute a create action Reconciling logic that creates eventual consistency in data Concurrency controls Duplication detection Data freshness validation Guard logic to verify input data  Ultimately idempotency is achieved by ensuring a given action is possible and is only executed once.",True

@kaiserdrache7675,2020-02-02T09:57:56Z,2,"I never knew there was a term for it, since the term itself matters not. I just do the work but don't try to label things.",True
@kaiserdrache7675,2020-02-02T09:56:44Z,0,"As Equilibris has eluded to, most functions are naturally idempotent.",True
@williamsrensen9802,2019-10-02T18:50:07Z,2,str() is too and its quite entertaining since whenever you declere a string it calls str so str('yeet') is the same as str(str('yeet')) so you can use str(str(str(str(str(str(str(str('yeet')))))))) and noone questions it.,True
@ineedsolution,2019-09-22T04:49:06Z,13,"As always -- simple explanation. I don't how are you doing, but your videos are the best sources of the knowledge that I I can get. Love it.",True

@SheldonHull,2019-04-24T00:37:09Z,0,"This was a great tutorial. I'm also interested in your presentation methodology. Did you use reveal-js and if so how did you have it flip to the vscode window during the presentation so smoothly? I'm using reveal-js but didn't see anyway to flip to vscode as a next window in it. Keep up the great work, I subscribed and will be sure to review more of your great content",True

@curiosull,2018-07-16T08:05:45Z,4,"POST technically means create a new resource. If you try to create the same resource twice, considering you have provided an ID, shouls be idempotent. PUT however can be used to update a value like +1",True
