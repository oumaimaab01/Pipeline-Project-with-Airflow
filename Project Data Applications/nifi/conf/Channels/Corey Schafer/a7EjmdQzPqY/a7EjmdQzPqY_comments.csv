@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-06T13:19:45Z,28,"Summary: Memoization refers to the mechanism that makes a function not having to compute the output using an input, when the function has been executed using the same input before. This is possible because the computer memorizes the input:output pair.   This tool can be demonstrated in python using an if statement and a dictionary outside the function.",True
@pipboy214,2020-02-09T00:03:49Z,0,"Maybe your video is good for a first grasp of the term, and you could say thats the point, but memoization is also a technique that doesn't need an external data structure to work, i sugest you to read and maybe talk about it, cause nobody wants dirty globals or spaghetti oriented programming, when You can implement a memoized pure function.",True
