Everything we've covered so far should be a good starting point for a lot of cool and interesting projects. But if you have any suggestions then let me know. I'm likely going to get back to some one-off videos on some different topics I've been wanting to cover, and I'm also working on material for my next series. I plan to cover a series on Docker soon since a lot of people seem to have difficulty with that. It's a great tool for spinning up different Python projects and also for putting them onto a production server. If you have suggestions for that series then let me know as well.",True

@MrEstate,2020-09-10T14:22:36Z,2,Could you do a video on using the Google API to access Google drive? I have been playing around with it and so far I was able to access it but it opens a web browser for authorizing my account. I put together some code to get around that but still not able to pull information from my files and folders. The goal I was trying for is to access a specific folder check to see if a new upload has been done and if so delete the current files in a folder and then move the new files into the folder. Thanks. Your videos are very helpful.,True

@coreyms,2020-09-10T02:38:54Z,152,"Hey everybody. I hope you find this video helpful. This will likely be the last video of the YouTube API series for a while. Everything we've covered so far should be a good starting point for a lot of cool and interesting projects. But if you have any suggestions then let me know. I'm likely going to get back to some one-off videos on some different topics I've been wanting to cover, and I'm also working on material for my next series. I plan to cover a series on Docker soon since a lot of people seem to have difficulty with that. It's a great tool for spinning up different Python projects and also for putting them onto a production server. If you have suggestions for that series then let me know as well.",True
