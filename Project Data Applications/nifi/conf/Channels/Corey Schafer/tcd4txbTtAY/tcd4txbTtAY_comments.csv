@jensmohrmann4140,2019-08-15T14:37:16Z,0,"very good explanation. The only thing I would enhance to explain the function of '*' is to show the output of ""echo *"" instead of ""ls *"", because ls already interprets '*' while echo only prints the shells interpretation of '*'.",True

@dhruvmingandhi2026,2017-11-14T08:08:07Z,0,Have you done a video on Merge vs. Rebase?  I don't really understand why you would ever want to merge over rebase.  I understand that merging preserves the history but I don't understand why that is beneficial.,True

@1truefreedomfighter,2017-06-27T13:45:15Z,2,"Great tutorials!! I'll plan to visit your patreon soon.  The shell interprets the ""*"" and enumerates all filenames in the current directory in its place. Type ""echo *"" to see exactly what it does.  Tip: Use echo to view commands containing the ""*"". (eg: ""echo git add *"") Notice ""ls *"" in this example will give the same output as ""ls modified.txt my_dir new_file.txt""  Since the * will not pickup files that don't exist, it doesn't add your deleted file. Since the * added the dirname, you got the deleted tracked files in ""git add -A my_dir"".  ref: http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html",True
@lookalike6270,2017-04-24T15:57:20Z,0,Tutorial is failing at 1:20.  Won't progress pass that point.,True
@sunzaolive,2017-03-21T14:05:00Z,0,"Thanks for the upload, they were especially helpful for GUI user. Like you state in the first video, sometimes you just got stuck in the GUI, cmd lines are more reliable (ofc you have to know what you are doing . :P)  and i love speed up play XD PS: one tiny suggestion, my friend was confused during the diffmerge tool video, he didn't understand how the merge conflict happened since i told him to only commit on the current working branch.(he never committed anything in any other branches. such a disciplined dude.) maybe add a short explanation in that video of how the conflicts happened to remind a bit. but anyway, great job, man! :D Thanks for your time and effort!",True
@thegripmaster666,2017-01-26T05:05:28Z,5,Your tutorials on git are the best I've ever watched. Thank You! Please do make a video on git rebase,True
@virgo47,2016-10-19T15:39:21Z,2,"Great tutorial series. If you want to see what is passed when * is used, don't use ""ls *"", but rather ""echo *"" - that does not expand/interpret anything in any way, just prints what bash/shell gives you for *. So yes, it added two files and one dir just as you assumed. Funny thing about * is that you can just write it alone on the command line and try to ""run"" it. E.g. if you ""touch ls some stuff"" then * will expand to ""ls some stuff"" so it actually runs ls command. :-) Not practical, dangerous even.",True
@helenlundeberg,2016-09-18T21:02:12Z,0,honestly this channel explains git so clearly I'd recomment anyone learning git. Stackoverflow and official tutorials can get extremely verbose and confuse for the non-expert compared to these videos.,True
@griffinb2008,2016-09-02T20:16:07Z,11,"I recently learned about git add -p and don't know that I'll ever use anything else.  It allows you to add 'chunks' of your files, so if you have several changes in one file and you only want to commit one of those changes, it will allow you to do that interactively.",True

@prasadece2,2015-12-21T18:28:52Z,0,"Hey greate video.. can you make some videos on git flow, branching & their differences.. thanks :)",True
@AntonKastritskiy,2015-09-23T08:30:55Z,10,Wow I was literally googling the difference between these commands an hour ago and now I open my YouTube feed and see this. Great work Corey!,True
