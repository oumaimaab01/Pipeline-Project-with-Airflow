I know that many speak about problems in installing these libraries into PyCharm.

With the very basic Python I just open up the IDLE, make a new script and then do the very core aspect of all of this, coding. This is my second time trying to use and like Anaconda (the first time was at the beginning of my python programming course at Uni). Now that I know how to code I still can't get along with Anaconda. What use is there in all this package and envornment management when you can't do the actual coding? Why does it need to be hid behind everything that is supposed to complement your actual coding? Or am I totally missing the prupose/functionality of Anaconda? Are you supposed to download and run someones scripts and never write your own? With something like Eclips for Java you also have environment managing but opposed to Anaconda the focus is still the UI in which you program your code... How is Anaconda simplifying anthing that _beginners_ might run into? Bollocks, sorry.",True
