@Acecool,2020-01-03T20:17:01Z,0,"For #3, good ideas are simple games using existing packages, such as pyglet... being able to create a game, even if it is simple, such as one I did in college - it turned out to be the most advanced in the class which was kind of sad, but... it took a background, of any size, and a crosshair stuck to the center until you are at the edges then it unlocked. The camera was separate and you'd shoot at birds. There was a reload sequence with proper mechanics. ie: reload an empty gun and get 7 rounds, or 6+1. reload the magazine and you get 7+1. simple animations for flying, for dying, etc. -- there was music, bullet spread, and other mechanics in place. ie: A lot was demonstrated and it also demonstrated that you can look up documentation, interpret them correctly, and implement your own ideas.   Another one is integrating package contents into one of your projects. This can be anything.   Another one I did was to create photoshop style filters, and image manipulations using jython, I think it was... such as simple desaturation, to stretching / transforming in various directions, to drawing a border of little boxes which don't delete the image, just alter the color, another one with static - with or without removing detail... and more.   I've done so much, it's hard to list them all - but so far all of your suggestions are good - I'll continue from 3.   For #9, it should be general questions... Programming questions... ie:   Does your company have a set coding standard, if not - why not. If so, what are some of the specifications... UpperCamelCase, lowerCamelCase, airy( coding ), or(not), do you use tabs or spaces. My preference is tabs because it can take a 1MB file down to 100KB ( real world situation and it is massive in terms of waste ) despite the 'guidelines' from PEP8 say to use 4 spaces....   If no coding standard - evaluate the code, and come up with one - because maintaining code that looks like it was written by 50 different people is ugly, hard to read, etc... Ask if they like to repeat code, or if they create building blocks so they only have to update in one place vs hundreds. You'd be surprised how many people code this way and duplicate code - find a tiny issue such as gui code and accidentally didn't consider that the screen starts at 0, 0 and have a 1px discrepancy and have to now fix that in all of their gui code instead of just the functions.   It is always good to know SQL - but writing SQL can be very tedious especially the more advanced stuff... I ended up writing something in Lua, for a game framework I was working on - and I plan on porting it to a few other languages, which generates SQL based on very simple instructions. It can generate queries that are pages long - stuff ranging from simple 1 line queries, to joins, pivots, and more by just typing out a few lines of code such as new query. add where, join.. update vs retrieve - etc...   The downside to writing these systems that write SQL for you, even if you designed it and it works flawlessly is the fact that it works flawlessly... Because you now use it for everything - you no longer write SQL. If you can generate a 3 page query with a few lines of simple calls - why waste time writing a 3 page query? Practice - obviously, but if you are working on a project, time matters...   Python properties are useful to know about. Dynamically generating functions, etc.. also very useful.",True

It is important no doubt but what is also important is that you should believe in your abilities and be passionate. Some might get an early break while some may not. What matters is that you should never ever give up! Technological advances will carry on forever. In today's world a person should have a flexible mindset and ready to learn new skills. I am in education since 2007. This is going to be my 4th degree. And 3rd master's. This time from Trinity College. I am 29 years of age. Ialso have some working experience. But the main thing is that I am still motivated and going on. I was always at a distance from these technologies. But lately I have developed a taste for them and started understanding the functioning of the various systems. I have learned Sas, SOLIDWORKS, Ansys, r, and now learning python and SQL. The best thing is that there is so much information available nowadays that any one can study and that too at their own pace. So, just keep on going and don't think much. All the best to all.

Finally, what would you say is the best course of action for someone who is already in a career and learning Python/programming in their free time but is interested in changing careers to programming?
