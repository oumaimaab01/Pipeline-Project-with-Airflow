@KranthiKumarSesham,2021-05-17T18:04:02Z,0,"Named Tuples in Python are High-performance container datatypes used mainly for readbility and less typing Sometimes we need something between a tuple and a dictionary. Tuples have less typing to do but it is easy to forget what each values stand for.  In contrast, Dictionaries are very wordy, while we can assign the keys to what the value represents. Using named tuple makes the meaning of each value explicit while not being as wordy as Dictionary.  from collections import namedtuple   # Regular tuple # color = (55,155,255) # dictionary # color = {'red': 55, 'green': 155, 'blue': 255}  from collections import namedtuple  # create a template of the namedtuple, as below color = namedtuple('color', ['red', 'green', 'blue'])   #create as many named tuple(s) using that template, as below shade_1 = color(55,155,255) # or shade_1 = color(blue=55,green=155,red=255) shade_2 = color(255,255,255)  # We can now use access each value either by index or by using ""."" operator on named tuple  # '.red', '.blue', or '.green' at the end of the name of tuple, to access each value print (shade_1.blue) # or print(shade_1[0]) print (shade_2.blue)",True

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-06T10:20:59Z,0,"I have a problem follwing the tutorial. I use python 3.7, and whenever I do *print(color['red'])* like in the video, the console says I'm in an error where index can only be integers. However, when I do *print(color.red)* , 255 does get printed out on the console. I don't understad why Corey can do it but not me. Also, I do not understand how corey can use the print function without using the parenthesis. In my system, I have to do   *print('hello world')* , and *print 'hello world'* does not work.:d Can someone help me find whats' wrong with me?

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-06T10:16:44Z,29,"Summary: Sometimes we need something between a tuple and a dictionary. Tuples have less typing to do but it is easy to forget what each values stand for. In contrast, Dictionaries are very wordy, while we can assign the keys to what the value represents.   Using named tuple makes the meaning of each value explicit while not being as wordy as Dictionary.   How: 1. from collections import namedtuple 2. set a template of the namedtuple, as below. *Color = namedtuple('Color', ['red', 'blue', 'green'])* 3. create a named tuple using that template, as below *red_color = Color(255, 0, 0)*   4. now a namedtuple is created. We can use indexing to access each value, but can also add '.red', '.blue', or '.green' at the end of the name of tuple, to access each value, too. *print(red_color.red)* *print(red_color[0])*   both will print out 255 in the console.",True

@fupopanda,2018-12-10T05:39:35Z,132,"For those experienced with using OOP, here is some helpful information not mentioned in this video:  namedtuple returns a class (that's a child of the built-in class tuple). The first argument you pass to namedtuple becomes the name of the class, while the list of strings becomes the attributes (data fields). You can then call the constructor (the line of code before the print() method in the video) to make objects.",True
