The ""L"" mode that you used for converting your image into black and white, is actually for converting an image into greyscale. A black and white image only consists of 2 colors (Black & White) and the image that you converted had several shades of grey(0-255).   For Converting an image into black and white you have to use ""1"" mode which stands for 1 bit per pixel which truly resembles a Black & White image, use that in disabled dither mode to actually see the black and white image otherwise you will see you image with grainy noise.  You can sort of see this just by looking at the image, a black and white image should just contain black and white not any other color.",True
