@joelprestonsmith,2023-02-21T14:12:33Z,1,"I figured out what I was doing wrong (regarding why my builds were not showing up under Tools → Build Systems); you HAVE to save a build in the User folder FOR Sublime Text. NOT the USERS folder that's native to Mac. In the video, you can see that the User folder is the one that's chosen for the python version being saved in this tutorial, but there's no audible mention of it, or the importance of it. Corey does illustrate how to find that folder by going to Sublime Text → Preferences → Packages (you'll then see the User directory). In the first instance of your creating a build system, the User folder will be listed as the default directory for where the file will be stored. Don't change it! Otherwise your build will NOT show up in the list of built systems.",True

@genelee1356,2017-08-10T02:12:51Z,0,"Corey, It seems Zboyy and I have exactly the same problems.  I made some progress.  On Terminal, both /Library/Frameworks/... and /usr/local/bin/Python3 work.  But with Custom Sublime Text Build, 2.7 works.  For Python3, though, it doesn't get to either /Library/... or /user/local/bin.  As Zboyy said, the Build searches [path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin] and misses /usr/local/bin/.  Do we have to somehow specify the path in the custom build for Python3?  Thanks.",True

I ""default"" installed Python 3.6.2 fro Python.org (following your Tutorial for Beginners 1).  Then I tried to ""Custom Sublime Text Build"" 2.7 and 3.6 as you did there.  Then I saw this difference between yours and mine - ""which version 3.6"" gives me /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3.6, NOT /usr/local/bin/python3.6 which is what you have.  Is there any way I can have mine like yours?  Thanks.",True
