For example, if you have multiple tests that require a database, you could group all those tests into a single class and have the setUpClass() method prepare the db.  Tests that don't involve the db would go into other test classes.  The larger the overall project, the more test classes you are likely to have.",True

@BabyBalla3score,2019-06-12T00:17:59Z,0,"What's the point of unit testing? I've seen articles saying it's to test the smallest units of code possible and make sure they run as intended but what if you already have a good idea of what exceptions to handle and when to handle them. Say you are making a medium sized script (like a few hundred lines) with a bunch of functions that are passed arguments that can be quite different at times. Is it possible to test functions that rely on input(arguments to be set) from other functions or functions that are called within other functions? Also, for smaller things like scripts, wouldn't it be fine to just make exceptions for the code at first and add more if need be? If you don't know what to expect when first writing the code and end up encountering something that throws an error then you probably wouldn't have accounted for that in a test either. What's the difference if the script is failing or if the test case is failing? As I write this, I am now thinking of the assert statement and how heavily used it is in testing. If you develop with some of these assertion rules in mind like param1 for foo(param1, param2) must be an int then why would you need to go write a unit test for it?  Sorry for the long question. I have a hard time seeing why this would be useful. Especially if you run a script a few times and clear any issues that you didn't account for at first.  Why go write a unit test after that?",True

@geoptus,2017-08-20T00:57:11Z,0,"Hi Corey, yet again another excellent tutorial. With this invaluable lesson, I can finally de-clutter my scripts/classes from all those messy checking print statements all over the place. Also thoroughly enjoying the oop tuts for python. Classes and objects are finally making sense thanks to that series.  Just one tiny observation, the 'else' in the monthly_schedule method is unnecessary (although, I imagine this may look clearer to many, even to myself), though it still works like this.  Many thanks for all this work and commitment.",True
