@berglerlemur,2018-01-25T05:21:04Z,0,"Hi Corey, your videos are definitely some of the best Python tutorials out there. But one thing I feel is missing is accompanying excercises. It would be great if in the video descriptions for each video there were some practice problems to solve. I feel like it's a huge part of learning.   I know that there are excercises available online and in books but it would be great if there were CSchafer ones that married up perfectly with the video content.  Even if you suggested that viewers posted excercises in the comments, a great way for the experienced to teach/challenge the inexperienced.",True
@Lowzenza4,2018-01-19T22:56:22Z,0,I was wondering if you could do example cases of tough python code.

@CreeperHaunterDavid,2017-12-18T19:19:26Z,0,"Hello, Corey. I just wanted to say thanks for your videos,  after watching them all other tutorials i've seen so far seemed lacking. Unfortunately I dont earn my own money yet (cs student), so I cant show my support on Patreon, but I'll be sure to in the future, since your videos helped me so much. Keep up the good work and have a wonderful 2018! :)",True
@RC-bl2pm,2017-12-18T19:12:14Z,0,Corey. You've taught me a lot this year!  I started learning python and you were instrumental in helping over a few hurdles...multiclass inheritance and regular expressions...there were more but especially those. In the new year I will be moving on to flask as I now have a middling grasp of python. When I get stuck I would sure love a Corey Schafer video to get me out of the ditch! So if you're assessing interest put down one for flask...later django! When it comes to understanding the perspective of someone who is on their first look at a new subject your understanding of what they will snag on is unmatched. You're a natural teacher.Thanks again have a great christmas and happy new year!,True

Why do you think web2py framework is (apparently) not much in vogue lately? Everywhere I look, people are teaching flask and/or django. web2py on the other hand seems easier, which led me to this question, if you wish to share your opinion.",True
