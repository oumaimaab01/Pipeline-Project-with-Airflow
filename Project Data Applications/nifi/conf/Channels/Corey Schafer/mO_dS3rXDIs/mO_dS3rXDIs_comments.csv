@Tapajara,2023-03-14T14:20:28Z,0,"Python is a very bad programming language in so many ways. I think that beginners who really want to know how computers work should certainly not start to learn programming with this terrible language because it will ruin their perceptions of how computers actually work. The C language requires you to conform your thinking to how the computer works. Python, on the other hand, tries to guess at what you mean and generates the code that does what it thinks you want to happen. And it burns up 99% of your computer's power in doing this guess work.",True

@davidcarter8932,2020-06-24T18:12:40Z,1,"Your videos are exceptional. I enjoy them all. In this one it would help to expand a little on when to use ""is"" or ==. Linter seems to want me to use ""is"" in logical comparisons, but doesn't complain about == in other comparisons. So, should we use ""value is True"" and  ""x == y""?  ""Value is True"" seems to work, but I don't trust it based upon your description about having identical memory locations. Are True and False assigned fixed memory locations and logical variables assigned one of those two memory locations? Since I don't know the answer, I am inclined to always use == which may not be pretty, but it works. What do you think?",True
