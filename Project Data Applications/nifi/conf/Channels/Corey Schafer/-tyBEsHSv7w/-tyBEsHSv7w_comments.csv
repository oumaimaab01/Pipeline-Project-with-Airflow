In addition as earlier stated by some who commented, all the email must be the same. You must use the same email all through the section for all areas. Again, you are required to create a registration  folder to keep all the templates in the users app. Do not create and use users folder as was used in the tutorial. This might have worked 5 years ago but not anymore. Create a folder named 'registeration' instead of the ''users'''folder created and used here. I hope this helps.",True

@TheUSDA__,2023-06-08T23:55:03Z,7,"For anyone who may have had troubles with the error message ""SMTPSenderRefused at /reset-password/"" the solution is very simple. Google removed the ability to have less secure applications be able to access your information, so what you will need to do:  1. Turn on two step authentication. 2. Go into app passwords, create a new application, and get a password. 3. Go into advanced system settings and create a new environment variable for your email and password. The environment variable names should be equal to EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in this case. 4. Set the EMAIL_USER equal to your email address and the password equal to the app password that you generated during step two  What will now happen is django will use the environmental variables values to log in and send emails.  Hope this helps!",True

I am just a beginner in programming and looked around to find a full-fledged Django project to follow. Some of them where helpful indeed, but this one is certainly the best prepared one! Moreover, unlike many others it still works with Django 2.2.7 and Python 3.7! So, it was worthy of every minute I spent on it. Thank you so much, Sir! You are a big talent!

Head into your python shell by running python manage.py shell  2. Check whether your environment variables are loaded by running the below code import os print(os.environ.get('EMAIL_USER'))  # or any other name you gave your variable  3. If it does not return your email then it is highly likely that your OS refers to another file when loading environment variables; in my case it is .bashrc instead of .bash_profile  4.

@gaylonalfano,2018-10-14T12:33:21Z,0,"Phenomenal series! I usually watch other videos at 1.5x but there are parts in this series that I had to slow you down to .75 speed. Hah! Every second of this series is packed with relevant information. Keep up the fantastic work!  Two questions for you if/when you get the time: 1. If I wanted to create a website for a small business that has this sort of customer login/portal functionality (e.g., users could see reports, information, etc. specific to them), would you build it from scratch with Django like we've been doing? Or, would you get something more out-of-the-box with say, Wordpress, and then add on/integrate the Django functionality? I'd like to create a website of my own but I love the Django functionality you've introduced so I don't know what's the best route to take.   2. Do you have any resources or suggestions for us to continue learning about this while you're working on future videos? I assume the official documentation is a place to start, but just wondering if there's some other good resources you'd recommend for us who've gone through this particular series.  Regardless, thank you again for the fantastic series and I certainly cannot wait to see your future videos!",True
