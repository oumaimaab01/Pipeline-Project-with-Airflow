@lalaithan,2018-02-16T18:02:10Z,3,I think the biggest reason why this idea isn't popular is that people nowadays want to jump right into paying jobs with no way to prove that you're a good investment for the company. People like the easy path and those of us who didn't go to school for it most definitely need a portfolio of some sort.,True
@lalaithan,2018-02-16T18:00:16Z,1,"Sharing for those that come along, you could advertise on Craigslist or a free community message board that you are offering your skills and time, either tutoring or doing projects to build up your portfolio. Ask nonprofits/charities if they need tech help. Volunteer websites like volunteermatch.com and catchafire.com also have listings for volunteer groups asking for help.",True
@MyTube4Utoo,2017-11-26T16:48:40Z,21,"A great video, resources, and message. It does concern me somewhat that it's only received 1,694 views, especially considering it was published on April 27, 2015. I can't wait until I know enough about programming/web development to offer my skills to help others.",True
@code.sydney,2017-04-24T12:25:27Z,2,Thanks for sharing your insights about volunteering. We have started a similar initiative in Sydney recently and hoping to get more volunteer work in the future.,True
