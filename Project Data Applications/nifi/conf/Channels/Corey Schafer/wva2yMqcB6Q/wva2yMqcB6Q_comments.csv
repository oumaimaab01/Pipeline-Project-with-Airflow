In terms of pure SQL I currenly know how to do basic and more complex queries (inner join, left outer join, right outer join, full join, group by,  aggregate functions, union). In terms of relational databases knowledge I'm aware of transactions, ACID, transaction isolation levels, various keys  (Primary, Foreign), indexes (i'm aware of how and what they do), relations(1:1, 1:M, M:M).
