@911arrow4,2018-05-20T21:53:47Z,3,"I can tell you100% time if my dogs have to go pee or poop,need food or water.  All by them looking dirctly at me and sticking their tongue out just as a person would at another person. I dont know anyone who reads dogs like this.  One time my dog took off after something and I yelled for him to come back and in mid air he turns head and sticks tongue out at me.  I immediately knew that he was communicating with me and I only know 4 things that it could mean. So put him on leash and explored and it happened to be food.  huge elk head.  If i take my dog out to go potty and all needs seem to be taken care and he just relieved himself but again sticks tongue out at me...i know for a fact he will have to relieve himself one more time.   The only other time my dog has stuck tongue out is when he had to throw and he did throw up.   My border collie will become extremely hyperactive and try to escape leash if he is very tired. Anytime he becomes crazy hyperactive it is always because he has done too much and is extremely tired.   I saw lady on the trail and about 45 minutes later her and old dog come by my house  He is also now behaving hyper as he is messing with leash she says he embarrassed about. He was clearly tired.  Most people dont have this pronlem because they never exercise pets enough.   I so know this behavior to be true. You need to get dog immediately rested at this point.  Then insane behavior stops.",True
