@Canda-fh4xc,2019-02-03T03:58:23Z,2,"Thank you Corey for the awesome videos .. After finishing both Flask and Django series. My opinion. Django is really bad framework. To build a major web application it can be very confusing and annoying. Django force you to follow  their way to create any simple task. And this  will kill your creativity and your programming skill. It is more about memorizing their way to build the application. Yes so much fun stuff are built in for you and you can implement them out of the box, but you have no clue how functions were built,  which will make it hard to  modify any built functions. While flask will give you a flexible way to build everything the way you want to build it.  Without any ambiguous or hidden functions or configurations.",True
