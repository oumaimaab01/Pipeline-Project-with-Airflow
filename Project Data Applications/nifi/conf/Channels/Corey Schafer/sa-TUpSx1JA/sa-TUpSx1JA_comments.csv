One thing I miss though is not all languages support matching regexes for example if you have function in any language which has same scope delimiter as inner scopes, say {}, there aren't many languages that support regexes to match them and find start and end of function.  You can use forward looking regex but it is neither efficient nor simple.",True

@nigelblanchard5571,2019-05-03T08:34:19Z,0,Superb video on RegEx and such a great presenter of this subject. I know nothing about programming and was looking for REGEX for absolute beginners because so many sites make the assumption that we are all programmers and know such things as PYTHON - having said that I will have a look at some of your Python start up stuff. Thanks once more for the effort and clear decent presentation so obvious that you did some proper presentation homework and prepared with materials. I would love a couple of things would it possible to post those demo snippet and other files you used with Atom that I have now installed along with Data fake files etc. You also mentioned that you had a mind to do a more advanced vid on RegEx - have you produced that and where can I find that as I looked on the menu for the fee part of your project but could not see it referred to. I dont expect you to give us all a freebie but most of your other stuff is in relation to more programming and I have just started to learn REGEX for Libre Office efficiency and am some way of going forward to programming.

@peterlewerin4213,2019-04-16T10:35:15Z,0,"This is a good introduction, but it distresses me that so many seem to draw the conclusion that regexps are simple to work with. I have been programming for ~40 years and used many regexp-based tools like awk, grep, parser generators, etc, and I consider regexps to be very insidious. Quite manageable, of course, but they *will* bite you if you aren't careful. Viewers who are RE beginners should keep in mind that these are simple, clear examples to show the basics of regexps. These examples are riding a bike with training wheels on an empty street. A lot more effort is required for anything beyond trivial matching (such as finding text in an editor). For reliable data capture, even the more complex email-matching regexp introduced at 28:57, for instance, is inadequate.",True

Fortunately it's legacy syntax similar to ""let"" and ""var"" that is readily transferable between languages, but was careful to check with the documentation to see if the examples that you gave were valid in Swift.  I appreciate the lecture and found it the most concise and easy to follow among many here on YouTube. If you have time and are still enthused I think that many would like to see a follow up video detailing more complex search criteria on the matter.  It's also interesting to see Atom behave like the Playground with instant results, I didn't expect anything I am learning in Swift to be applicable outside of the IDE, let alone in the search field of many other apps!

I used groupings to find certain parameters in a large file and it is a particular number that comes after a variable name so I have something like (variable)(number) but using regex. In python, I'd want to just call the (number) group in my re.findall expression so would it be:  string = ""Job 1: modeltype 6 some random words (xx: 76) -55 runtime 500s"" matches = [] # I need only the number that comes after xx: pattern = r""(xx:\s+)(\d*) for match in re.findall(????): matches.append(match)  How do I just pull out group 2 which is (\d*) that comes after the first group without modifying the original text? There are multiple of those strings for a bunch of models each with a (xx: ###) and I am trying to pull out those numbers and save them into a list. Right now I am just appending that whole expression and striping the ""xx :"" part. It works but I thought calling the group from the start would be neater.",True

@dhstein1,2017-10-14T14:09:43Z,0,"Great tutorial.  Thanks.  If possible, could you provide the regex to match only the first group in a string.  For example in ABCDEFGCDEZYXW how would you get a match for CDE that would match ABCDE and not return ABCDEFGCDE.  This is where you don't know what the start of the string is.  So it could ZYXWVCDEABCDEQTS and you just want the beginning of the string up to the first CDE.  Thanks",True
