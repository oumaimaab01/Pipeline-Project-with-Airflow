If you want to provide a method accessible only to the class that changes its class attribute, you should not do this but instead simply access ClassName.Attribute inside of a method without self or cls - it won't be accessible to any object, but it will be to the class itself.

I have only one question: where you have discussed the class methods, you have defined the instantiate_from_csv method, and despite the fact that we have given the class as the first argument to the method, you used name of class to instantiate, is it not better to use the cls instead of item. Also, this method has no return value. Is it not necessary to return the created objects? I change the method definition to this:     def instantiate_from_csv(cls):         with open('codesnippets/items.csv', 'r') as f:             reader = csv.DictReader(f)             items = list(reader)          instances = list()         for item in items:             instances.append(cls(                 name=item.get('name'),                 price=float(item.get('price')),                 quantity=int(item.get('quantity')),             ))         return instances Is it better and yet tru or what? Thanks again!",True

As far as the @classmethod from_string is concerned, I noticed that the    return cls(first,last,pay) does not include self as an argument. How can python store the name of a new object that we define by calling a @classmethod that returns cls() ? More specifically,  how is new_emp_1 passed as an object's name? Is it the case that every time we create an object by calling a class, the variable's name is used as the object's name, even if we call a @classmethod where, by default, no ""self"" is included ?

I just figured out why we would use class method : you could do the same with a static method or even a instance method and write the class name when you need it (like ""class_name.method"")     BUT !   -  if you do that and whant to change the class name for ""class_name_2"" you have to edit your *entire* code to replace it one by one. If you used a class method the ""cls"" argument will just pass the new name without even noticing something changed. THANKS !",True

@user-xc5xf8gp8n,2020-03-09T16:00:11Z,1279,"Summary: In this video, Corey distinguishes between a regular method, class method, and a static method.   Firstly, a regular method is the type of method that we are used to seeing since the start of OOP tutorials. It is accessible through both the class and the instance, which means that we can call for the method in both Employee.method() and emp_1.method() they automatically have the instance as the first positional argument, as self.   Secondly, class methods are the type of method used when a method is not really about an instance of a class, but the class itself. To create a class method, just add '@classmethod' a line before creating the class method. The class is automatically the first argument to be passed in, and is represented as 'cls' instead of 'class'. This is because 'class' is already assigned to be something else in Python. There are 2 ways of using the class method as far as Corey has shown.   First is modifying the class variable. Corey modified the 'raise_amount' class variable using a class method. Just remember that to access a class variable, we have to write 'cls.' before specifying the actual name. For example, as 'cls.raise_amount' as in the video.   Second is making an alternative constructor. Sometimes people have information of their specific instances of the class available in a specific format. Corey shows an example of this where first and last names and pay are separated by a hyphen. Corey creates a class method that returns the class with the specific values passed in that are obtained by using split() method to the string passed in. User of the script can now automatically create a new instance without having to parse the string at '-'.   Corey then moves on to cover static methods. Static methods are different from regular methods an class methods in that it doesn't have a class or instance that is automatically passed in as a firs positional argument. They can be created by adding '@staticmethod' a line before defining the method. These are methods that have a logical connection to the Class, but does not need a class or instance as an argument. Corey says that it is better to make sure we create a static method rather then class or regular method when we are sure that we don't make use of the class or instance within the method.",True

@chriss.7772,2020-03-01T13:43:32Z,0,"Now I have one question. If I construct emp_1 with the defined raise_amount of 1.04 and then call the classmethod set_raise_amt(1.05), the printed result of emp_1.raise_amount will be 1.05. So if I change the overall class variable, this changes each in instance of the class. So far so good...  But then, if I specifically change one of the values, e.g: emp_1.raise_amount = 1.06 and then after that run the classmethod set_raise_amt(1.05) again, I would expect the individual change to be overridden and the result to be 1.05, yet it isnt. It prints 1.06.    So what I assume happens here is that the call of ""emp_1.raise_amount = 1.06"" changes what emp_1.raise_amount points at. Namely it stops pointing at the original class variable Employee.raise_amount and instead becomes the fixed value 1.06. Was this explained in Tutorial 2, because I might have missed it? I think this makes quite a remarkable difference. Also if Im wrong here, I would like to hear what really happens underneath.  This behavior also begs the question: Is there a way to set all raise_amount variables to a given value by calling a classmethod AFTER I set some of the employee raise_amounts individually?",True

If you were to execute the apply_raise() function on that new_emp_1 variable, the function would try to multiply a float by a string, getting an error. We need to convert that string to an integer So that line 34. should read:    new_emp_1 = Employee(first, last, int(pay)) Same goes for the subsequent from_string classmethod created using the same way.

But When you showed with instance emp1.set_raise_amt(1.05) it affects the class attribute and the next instance which may be emp2 also gets the value which was changed by emp1.

Is there any practical difference?

Just wandering what the disadvantages of doing something like this would be : Or is it just to do with logic / easy of reading?   class car:     paintjob = ""Cool Boy""          def __init__(self, weight, colour):         self.colour = colour          self.weight = weight         self.paintjob = self.paintjob      @staticmethod     def string_create(stron):         weight, colour = stron.split(""_"")         return car(weight, colour)  car_lol = car.string_create(""fifty_pink"")      print (car_lol.colour)",True

@sizzler8730,2016-10-07T12:23:53Z,0,"1) Could you let me know the entire function definition for @classmethod decorator. I am new to python and trying to learn about decorators. Wanted to know how this internally works such a way that we dont have to explicitly give the class name I am expecting to see a <classname>.<method>(<classname>) inside the @classmethod decorator, because, from what i tested, i am assuming this is how we would be able to access class name in a method defined in the class without the use of the decorator since we are explicitly sending classname here.   2) What is the exact need for @staticmethod decoarator. Because i have tried and seen that even if we dont give this decorator, we can still call the method using <classname>.<method>(<arguments>). I am not just able to see the benefit of using this.",True
