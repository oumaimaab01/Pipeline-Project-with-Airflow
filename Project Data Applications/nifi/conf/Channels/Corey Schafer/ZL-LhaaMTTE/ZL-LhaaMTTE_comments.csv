@micah2936,2022-10-26T15:47:27Z,0,What about going backwards?

But I want to understand. I can get binary>decimal and hex>decimal But how do you easily figure out Decimal>binary and decimal>hex Or skip the middle man and just do Binary>hex and vise versa?,True

@kristoff_t2013,2022-06-21T21:27:36Z,0,"Hi! I'm a 13 years old programmer. Sorry for my bad english, but I'm my own teacher, and I learn english, programming and math. I made a program in C++ 11,  that can convert a number from a base 1-20 number system to an another base 1-20 number system. I'm currently developing this program, and I have done a lot since then. So it's also like 100x time faster when I'm converting from the decimal system to another, added the Mayan vigezimal number system, etc.  Before you watch my video, I want you to read the next things! In the video, NS means number system Sorry for not even trying to edit the video, but I made it just for myself, so I guess you can understand.  Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYSZqaqc9cU I hope you will like the program, and the timestamps will help you navigate.",True

@getrekt3983,2021-01-01T05:04:24Z,0,jesus you could compare apples to bananas and come up with the same fruit couldn't you lmao. the reason base 10 is easy is because when all you have to do is type the numbers in order to have it make sense 1/10/100/1000 and you know exactly what number that represents without having to go thorough the exponents of it all... that being said thank you for the video. it did help with my understanding lmao,True

@russellscott7062,2017-07-31T12:11:42Z,3,"Brilliant explanation! I'm studying web development & at the moment I'm following a tutorial on implementing HTML5 sliders to create variable numeric values between 0-255, then using JS  logic, convert 10 base to 16 & concatenate the result with a  pretended hash to derive at a color code( like #71726a which is yellow ). Then use the color codes to dynamically change the background color of a web-page. The tutorial was easy to follow & I understood all of it until I reached this syntax -- rdhex = (rd < 16) ? ""0"" + rd.toString(16) : rd.toString(16); This is a ternary operator, a conditional statement that checks if rd(a var) is less than 16 if true, concatenate 0 to the base 10 numeric value & set it to 16 base or just set the rd(var.value) to 16 base string. I didn't even know about bases let alone how they function as I left School at the age of 13y ;(  at the time I figured I would never use what I was being taught  -- I wish so much I had stayed now, as I love learning & teaching  for that matter + you know it's so empowering when you ""get it"" understanding is the best feeling right...
