The database presents a data interface for the potential users.  At minute 11 you say ""don't have to get your hands dirty with SQL"".    That's the fun part :)",True

When you created the blog app, Django seemed to recognize the ""blog"" concept somehow - we got an admin page out of the box, registering posts to the admin page was very easy...almost as if a blog is a built in template of some sorts. Are there other templates in Django, like, a twitter template? Or I got the whole thing wrong...which is very likely :)",True

@Oda3908,2020-07-07T02:44:37Z,0,"Excellent tutorials. Master Schafer never fails you. For those who feel confusing on those class variables in models, check python descriptor here. It looks very strange at the beginning, how could you assign a class variable and retrieve without conflicts. Each of those class variables is linked with a descriptor (e.g. models.TextField()), which will create an instance under the descriptor class. When you try to retrieve data from an instance (model level),  it will 'redirect' to a descriptor instance. You may imagine this system like puppetry, a class defined in models.py is one puppet, while the value passed in is held by those hands and fingers (descriptors) behind it, those class variables are just cables and sticks connecting between the puppet and the manipulator.  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/descriptor-in-python/",True

But there is another method you can use to create another instance of the Post object and save it all in one shot -  that is by using the ""create()"" method. From what I have found there isn't a right or wrong way with these two options, seems to just boil down to preference - Corey please feel free to respond I'm curious of your input. BTW I found this by following the official Django docs as I follow along his video.

The actual message may not exact the same but this is cause when I mess up something about the field and when do a makemigrations or migrate, it ask me how to deal with something about change NOT NULL REFERENCES to be NULL how I choose so while thinking that it is some serious problem I add some code and now when I look at SQL it said integer NULL REFERENCES , THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM.

@liquiddddd,2018-10-24T22:13:04Z,0,"Just went through this video and I really can't see why one would rather use this whole 'model' stuff instead of some other more direct DB interactions. Corey, you surely made this topic a lot easier to understand then the average 'Django material' available out there - as you usually do - but still... If I learn the concept behind Django's models I know how to interact with databases using Django, which is quite useful, yes, but it will eventually fade - as all web frameworks do. On the other hand, If I learn how to interact with databases using SQL, I learnt how to interact with all SQL databases in the world at once - yeah, I know it is not exactly like that, but it is certainly way more embracing. And considering most of DB interactions can be done via some quite trivial queries, then it isn't that big of a deal. As a matter of fact, I actually think that the way Django tries to abstract it via pure python code is harder than how I could probably do that via mysql-connector-python (which requires SQL queries), for example.",True
