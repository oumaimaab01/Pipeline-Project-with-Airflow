Edit: Like, if you notice a lot of repetition is used in websites, forms, design, forms, design, forms, design, and then the rest is just basic to intermediate functionalities.  I added a few extra functionalities after watching this video, such as dislikes and likes, and it‚Äôs ordered by likes-dislikes, so basically the popularity of the post, so say a post has 2 likes and 1 dislike and 1 post has 5 likes but 5 dislikes, the first one will be more popular because it has +1 instead of 0.",True

@Forlorn.,2018-08-21T07:23:44Z,0,"Hey Corey, I've got an issue where I've already created the post table, but I've realized in the aftermath that I don't want one of the inputs I had originally. This input originally had a nullable=False and when I comment that line out, it still expects me to put something in there because of the way I originally created the table I think. Also, I'm unable to reinitialize the table because of the package structure :(",True

@dziurappa,2018-07-20T11:21:38Z,0,"Hi Corey ! Awesome tutorials, thanks a lot, it helps me a lot since I'm a beginner. I have a problem which I believe it's pretty simple but I can't find a solution to it anywhere. I'm learning Django but I believe it's going to be similar in Flask. For example on website from this movie you have already 100 posts and you want to make a button for a user that allows him to pick 10 latest posts (not all of them). So my question is: How and where to put this sql logic ? in which file this function should be defined and how to use this function in .html ? Thank you in advance. Paul",True
