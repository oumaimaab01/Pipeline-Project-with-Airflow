@deutschersyrer,2021-01-04T11:23:48Z,0,"Hi Corey, Thank you very much for this tutorial. I am following along and learning a lot! I have a question please. After reading about the HTML ""main tag"" at   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main#Usage_notes  ""The content of a <main> element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of the page.""  Since the side bar is most likely not unique to a specific HTML template, I was wondering why you decided to have it inside HTML main tag then?  I would imagine that if you added that to another template rather than base.html, that would be better, but since it is in base.html and other templates are extending from base, that would not make it ""unique"".   I have done it as follows: Wouldn't that make more sense based on what the documentation points out?   in base.html:  ¬†¬†¬†¬†<main¬†role=""main""¬†class=""container""> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<div¬†class=""row""> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<div¬†class=""col-md-8""> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{%¬†block¬†content¬†%}{%¬†endblock¬†%} ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</div> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†{%¬†block¬†sidebar¬†%}{%¬†endblock¬†%} ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</div> ¬†¬†¬†¬†</main>   Only in home.html:  {%¬†block¬†sidebar¬†%} <div¬†class=""col-md-4""> ¬†¬†¬†¬†<div¬†class=""content-section""> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<h3>Blog¬†Sidebar</h3> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<p¬†class='text-muted'>Blog¬†Side¬†Bar¬†items¬†go¬†here.. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<ul¬†class=""list-group""> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<li¬†class=""list-group-item¬†list-group-item-light"">Latest¬†Posts</li> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<li¬†class=""list-group-item¬†list-group-item-light"">Announcements</li> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<li¬†class=""list-group-item¬†list-group-item-light"">Calendars</li> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<li¬†class=""list-group-item¬†list-group-item-light"">etc</li> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</ul> ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</p> ¬†¬†¬†¬†</div> </div> {%¬†endblock¬†sidebar¬†%}    Still in the main tag but at least I can show it only for specific pages?

@DanielRodrigues-nd4lu,2020-09-11T15:27:59Z,14,"For those who are seeing errors  following the last part of the video (around 42:00),  the base template  part href  = ""{%  url  < insert some url here >  %}"" , it is probably because of the Django version used in the video being outdated. Newer Django versions require  the addition of a namespace to the paths in the urls.py files (both project and app ones).   You can do this by going into the  project/urls.py  file and adding a ""namespace"" field inside the include function, for instance           path( ' ' , include( ' blog.urls ' , namespace = "" < insert you namespace here >"" ) )  Then, inside the base HTML file, on the  ""href"", you should basically add inside of the quotes the prefix  ' < the namespace > : ' before the url. More precisely:           href = {% url  ' < insert the namespace of the url that you want to use here > :  < insert the url here >  '   %}  On the blog/urls.py you can simply add a variable with a string after imports, for instance           blog_namespace = "" < insert the desired name here > ""  Hope that it helps.",True

Deleted the code and re-copy pasted both snippets making sure the spacing was good (will that effect anything? I'm TOTALLY new to this). Any ideas what is going wrong? Bothers me!
