(Master in Business Admin.), and I just got offered my first job. It's a traineeship, where they will teach my PHP and Javascript. (for Php Lavarel, and Angular/Node). Given my junior status, they will pay me not a normal developer salary, but quite a bit on the low side. (13 euro p¬†er hour, or ¬±2100 per month). I know that on average developers earn between 3000 and 4000 (perhaps 6k) per month in my country.  Given my academic background, I was expecting to earn more, but since this is a small company, I can't complain too much about the wage.
