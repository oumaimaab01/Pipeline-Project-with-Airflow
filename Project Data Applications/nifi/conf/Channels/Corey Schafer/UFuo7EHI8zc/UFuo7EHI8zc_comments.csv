@normoforan1444,2023-01-24T18:47:17Z,1,"Let me echo what plenty of others have said -- your videos are exceptionally well done and very understandable!! I knew virtually nothing about Python about two months ago and now I can do plenty of rudimentary, but useful stuff with it.  In working through this tutorial with data that I've exported from ThingSpeak, I get to the point of having pandas successfully (apparently) converting the str by using:  df['created_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at']).  I get no errors and it seems to recognize the datetime group automatically without providing formatting schema.  However, when I try to prove that it's now a datetime via the .day_name() method it throws an error and tells me my attribute is a datetime.datetime object and doesn't allow me to use that method.  I get the same results if I convert the created_at column via the read_csv() method at the initial import.  From forum searches I'm concluding that it got converted differently, than in your example, into a datetime object.  I don't totally understand what that means, but if I try different methods on those objects, I can manage to arrive at the same destination, which is to return the day of the week for a given date.  I used this strftime() method: print(datetime.strftime(df.loc[20001,'created_at'],'%A'))  IDK if you're still responding to comments on a 2 yo vid, but in case others ran into this problem, that's how I solved it. I'd be great to have a video on the datetime library (module ?) and how that's different and how to best use it. Maybe you've already done that, so I'll look for that next in your extensive list of videos, but if not, just a suggestion.  Again - thanks for all the amazing education efforts!!! cheers",True

@sandy73rocks,2020-12-01T13:32:02Z,0,"Hi, New to Pandas and just a bit confused: Firstly at 6:36 , we converted all the values of the Series to datetime type from String type using: df[‘Date’] = pd.to_datetime(df[‘Date’], format = ‘%Y-%m-%d %I-%p’) but when doing the same thing while loading csv 10:24, we used a lengthier approach of using a lambda and assigning it to date_parser argument. So my doubt is whether while following the later approach, do we basically apply a function(lambda in this case) to a column('Date') so that the function is applied to each value in that column and it converts each value(String) by calling strptime() ? If so, can we assume to_datetime() method converts a whole Series to datetime type while the later approach converts each value of a Series to datetime object? Is there any way we can replicate the former way while loading the csv file? That look minimal and easy. Thanks in advence",True

I have a data frame like so: Date           Change  2010-08-25    0.08 2010-08-26   -0.22 2010-08-27    0.04 2010-08-30   -0.08 2010-08-31   -0.11 ...            ... 2020-08-18    0.96 2020-08-19   -1.79 2020-08-20    5.04 2020-08-21   -0.84 2020-08-24   -1.10  The Date column is an index of course. What I want to do is basically partition this data by year. Once partitioned by year, I want to group consecutive rows by the sign of the change column such that consecutive negatives and consecutive positives are grouped together. Once that is done, I want to get the overlap of date ranges with matching sign for all years. For example, if change is positive from 2010-08-25 to 2010-08-27 and from 2011-08-26 to 2011-08-29 the common overlap would be 08-26 to 08-27, obviously accounting for all years not just 2.
