There is an efficient solution too (Without creating a separate dataframe).  country_grp[""LanguageWorkedWith""].apply(lambda x:(x.str.contains(""Python"").sum()/len(x))*100) Actually what I am doing here is, in the lambda function, at the return part, I divide the No. of python users by the length of the given series and then multiply it by 100.

I'll try later to use pivot_table() to make index the countries and the columns representing different social apps. Although it won't be tidy data, I think it will be useful to explore it.",True
,2020-02-14T17:49:00Z,4,"You should be able to get the percentage by simply using .mean() instead of .sum() in your apply(), since .str.contains returns a 0 or 1 for each row the mean of 0/1 values is the percentage of of 1 in total. The result would be in 0..1 range  (i.e. 0.48 for usa instead of 48) but you can then multiply the resulting series by 100 just like in Your example. One quirk is that if there are nulls in this question the .str.contains may return null for those rows and then the .fillna(0).mean() should get you the same results as in Your example. It's great though that You used this approach as not each problem can be solved with simple change and actually requires to compute multiple series, combine them and work on resulting dataframe.",True

@ekaterinadranitsyna5107,2020-02-14T17:18:22Z,1,You also can get the share of developers who know Python by taking the mean of this boolean series where you specify str.contains('Python'). It will divide the sum of True and False by the number of True and False values.,True

We will learn how to answer very interesting questions such as ""What is the most popular social media site by country?"".
