@justgivemethetruth,2018-12-29T19:28:16Z,3,"That is really amazing.  Thanks for posting.  I wish I had stumbled across this much, much earlier.  If you are still around I'd like to ask you a question about this.  I have this idea I've wanted to program for a long time, but I do not have the understanding of the web server internals enough to do it.  That is, to basically intercept certain requests ( perhaps authenticated requests to localhost might be the best way ) and put additional logic into the web server to make it behave like the ""Finder"" on a Mac, but also with local CGI scripts to make it possible to perform user/owner operations.  With a system like this in place the whole desktop might be customized and virtualized across machines, and able for average people to do stuff on their own rather than be the prisoners of MicroSoft and Apple.",True

@weezilla,2018-05-24T05:51:46Z,8,"To potentially save some people frustration: remember this is definitely a ""simple"" webserver. It does not allow things such as serving a local mp3 file within the webpage using <audio src='file.mp3'>. Can cause other (sometimes obscure) 'async' problems too. There are other python std libs you can use that include http threading, but I haven't tried making a terminal one-liner out of them.",True
