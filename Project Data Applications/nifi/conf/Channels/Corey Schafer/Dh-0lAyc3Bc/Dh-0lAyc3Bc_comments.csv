@jermm2183,2022-06-02T22:10:57Z,1,"This is on my PCEP tomorrow I think since I have seen many practice questions with this. I think of it as it simply outputs this when you're adding a number but the loop won't for one iteration, but your video explains it far better than that. Thank you'",True

@mikijasar2594,2021-02-03T21:41:17Z,0,"Please if you have time to help me figure out how to solve this problem. This is essentially a pointless program. Here we have a list of names where the user searches the names in the list. If the name is not in the list it works ok. However, if the name is found, we first get the information that the name was found, but then there is a problem. Namely, the else statement is also executed and if we have two same names in the list then the print statemet of the if block is executed twice and I want it executed only once. How can I handle this. Thank you very much in advance.  # check the names in the list name_list = ['Dani', 'Tom', 'Mark', 'John', 'Mark'] user = input('Which name you are looking for in the list: ')     # if user enter Mark for i in name_list:     if user in i:         print(i) else:     print('There is no such word in the text') _____________________________________________ Which name you are looking for in the list: Mark The name Mark is in the list The name Mark is in the list There is no such word in the text",True

@tatianazihindula8762,2017-12-10T09:58:19Z,0,Tbh the last example is impractical. Instead of braking why not just return i? I bet it would be use to clean up the loop‚Äôs potential mess,True
@sagshah10,2017-07-27T23:22:02Z,9,"Damn, why do i find this now, just wrote a piece of code where this would have been much more efficient, I was forced to use found = False, and then when the loop finds a match I had to do found = True, then break and then write ""if found:  xxx       else: "" ,  this would have been much more easier. Oh well thanks alot, I will be using it in the future, and when I plan to refactor my existing code. Thanks Alot for all the Awesome Tutorials :)",True

@Murphyalex,2015-11-12T14:50:05Z,25,"Your Python videos are great. There is a lot of information on the basics already out there, but you bring down the more complex functionality to a level that is manageable/understandable and doesn't already require you to be a coding buff to utilise or see the value in. It's definitely your niche, which is why I subscribed.",True
@sunwoodad,2015-10-08T23:16:08Z,6,"Why don't we just write like this:  def find_index(to_search, target):     for i, value in enumerate(to_search):         if value == target:             return i     else:         return -1  This result is same.",True
