@MuzzyV29,2017-07-07T16:18:45Z,0,why do you have to assign function (e_sort ) to a a key. Why can't we just assign .name method to key variable to pass all employees ? is it not possible without using anonymous or regular function ?   Also does they Key variable has to be called KEY or is it just convention ?,True
