@lopatasezahrabala,2023-02-08T20:35:02Z,9,"For everyone that has problems with validation from registration, I've found solution ! Flask has changed over the years, currently you need your code like this :  from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField, SubmitField, BooleanField, EmailField, validators  class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):     username = StringField(""Username"", [validators.DataRequired(), validators.Length(min=2, max=15)])     email = EmailField(""Email"", [validators.DataRequired(), validators.Email()])      password = PasswordField(""Password"", [validators.DataRequired(),                                           validators.EqualTo(""confirm_password"", message=""Passwords must match"")])     confirm_password = PasswordField('Repeat Password')     submit = SubmitField(""Sign Up"")  1) you dont need this line "" from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Length, Email, EqualTo "" anymore 2) Flask is doing all the validation currently from validators""dot""something for example validators.DataRequired()... validators.Email()... 3) so after field you put the name, and after comma you do validation like validators.DataRequired() 4) for Email validation, that means that if you write just ""ASD"" into email field and try to send it, it should tell you immediatelly that it's incorrect format of email. For this you need to use EmailField not StringField 5) with this code, there is password validation, that they match, only with this code above there is currently no alerts for that so dont be afraid, that there is no validation.  After this you should be redirected to home page with account created. Hope this helps.",True

I'm pretty much good up until you demonstrate the error output when an empty form is submitted. The bootstrap css kicks in, also I get a small tool-tip that pops up letting me know only the first field is empty. When I dig into the form objects, none of them appear to contain any errors. Digging further into the code I found this assignment under the __call__ function for DataRequired:  if not field.data or isinstance(field.data, string_types) and not field.data.strip():             if self.message is None:                 message = field.gettext('This field is required.')             else:                 message = self.message              field.errors[:] = []  Looks like the errors are being wiped out if the conditional that checks for the lack of data returns true? Upon further inspection there are several flavors of data present validators but they all follow the same strategy. Am I totally over looking something here? Or has the code from wtforms been updated since this video was created? I suspect these are changes to the library but would welcome critical feedback if not. If this in fact library code changes, I'm curious of how you would implement this ""manual control"" design, now that missing data errors are not stored in the field.errors attr?",True

In the flaskblog application we create an instance of the LoginForm and put in some logic. (Corey calles it 'form' , but let's call it more explicitly 'form_login')   Now...what if we had 2, or maybe even 3 forms in the login.html template - How does 'form_login'  know it is linked to the form in the login route?   Does it simply work because we only have 1 form here, ergo ' form_login'  must be linked to the only form in the html?     I can accept that, but then I would still like to know - what if you have more forms on a single page/route?

For example, when we are creating a username we would like to check its length and whether such a un already exists in DB.

@leeritenour,2018-10-15T08:31:09Z,0,"Interesting! It's just five months since this video was created, and the behavior of the validator has changed. When I clicked submit with all the fields being empty, it just notified me the first field is required. The color of the field didn't change, and the alert message was issued by the browser (The latest Chrome).  Then I just input only one character for the username and hit the submit button, and then it said the Email is required. So far the username is still filled with only one character, and it didn't say that's not enough.   Then I input an invalid email address and hit the button again. It passed the email and asked me for the password.  Then I filled out all fields and press submit the form. It finally told me that the username should be between 2 and 20 characters long, and the email address was invalid, with the input border being red.  It seems that the Required() has a higher priority than other validation functions. Only when Required() is fulfilled for all the fields in the form does other validators start to come in.  I have compared your sample code with the one that I typed, and they were almost the same except some empty lines between codes.  I am using version 0.12.2 of Flask. This different behavior may also be caused by the browser. The required-related warning responsibility is always taken over by the browser now.",True
