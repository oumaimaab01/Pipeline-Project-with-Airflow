If you want to execute it, you might want to call outer_func()() but that syntax is illegal, so we set outer_func() to the variable name my_func so we can call my_func() with just one set of parentheses.

Because python has first class functions, The inner functions can be returned as an output of the function. That means remembering the inner function necessitates remembering the free variable that was not defined within defining of inner function. Therefore Python having first calss functions result in it having a closure.   Adding on, they are useful when creating a log file. Yet I do not know what log files are and don't know its purpose. Just guessing, maybe it is a file that developers can use for a program to help keep track of what is going on in their program.",True

Heat seeking, explosive, dimension opening, whatever. In this case, the inner function is like the gun, and the variables that are put into it when the outer function is called is like the ammunition. You are calling for a specific gun already loaded with some kind of ammunition. Or, maybe a better way of putting it is that the outer function adds mods to the base gun, like a specific kind of stock, a sight, a longer magazine, etc. Then when you call the outer function it gives you this modified gun. When you now use that, you put in the ammo, which is the arguments given to the inner function.",True

Since the logger function was called using the brackets ""()"" it was executed and returned the inner function (log_func) because of the return log_func at the end of the logger function.

The inner function had some additional logic for logging information about the application's runtime, and for printing the executed outer function with the inner function's input arguments.
