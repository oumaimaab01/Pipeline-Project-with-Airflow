At about 10:30, you set up the reset form, and have it verify the account and return a ""There is no account with this email"" if the account doesn't exist. This is bad for security; I know we're all learning here, but it's a habit we should all get into as soon as possible. Actually telling the user whether or not an account exists allows for enumeration attacks, and would help someone attempt to steal credentials from a system by allowing them to divine a list of valid account email addresses.  The correct approach is to validate the account, but never say anything. Always return the same canned string, something like ""If an account with this email address exists, a password reset message will be sent shortly."" If the account doesn't exist, just silently exit and do nothing else. This way you close the enumeration attack quickly and easily.  Thanks for this series, I really appreciate it!",True

@abhi9811206369,2018-09-06T07:13:59Z,9,"My question is how do I make this link one time usable? Because right now with one link I can reset the password as many times as I want until the token expires. UPDATE: I made a new class in models.py named Blacklist where I stored all the used tokens. Before changing the password, I checked if the link was in blacklist table. If it was, I didn't allow change of password. Also if the link was invalid, I still checked if the token was in blacklist, as it might mean that the token expired, in which case I simply deleted the token from blacklist table. Simple solution but it works. :)",True

However, the reset link is still valid after clicking on it through email and I can update my password. I can reset it again with the same link. Is this how it suppose to work? Is it not better that once the tokenlink is used it's not valid anymore? Thanks!",True

@elephant742,2018-07-29T05:36:37Z,2,"Hey Corey. Nice video as usual..really good explanation.   I have a small doubt though. So , in your models.py you have created the serializer object that creates token with a default 30 mins timeout. And you are using that token to validate password change requests. So, my question is, where are we storing that token once it is generated? I didn't see you saving it in the database . Does it store it in the  program runtime memory ?  So what happens we have deployed it on production ? Say - www.myfancyblog.com , and I have 1000 users requesting for password change at a time. So does the flask web server store all the 1000 generated tokens in the run time memory space or is it better to store it in the user database ?",True
