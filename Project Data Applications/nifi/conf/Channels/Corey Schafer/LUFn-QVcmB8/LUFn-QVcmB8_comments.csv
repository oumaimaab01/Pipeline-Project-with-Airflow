I am sending an 'email address confirmation'   email to new users. This email contains a link that new users should click on to verify their email address. I am getting the link using url_for('confirm_email', token=token, _external=True). The issue is that the external link I get still uses the address 127.0.0.1:8000 instead of my domain name.
