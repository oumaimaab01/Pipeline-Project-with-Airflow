@tortue34170,2020-12-20T22:23:53Z,5,"Well, I'm following this course from the first video and it's always amazing and so valuable information. Thx Corey ! You are amazing !  Just for the record, I've been checking the flask documentation on login (https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#login-example), and noticed this warning :  Warning: You MUST validate the value of the next parameter. If you do not, your application will be vulnerable to open redirects. For an example implementation of is_safe_url see this Flask Snippet.   The link to the ""spinnet"" is unfortunatly broken and after some research I found this very interesting post on Stackoverflow which gives more information on the issue, and also gives the link to the ressource. I don't understand everything, but I got that this is an important issue (maybe for more experienced users so Corey didn't want to put too much information here). Anyway, it looks like an important security issue, and if someone can give me a feedback on it, it would be very appreciated :) ! I actually have two questions :  - How to implement the ""is_safe_url"" solution ? I'm new in code and don't really understand it.. - Given this comment on the snippet page : ""Please note that redirecting like this is vulnerable to the Open Redirect Vulnerability (http://homakov.blogspot.com/2014/01/evolution-of-open-redirect-vulnerability.html) due to the way that python's urlparse module parses URLs"", which I don't really understand (neither), I was wondering if the ""is_safe_url"" solution is relevant, and if not, how to face this security issue.  Sorry for the endless comment.. Hope this will be useful for others, and hope someone will come with an answer :) ! One more time, you're a rockstar Corey, great job for these videos !",True

@laslok,2019-01-06T17:35:55Z,0,"Dear Mr. Schafer, first I thank you a lot for this excellent tutorial. However the user validation you propose, should not never be used. There are many reasons for this. The database may for example not return anything due to some errors not passed to your API. So, in order to ensure analytical uniqueness an SQL query in the form: [select count(*) from User where [conditions]] has to be used. This query will always return 0 or a positive number. In our case, since we do have two analytically unique attributes: username and email the query should be: [select count(*) from User where username = 'username.data' or email = 'email.data']. In addition the comparison should either be made in lower or upper case. The final result would therefor be similar to: [select count(*) from User where lower(username) = lower('username.data') or lower(email) = lower('email.data')]",True

@mishatet8911,2018-09-10T07:12:59Z,0,Are all these forms validations steps are 'pre-sealed' in Django and save some time for the developer?,True
@h82fail,2018-09-06T20:14:34Z,8,"19:00 I noticed that the validation is case sensitive.  Say Example@email.com vs example@email.com vs EXAMPLE@email.com - it allows you to create them all even though they are all the same address.     Same problem exists for logging in, I dont think it should care about case for the email.  Since its a database query not sure how to solve this without using .lower() on both the creation and query part, would be nice if people can still use uppercase but not create two usernames with the only difference being a uppercase.",True
@ilustrado7291,2018-09-04T17:17:24Z,1,"What a satisfying episode. Thanks Corey! Your content is superb. By the way, is the Django series in the works? Really looking forward to that.",True
@Forlorn.,2018-08-21T00:58:17Z,4,"Hey Corey, thanks so much for the flask tutorial videos, they're incredibly helpful! I'm essentially following your lead to build a template for my site and then I will alter that for my needs. Your example for a blog is very general and should be easy to extend, which is awesome!  I've got an interesting question for you. Let's say that I would like to create a website that would only let someone create an account if they were authorized by me to do so. What would be the best way to accomplish this? Currently I'm imagining creating a long hash key that I would share with the people that requested to sign up. They would need to enter this key in order to successfully create an account. This would involve me manually sharing this password with them though, which seems like it could be a hassle depending on how many people use the website. Thanks again Corey, you're the man! Once I make some money using these newfound skills, you better bet I'll be coming back to give you some appreciation!",True

@bugs389,2018-05-21T19:22:32Z,240,"For anyone wondering how validate_username() and validate_email() are being called, these functions are called with the FlaskForm class that our RegistrationForm class inherited from. If you look at the definition for validate_on_submit(), and from there, the definition for validate(), that validate function contains the following line:  inline = getattr(self.__class__, 'validate_%s' % name, None)  There is a lot going on in the background, but from what I can tell, Flask is checking for extra functions created with the naming pattern: ""validate_(field name)"", and later calling those extra functions. Correct me if I'm wrong.",True
