@konstantinpalkin2177,2021-07-01T20:24:13Z,1,"I hope that since video has been recorded you finally realized that Ctrl+U and Ctrl+K are NOT delete. As well as Ctrl+W and Meta+D. (Oh, sadly not a single word about Meta key). And if you know that now you should feel the power of Ctrl+Y combination. There is also very useful Ctrl+T for those like me who type words incroretcly.",True

@justray510,2021-04-06T10:51:44Z,1,"good video and very helpful. I didn't know that about history or the key shortcut. Too bad they would confuse the hell out of me bc I use MacVim. I found a script years ago that will list the history so I can type a number of the command to execute, sounds similar. Typing 'history' will show all of your past history where the script I use displays 30 (or a number u like) of past commands. I tried to find it a few months ago but couldn't. I probably should read the bash man page more often. Can I post it here?",True

@dragonfly-7,2018-06-01T08:22:32Z,3,"Corey, I spent some time on watching your videos and you are doing just great work ! I now know to whom/what to refer to when asked by newbies for helpful resources. Awesome ! Thanks !  One comment on the keyboard shortcut section though: Almost all keyboard shortcuts of the BASH are heavily influenced by corresponding EMACS shortcuts. This might be something which could be mentioned in this context (although it might frighten VI/VIM-centric people ... ;-) )  My very personal explanation for this is that both EMACS and BASH are GNU projects ...",True
