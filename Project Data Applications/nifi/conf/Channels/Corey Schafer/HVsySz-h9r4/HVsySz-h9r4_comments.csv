Am learning on my own and i depend so much on videos on YouTube cuz they help me to learn but that's no the issue...

@RicardoPenders,2022-12-18T08:36:07Z,0,"Man I have done pretty much everything but I keep getting the same error when I want to push to my remote repository, what I see that's different is that the URL you're using do have a filename.git at the end, but I have created an empty repository on GitHub without that filename.git file so I do have the correct URL to my GitHub repository just without the filename.git at the end of the URL and I'm not sure if that's the problem that I can't get to authenticate from within Git CLI.  So when I type the push command I see the following: git push -u origin master git: 'credential-git-credential-manager' is not a git command. See 'git --help'. git: 'credential-git-credential-manager' is not a git command. See 'git --help'. remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication. fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/soharddbwarez/MyArduinoProjects/'  I also get two popup messages in Windows asking me to provide my name on GitHub which is as you can see above soharddbwarez and it asks for my password that I then provide which is as far as I know the GitHub login password, if that's not the case I also created a fine-grained personal access token that I tried for the password but it always gives me the same error message so I'm very stuck now since I don't have an answer to this issue and the help page provided doesn't give an answer either.  Can you please help me or point me in the right direction where I can read how I can fix my particular issue because I'm lost and kinda overwhelmed with information that doesn't give me any answer to fix my issue and I'm running around in circles online if you know what I mean, that's not fun at all and costing me too much time so I have to make a choice to either waste another day on this or move on doing something else that does work and is more fun to do, that's an easy choice for me to make so I have to put this project on hold until I have an answer.  I really hope you can point me in the right direction man so my hope is in your hands right now since I'm not getting any answer from other people I asked online.

@digitalambience6993,2021-06-22T02:43:33Z,0,"For those confused on what the heck is going on with the .gitignore file: - the .gitignore file is a hidden file. This is why when listing (using ls) we have to include the -a flag or -la to show the long-form list of all files - visible and hidden. (Same applies to the .git directory) - When you navigate to the actual folder/directory in Finder (or whatever the equivanlent is on PC) where this .gitignore file is stored, you wont see it unless you press Shift + Command + . (<-- note the period). This key command reveals these hidden files in the Finder window and you will see that .gitignore file. Then you can open it and add the file names of the files you want git to ignore. To do this literally just type the names of the files with their extensions into this document and save. If you want you can hide the hidden files again within the Finder window by pressing Shift + Command + . once more. - After doing this it will work just as it does in the vid.  - Also if you want to remove files from the .gitignore just open the .gitignore file and, that's right, you guessed it, delete the names of those files and save. Now those files will be available once again in the working directory and visible when you run the git status command.  Hope this helps!",True

However I am having trouble when it comes time to clone a remote repository. Corey, in his example, clones the remote repository 'Git-Basics/remote_repo.git' into the directory 'Git-Basics/Clonedrepo'. Did he initialize the remote_repo.git in the directory Git-Basics?   I initialized a git repository within a directory called 'Localrepo'. The path to this .git directory is  'Users/myUsername/desktop/Gitbasics/Localrepo/.git '. I then mad a second directory within Gitbasics called Clonedrepo. I 'cd'd' to the directory 'Clonedrepo and issued the git command : git clone ../Localrepo/.git. Following Corey up to the point in the tutorial where we push added changes to the remote repository, I get the error that updating the current branch in a non-bare repository is denied.   How did Corey make remote_repo.git? I notice that when he lists all his files in his directory Git-Basics, remote_repo.git is listed. Does this mean if he were using OSMac like me, that there would be an image of a folder icon in the Finder window of directory: Git-Basics?",True

@CrippleX89,2020-04-17T01:43:25Z,0,"I agree that at some point it will be important to know how to work with git command line *however* I strongly disagree that learning git CLI should be the first step into git. When you first start learning about git, it's very important to get to know the very basics: what's staging, what's a commit, what are branches, merging and rebasing (I know rebasing is frowned upon by some, but you should at least know what it is, right?), what do fetch, pull and push conceptually do? All that kind of good stuff; and the GUI tools that are available can really help to visualize what's going on and what impact your actions have. Without visualization, it's much harder to see what you're doing. Only when you really understand the concepts of git, the GUI tools might start to limit you. However, even that should not stop you from using the GUI tools; at this point you should ask yourself which you personally prefer: GUI or CLI.  I like to mix both: use GUI for the basic tasks and CLI only when I need to do things that the GUI tools that I use don't offer. GUI tools that I would recommend is of course Source Tree because it's free of charge and Fork (fork.dev) because it's a much cleaner UI and less annoying in terms of workflow but does cost some money after the free trial.",True

@miguelpetrarca5540,2019-08-25T15:09:20Z,0,is there a need to track and commit the .gitignore file? the repo seems to know to ignore the files in .gitignore even without tracking and commiting .gitignore. if we want to end up sharing our .gitignore or having the group of devs havong the same .gitignore then it makes sense to track it so we can get it to the remote repo. but what about otherwise,True

Corey uses the simplest possible examples at every step, has code ready to change, makes the simplest possible changes, explains everything he is doing, often before he does it and again after he does it.  He does not race through everything, hoping to show us how fast or easy some system is or how clever he is.  It's so clear, I was able to deduce some properties of git that he didn't even tackle in his exposition.  I absolutely agree with Adrian Wilk:  Go through the entire video even if you plan to work with git only locally.  No matter what you're doing, take the time to study every video CS makes that has any bearing on your goals.  NOBODY DOES IT BETTER.  Theres no FOO or BAR here.  Instead he names the remote repository ""origin"" to clarify git's checkout and push commands, showing file changes at every step with appropriate commands.  Most of the explanatory video on the web is too basic for me now.  Why?  BECAUSE OF COREY SHAFER.  Good morning Corey!

(e.g using the local-repo as the origin) why didnt you create a remote from the local-repo which you were working from? why introduce another directory into the mix? you didnt explain the difference between a clone and a bare repository and a normal repository. - would be helpful   What i want is to have files in a repository. setup a remote which i can push to.

I kept creating a directory without initializing it and getting an error.  Stupid mistake, but I can't be the only one who over looked that step!",True

@cesoffice,2017-03-06T14:03:26Z,0,"Nice tutorial... GIT is truly amazing. It has transformed the industry and made it necessary to hire more people to do the same amount of work. Configuration Management doesn't have to be so complex, but free tools like this have prevailed. So many commands to conduct simple CM tasks. I really do love it. It keeps more of us employed. I can't imagine if we actually used something simple and efficient again. We would require fewer engineers and in small companies and groups you could do away wit the CM person who I see pulling their hair out all the time with GIT command line.¬† The pendulum always swings too far as we all realize that tools like Clearcase are too expensive and complex, only to skip every compromise and we end up with Free but never easy.",True

@vinay1285,2016-04-26T18:53:41Z,0,"Nice presentation and was very clear. Great job Corey! Quick question i have is, when we do ""git branch calc-divide"" it created a branch on the local repo and you are pushing changes to the remote repo using ""git push -u origin cal-divide"". But there is no branch called ""calc-divide"" on the master right? would it throw any error? Sorry for the dumb question but i'm new to GIT. Thanks!",True
