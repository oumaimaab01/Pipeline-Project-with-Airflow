I am going to go check out the Django series next so I can see what it has to offer.,True

Thought I've watched only till the ""Forms"" video, I can say that your tutorial is 'top shelf' stuff, just like those Schafer Chardonnays. Yup! Oaky, full bodied Schafer Chardonnay is one of favourites. And your videos are  power-packed, non-stop encyclopedia of respective coding. What I like about your videos are: 1. Your teaching methodology is clear and crisp and at the same time, just to the point. For example, in Part 1, you've clearly gone through the evolution of how to run the program on python; from setting the environment variables on command prompt to how to avoid <ctrl + c> procedure. 2. Audio and vidoe qualities are fantastic.  3. Particulary, I would like to underline that you've avoided any extra graphics, music et al. And actually, your voice sounds like music to the ears. Yup! When you decode the the coding, line by line and block by block, we can easily understand the logic behind the coding. Overall, a great effort and an great result! Thanks BK",True

Do you have/recommend/would be interested in making one  tutorial talking about user access control in Python/Flask? i.g: Let's say we have an application with 4 menus Users, Reports, Salaries, Contracts, and we have an Admin that has access to perform CRUD to all menus, a Lawyer that can only access the ""Contracts"" menu and perform CRUD there, and finally a ""Lawyer-Assistant"" that can only access the ""Contracts"" menu but cannot delete any contracts. To give these access to users an Admin would select the user under ""User"" menu and go to let's say ""Permissions"" where there would be a list of all menus (with check boxes) in the system.... Hope I could express myself. If you could at least talk about the concepts involved into something like this in a video I would be already be grateful. Thanks a lot :D",True

Client1 (Filter: Prod1 (quantity1) and Prod2(quantity2) Client2 (Filter: Prod2 (quantity2), Prod4(quantity4),  and Prod7(quantity7) Admin should be able to adapt the prize and quanity for every client And so on • These rights are given for the limited amount of time, and client should be able to put his choice in the basket, see the total and individual costs/ and can see the approximated freight cost/ and finalise the order. • Client can see various photos of the product • Client should be able to zoom in the photo (downloadable protected) • Client can choose to pay online / or pay later/ or pay by cheque/ or on delivery etc Retail client can see the products and quantity directly on the website/ line any other ecommerce site, he can choose/ pay and finalize So the admin has to manage different godowns of stocks • Godown1: for retail clients • Godown2: for wholesale clients • Godown3: virtual godwn created depending upon the filters. Content Type The content is mainly the photos of product, there are high quality photos , size form 2M to 4M  Storage The Phots can be stored on Google Photos/ or any other platform Platforms The site should be compatible with  • windows/mac/linux • PC/tablet/Phones (iphone/android/windows Phone) • Almost all the know browsers (Safari/Chrome/Edge/Mozzarella etc)  Content Language French/ English…to start with  Note: this is the first (not final) version of the requirements.   Question: So since I am new to webdesing, I have no clue where to start from.

I'm not an expert in HTML, so I'd like to ask: When is the form validation done? Since the ""register"" route handles both the initial GET and the subsequent POST, I wonder whether the validation was done at the end of the GET, right before the submission, or at the beginning of POST after the same route caught the POSTed form data. I tried to print the POST body to the console by adding `print(request.get_data())` in front of `form = RegistrationForm()`, and tried a registration with an invalid email. It seems the invalid form content was posted without error attributes. So I was convinced that validation is done in the subsequent POST routes by `form = RegistrationForm()`. (I located that this line consumed the POST data because if I move the `print(request.get_data())` function after this line, I always got empty string printed on the console.) So the form constructor must have access to the request object, which is weird for me because request should live only in the route function, and if I didn't pass it to the constructor as an argument, how can it access the request object?",True
