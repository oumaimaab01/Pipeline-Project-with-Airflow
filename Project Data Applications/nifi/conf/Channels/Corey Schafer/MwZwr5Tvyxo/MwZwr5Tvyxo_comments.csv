Thought I've watched only till the ""Forms"" video, I can say that your tutorial is 'top shelf' stuff, just like those Schafer Chardonnays. Yup! Oaky, full bodied Schafer Chardonnay is one of favourites. And your videos are  power-packed, non-stop encyclopedia of respective coding. What I like about your videos are: 1. Your teaching methodology is clear and crisp and at the same time, just to the point. For example, in Part 1, you've clearly gone through the evolution of how to run the program on python; from setting the environment variables on command prompt to how to avoid <ctrl + c> procedure. 2. Audio and vidoe qualities are fantastic.  3. Particulary, I would like to underline that you've avoided any extra graphics, music et al. And actually, your voice sounds like music to the ears. Yup! When you decode the the coding, line by line and block by block, we can easily understand the logic behind the coding. Overall, a great effort and an great result! Thanks BK",True

Do you have/recommend/would be interested in making one  tutorial talking about user access control in Python/Flask? i.g: Let's say we have an application with 4 menus Users, Reports, Salaries, Contracts, and we have an Admin that has access to perform CRUD to all menus, a Lawyer that can only access the ""Contracts"" menu and perform CRUD there, and finally a ""Lawyer-Assistant"" that can only access the ""Contracts"" menu but cannot delete any contracts. To give these access to users an Admin would select the user under ""User"" menu and go to let's say ""Permissions"" where there would be a list of all menus (with check boxes) in the system....

@yltfy,2019-05-11T04:42:40Z,0,"Great video! Thanks very much! One thing I'm curious is what happened behind the scene of the form. I'm not an expert in HTML, so I'd like to ask: When is the form validation done? Since the ""register"" route handles both the initial GET and the subsequent POST, I wonder whether the validation was done at the end of the GET, right before the submission, or at the beginning of POST after the same route caught the POSTed form data. I tried to print the POST body to the console by adding `print(request.get_data())` in front of `form = RegistrationForm()`, and tried a registration with an invalid email. It seems the invalid form content was posted without error attributes. So I was convinced that validation is done in the subsequent POST routes by `form = RegistrationForm()`. (I located that this line consumed the POST data because if I move the `print(request.get_data())` function after this line, I always got empty string printed on the console.) So the form constructor must have access to the request object, which is weird for me because request should live only in the route function, and if I didn't pass it to the constructor as an argument, how can it access the request object?",True
