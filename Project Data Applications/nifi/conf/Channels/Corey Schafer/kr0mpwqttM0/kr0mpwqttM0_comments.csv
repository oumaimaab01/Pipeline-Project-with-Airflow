@john_hind,2021-12-08T22:22:40Z,0,"Having recently come to Python from Lua, your videos have been very useful. However I do not agree that Python functions can be described as 'first class'. If they were, the hobbled 'lambda' version would be redundant and you would be able to write a full function definition anywhere a function reference is legal. For example, you should be able to make a list of functions by nesting function definitions within a list constructor. When a language has truly first class functions (like Lua does) a function definition is syntactically a constructor for anonymous function objects in exactly the same way a string or number literal, or a tuple constructor is for those object types.",True

That means that it can be an input and output for another function, and stored as an variable.    Those functions that inputs and outputs another function is called a higher class function.

However, I think it's important to make it clear that the examples you're giving are just intended to illustrate the concepts of first-class/higher-order functions, etc., and that the same results can be achieved in a more simple and/or readable way:    Examples 1 & 2:    def exp_list(exp, lst):     exped = [i ** exp for i in lst]     return exped   print(exp_list(2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # outputs [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] print(exp_list(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # outputs [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]   Example 4:   def wrap_text(tag, txt):     print(f""<{tag}>{txt}</{tag}>"")   wrap_text(""h1"", ""This is a headline"") # outputs <h1>This is a headline</h1> wrap_text(""p"", ""This is a paragraph"") # outputs <p>This is a paragraph</p>",True

I followed the video and when I created logger:  def logger(msg):      def log_message():         print('Log:',msg)      return log_message  log_hi = logger('Hi!') log_hi()  I got this output:  ('Log:', 'Hi!')  I'm running ATOM 1.31 with ATOM RUNNER to execute code. Is this a settings problem or something?   Thanks!",True

@Veronica-bd9fq,2017-01-17T02:02:59Z,0,Seems over complicated for no reason  :/ 2:00 that seems better. Typescript is getting popular because this is madness?,True
@amanikac,2016-12-13T10:49:32Z,0,"Corey is it possible to send multiple args to a function. For example instead of cube lets say area which takes length and breadth as their arguments. Just followed the video, however ended up assigning the values for both length and breadth to ""length only""",True
@babacarguisse4497,2016-12-10T20:07:12Z,0,"Corey - shouldn't the javascript for loop iterate through the values in the array vs. 1->args_list.length? I guess what I'm trying to say is the code you show works if the array always starts with and increments by 1, but not otherwise. Am I right?",True
@DeepMindstorm,2016-11-13T17:26:19Z,16,you're freaking awesome thanks,True
@PacketCyclotron,2016-11-05T01:04:08Z,0,"I'm new at this, please bare with me.  When you define a closure, variables on the inner function are remembered because there is still a reference to it.   How does garbage collection work.  If you no longer need your ""manufactured"" function, how can you get rid of it without terminating your whole program?  Would this work: print_h1=None?",True
@arkates3625,2016-11-01T16:00:29Z,1,"Correct me if im wrong, but is the reason for using functions in other functions to easily create new functions? Example: def wrapwithsymbol(symbol):     def wraptext(text) :         print(""{0}\n{1}\n{0}"".format(symbol * len(text), text))          return wraptext   So what we can do now is easily create functions like: wrap_equal = wrapwithsynbol(""="") wrap_equal(""great video btw"") >>> =============== great video btw =============== So what I want to know is if this is the right way of using them and if it is, is it the only scenario when you want to use them?",True
@leopardbasement2915,2016-10-30T11:59:49Z,0,"Thanks, great explanation. Just one thing that puzzled me at around 6:30, in your JavaScript my_map function, shouldn't the 'i' be used as an index for the arg_list array rather than being passed directly to the func(i)?",True

@SinCityGT3,2016-09-02T15:24:11Z,0,"Would you recommend staying away from these with python for the most part? Since, as you said, they can get real confusing fast. I'm pretty new to python and still trying to learn how things should be done in the real world. It'd be great if you could include in more of your videos where you typically use certain things. I'm especially mixed up on when to use classes. I've read some articles that act like they should be used all the time, and others that say to almost never use them.",True

@piotrkmiecik5546,2016-08-18T12:30:05Z,4,"Thanks for the tutorial, it's realy help me but I think there is one bugs when you show passing function as an argument. In Python example you are using foreach loop but in js example you are using normal loop and you are not working on elements from passed array but on the loop's indexes:          result.push( func(arg_list[i]) );                       But it's just a detail :)",True
