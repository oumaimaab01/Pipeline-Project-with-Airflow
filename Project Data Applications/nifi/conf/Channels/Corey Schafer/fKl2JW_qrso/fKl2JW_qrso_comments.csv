@lakeguy65616,2023-09-23T21:05:04Z,0,"I have 38 files that I pass through a function. Each file takes 1-2 minutes to finish. I'm using a core i5 laptop with 4 CPU cores. I've re-written to take advantage of multiprocessing. Now, all 38 files are finished in less than 20 minutes. That's the good news.  The bad is that it maxes out my pc to 100% of the CPU when running.  I had expected it to start 1 file per CPU core and finish that file before starting the next. (Its looping through the directory). But in reality, it seems to start all 38 files. It seems to process a little of each until finished. The time stamp on the files indicates almost all were created within the same minute.  My question is this: can I force Python to finish a file before starting the next?  (each file is processed on a different CPU core...)  If this possible, what is it called? I mean, how do I research it?    Thank you  JD",True
@tutobab,2023-09-14T10:45:48Z,0,"time.sleep(seconds) - is a bad example to explain multiprocessing, as long as it behaves just like IO-bound. So we would not see any difference in performance between threading and multiprocessing modules. Instead of using sleep - use some random math calculations in a loop of, dunno, 5_000_000 iterations. In this case we are running 100% CPU-bound operations and in this case, threading will perform way more slower than multiprocessing. That's the only inaccuracy which i found by watching the video.

So it can processing the image in a separately managed thread in C and relinquish execution to the python interpreter to process python bytecode on other python threads. So it's essentially a bad example, because at the low-level it behaves like multiprocessing in the sense that it can run things outside the python interpreter (multiprocessing does that in a separate process, PIL does that in a private thread, in C). So your assessment that the workload is I/O bound is incorrect. It is mostly CPU bound, but the processing you chose released the GIL, that's an unfortunate choice.",True

I'm trying to initialize some variables in parallel using multiprocessing, but it generates a msg saying that the ConcreteModel object has no attribute 'x'.

A helpful addition would be to add how to interrupt an ongoing process/thread in those cases where you need to run something continuously and only shutdown when the main program is terminated (perhaps by the user).",True

@9SMTM6,2019-09-24T18:34:02Z,8,"The reason it finished the 1s future in the Multiprocessing part after the 2 and (just after) the 3s future is that the PoolExecutor limited the threads to 4 (you said yourself that it chooses the number of concurrent threads based i.e. your hardware). And your list of times to wait is reversed in duration. So it only started the future for the 1s duration AFTER the first future finished, the one with a duration of 2s. So the 1s future finished after 2+1= 3s plus overhead, so slightly after the 3s future.  Edit: Aaand you realized that just shortly after. Was wondering why noone else wrote this before.",True

How do you keep multiple threads or processes from grabbing the same '5' off your list, for example? Are you relying on map() or the for loop to handle that for you? If so, then why do we need locks at all? And you didn't use pop() either. Or why not make the producer of the shared resource a generator? At least where the shared resource is iterable?
