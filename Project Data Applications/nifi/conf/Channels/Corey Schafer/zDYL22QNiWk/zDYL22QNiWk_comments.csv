I am using 3.12.1 python version and want to change Python version in pipfile to 3.11 and trying to make my virtual environment use the specified version using pipenv --python 3.11.

The cursor/prompt is just waiting for another command. I checked current version of python in virtual environment, it's still 3.12.1. Nothing has changed. Thanks in advance",True

I understand if i do that it will be much simpler to read, but on the other hand, if i want to compile the hole project, it would make me a hard time.   So what do you think?
