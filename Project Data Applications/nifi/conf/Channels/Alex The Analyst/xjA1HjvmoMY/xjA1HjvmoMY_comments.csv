@LavanyaGopal-py6jd,2024-04-19T22:42:58Z,0,"Hello, thank you so much for this wonderful tutorial. However, I have one doubt that needs clarifying. So I tried this code out with the same set of codes and Url you have used but there seems to be a problem in this line -> print(Soup.find_all('p',class_=""lead"")). the output for this line shows [ ] .. which isn't the paragraph from the website. How do I rectify this problem? also, I use IDLE for Python. Once again your videos are awesome and I hope you continue making more great coding content.",True

@user-ys3td1mt3b,2023-12-14T03:05:13Z,1,I am pretty new to data analysis and I was working on a project where I would need to scrape data from a website and this tutorial has been so helpful! I spent hours trying to figure it out and the other tutorials on Youtube don't explain anything or skip steps and so it's hard to learn and personalize it for your own project. This however was detailed and straight to the point! Thank you so much. You're a lifesaver!,True
