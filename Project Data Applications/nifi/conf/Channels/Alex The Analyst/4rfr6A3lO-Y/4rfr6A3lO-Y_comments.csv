I kind of understand the basic concepts, but I'm not sure if I really understand it enough to put them on my resume...

@kelelo1488,2021-04-28T15:25:07Z,0,"Hey Alex, so Iâ€™ve done SAS (in a core module from my degree) which has a lot of similarities with SQL. Do you reckon it would still be useful to send examples of my code even if they donâ€™t ask for SAS as into many companies use it?",True
@ofeliiabagratian5748,2021-04-05T17:11:10Z,1,"Hello Alex, do you think that sending a document with a script is better than giving a link to GitHub/Portfolio in the Resume? This is the first time I see someone sending actual code with the resume, it's cool, but if I would get something like that, my first question would be ""why the person doesn't just give a link to GitHub""...",True

@paulaa6373,2020-11-30T03:15:53Z,1,Great video! I have a question though. I am from the humanities (currently working on a History PhD). Have you met analysts with PhDs in unrelated fields like mine (considering they have managed to learn the necessary skills for the job)? Thanks!,True

@icemorejewellery479,2020-11-06T13:33:03Z,2,"Hi Alex,  I was wondering your thoughts on including queries you wrote on your current companies database in your application? Is this exposing potentially sensitive information even if you do not show the query results (just the code)? Thanks",True

I have been searching the web on Data analyst resume but did not see anything useful or I could relate to.  But this video says everything in under 8 minutes. Thank you so much.  Another thing is the resume is very simple, short and straight to the point.",True

@notoriousft,2020-08-15T07:48:51Z,3,Thanks for the video. You might want to double check the most recent experience part where you mistakenly listed C+ as a language (I think you meant C++).,True

@datalab365,2020-02-13T13:31:53Z,1,Where is the template?,True
@therandomdot2563,2020-02-04T21:25:57Z,5,"The code example was good. I include links to articles I've written on analytics + my github. I don't think anyone clicks on them. Having the code physically in their face as an appendix to the resume seems like a better idea. Issue I'm finding in getting data analyst jobs is companies want someone results-oriented, but the HR filter is hard to bypass when HR asks for a bunch of software / tool skills. I've solved million-dollar problems at companies via analytics, I have an MS in IS, but I don't have 5 yrs experience in SAS, R, etc.. so, don't get calls. It feels humiliating.",True
@Stefan-xi6lk,2020-02-03T15:13:41Z,1,Could you share the link to the template used?,True
