@Hotdads1,2022-12-17T17:19:02Z,0,"I know I‚Äôm commenting on this a year later but you were wrong about the travel industry specifically regarding short term rentals like Airbnb and VRBO. What happened in regards to travel was people were flying less which means destination vacations like Hawaii or flying across the country were showing a major slow down. Instead, people started looking for great areas that they could drive to and at a reasonable distance. Drive to destinations like The Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, Destin Florida, and Miramar beach and Joshua Tree absolutely exploded. Owners of rentals were seeing the highest rates they‚Äôve ever been able to charge because people just wanted to get away and a lot of the travelers were using their COVID checks to pay for these vacations. That and the increase in remote work allowed people to work and also visit a place they‚Äôve never been to before. Just an observation and as always I love the content and you have inspired me to change my career trajectory to Data Analytics. Once I get a job I‚Äôll donate 1/4 of my first paycheck to you as a massive thank you for the free content you have provided!",True
