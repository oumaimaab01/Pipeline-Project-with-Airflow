@TravisSmith-jb8wr,2023-11-27T11:19:53Z,1,His list is pretty good as I have taken most of these.  Jose is number 1 for Python.  Colt wasn’t that good as he has trouble staying focused and 100 days of code was the worst course.  If you can’t learn with Jose zero to hero you won’t learn anywhere else.    Udemy is much better than Coursera which I wasting 4 to 5 months and didn’t learn or retain much.  Udemy got me understanding python and sql within 3 weeks.  By month 2. I was completely comfortable with the basics and some advanced coding,True
