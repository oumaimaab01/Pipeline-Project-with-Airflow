Not having others in close proximity that I can get help from or worth together on a problem with would be another problem for me.  There are a lot of ways to communicate with co-workers thanks to modern technologies, but it's not quite a replacement to having someone physically nearby.  I'm also not sure I can focus as well if I'm at home.  I'd actually have to try it to be able to know, but those are my immediate concerns.  Not having to commute sounds heavenly though.",True

@michaelmccoubrey4211,2022-03-29T11:46:06Z,2,"If you're new to your industry it can take a frustratingly long time to learn about your job, as there is less interaction with colleagues. I'd advise working in person at first then work from home. That being said a lot of people are not in the office anymore so you'll get less interaction regardless.",True

@Vikram_8621,2022-03-29T11:13:50Z,7,"Bok Choy! üòÅTo the point Alex! since 2016 I have been working remotely for which I used to be called abnormal by the recruiters trust me it is the best thing that happened to me. I am more productive, focusing on my development, no OFFICE POLITICS! Plus taking care of my old parents. I think working in office consumes you at one point of time, whereas remote working exposes you to a larger world of opportunities at a Global scale. I never ever thought I would learn so many things working remotely that I would never have ever working in physical office. Keep up the Good Work, you content is real, to the point.",True
