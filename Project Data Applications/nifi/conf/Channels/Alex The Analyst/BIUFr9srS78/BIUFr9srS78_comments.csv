@CrissyUnfiltered,2022-12-12T05:08:13Z,0,"Amazing content Alex! I never thought of data analytics until I started my own YT channel. When I was younger I knew I always wanted to have a career “helping people”. I always looked at healthcare so that’s exactly what I did, I went into nursing and became a nurse. I have always been a curious person searching for the why behind everything. I love being a nurse but I feel that it is time for a change.   When I created my travel channel I just really enjoyed creating content, editing, creating scripts, monitoring the performance, etc. I started to research how to get into tech and started learning SQL not realizing I used similar skills before.  After days of research I’ve become even more interested in creating projects based on data. Recently started the google data analyst cert and I’m loving it so far.   There is so much to learn and I’m still not sure how to even begin with tailoring my resume for a career change. I will continue to watch your channel because you seem very transparent and the info is very helpful.   Thank you so much! I’m looking to learn so much more from you! 😊",True

@superwormy1119,2022-03-23T17:03:05Z,0,"Hi Alex, you really are an inspiration. My cliff notes story is I had a kid young and never finished my bachelors but over time was able to at least finish my associates ( all though it is a complete mess of courses with no focus) I got a job about 10 years ago that was in a B2B call center. Small company. A couple years in I was helping with a project and the owner liked my excel skills and I was able to move into a position that cleaned, prepped and loaded data for projects. Over time I learned little things here and there with sql, some Marcos in excel to help automate some reports I did. I had a report that took hours I got down to about 15 minutes . 🙃  So I have just been there since but I am trying to grow my skills because I feel like I just know small pieces of a bunch of different things. I have just felt stuck for the last few years. Your story inspires me to push and just dedicate the time to learn and do projects and make a portfolio. Because in the end, no one can take away your knowledge. And knowledge is power and opportunity.  Great video!",True

I'd like to ask you (and everybody else who could help), some suggestions regarding how to move: Goals: - Work as Data Analyst (and maybe going on to something more Data science related, but that's to be thought) - Work remotely (I don't have any particular wish concerning the country. Remote cause I wanna move on an island :D ) - gettin paid more compared to now (who wouldn't :D)  My Background: - I'm 32yo, even if I don't have it written on my resume and people think I'm 8year younger  :D - 4y experience as Business Analyst (doing Functional analysis an testing) in banking field - knowledge of Excel, SQL and basics of Python, Tableau, ETL processes - Bachelor degree in Economics where I got enough quantitative knowledge (especially Stats) - Attended the Google Data Analytics 6 months course  - languages: proficiency in Eng, Italian native, some French and German, too.   Thoughts: I've tried some courses, in a way or in another, and I think that I'm tired to attend anything in which I always have to do the same basic things, since I think they won't get me anywhere.  I wonder if I should attend something that's more 'seriours' and tough, rather than a simple course...but still, what and taught by who?  It's then ok for me to pay 20/40€ a month for a course, even 1000/2000€ for a full course, but only if it really gives me a good boost.  Maybe I should gather self-taught experience workiung on Kaggle datasets and then try to apply to a newbie job, even part-time.  What would you think about getting into a low exp part-time job? Do you think I could ever be chosen?   Anything I would do now, is something I woulds start to do part-time, since still got a full-time job, even if I got plenty of spare-time because I'm not always full of tasks and I work remotely.   Then, would it have any sense to think to go on into Data science or would it take too much time wo master  I know it can seem pretty confusionary, but, working with data is something I truely prefer over Functional stuff but, since I had to start working, I took what the market offered me back then :).
