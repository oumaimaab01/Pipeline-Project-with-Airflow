@ChrisTian-uw9tq,2023-05-11T08:54:47Z,0,"Pretty much aligned with not just how but also why I use gpt. In a relatively short space of time, I replaced what I used to do with SQL and Excel with Python generated with gpt (no prior python or coding experience). Just like you showed in this example, just that in the end, I made Python files and global functions to run what I ran with the first few data sets I explored. Getting this phase of ETL so quickly implemented, brings the more fun and brain taxing part of working with the resulting data up front in no time at all. Which brings me space and time to keep going with gpt to implement more code to do tasks I need done, formulating them dynamically as I go so they can be reused, which leads me to think that a web based browser is on the horizon, to run my functions based on user inputs instead of me via an IDE. Which of course, one can use gpt for again to try out, build, refactor. In effect, I am building a tool for myself to replace a lot of what I usually find I need to do, just to get me somewhere where the real work of solution building begins, but with a tool box of data exploded from source data. And it seems no sign at all ahead, of what gpt and python can't help me with. It just today advised that for the next step of my actions (formulating structured data points from unstructured comment fields) that with Python I can utilize X, Y, Z libraries in A, B, C steps to approach my task. What is stunning is that you can ask gpt to do a task for you, like write some sql code - but you can then ask it to give you the python code it used to output the sql code to me, so that I can make a function and not have to come back to gpt again for the same ask. I don't give gpt any data - just tasks and examples. It would be fantastic to have a gpt on my local machine, with access to UI commands like I do, through keyboard and mouse referencing - to action these actions, to save files, write files, run queries... I don't really like the idea that any of my true code and data and use case, is sent to OpenAI however - for sure they must have an gpt like model reviewing all user inputs and gpt outputs and clustering on content and use per user interaction with gpt, anything we share is somehow also in their awareness and so customer data, is a no no to use on the platform but also I am concerned how long we will have free access to what we currently have access to. OpenAI know what I use gpt for, whats to say it sees that so many of us are doing similar that they don't pursue the +plus model for coding specific and thats then accessible only through paying... Its a fantastic tool, just the future looks very foggy to me as to where and how this will go.",True

@paulwatts1704,2023-05-02T21:50:38Z,4,I spent 35 yrs working in big data analytics at one of the credit bureaus - started out on mini computers and moved to the very first pc's so I have literally seen it all. I spent the last 3 months playing with GTP4 on a couple of private big data projects and in conjunction with an ETL tool (like alteryx) I can do in half a day what it took a small team of phd stats 3 months just 15 yrs ago. GPT is extremely impressive in generating code but equally impressive in suggesting methods.  Without doubt GPT and it like are going to radically change data analysis and probably allow the more creative folks to win out over the less creative. It will mean fewer programmers and data engineers for sure. If I were 22 again I would make sure I had the widest possible understanding of  business processes / problems and a wide range of analytical methods at a theoretical level.

@monalisahota,2023-04-06T13:41:20Z,0,"As a new R programmer, I turned to chat gpt 4, the latest one, to get unstuck several times. I had a very similar experience. I was totally blown away by how quickly it understood my dataset with just one code. But I was equally blown away by it's shortcomings in doing simple things such as it kept giving me the same wrong code over and over even after I told it that the code isn't working and why. It went in a loop. But it always tries to please by apologizing even when I am wrong 😅. It's fun to work with CharGPT but it's important to understand it's limitations.  One time, it generated a super complicated code for a very simple task, which even as a beginner, I could see. So I was able to get the results with a simple code and went ahead told CharGPT. It's response was like 'its great you found a simpler solutions. please share your code with me so that I can update my system' or something similar. So I ended up teaching my new friend a thing or two 😅.  With coding, we can always see where the AI is wrong right away as we won't get the results but for general knowledge stuff, it's better to double check from other sources before committing to the info given by CharGPT. It's never said that it doesn't know something or is unsure of something even when it's wrong. Try asking ""why do you make so many silly mistakes?"" for a fun answer (unless it generates less amusing answers for some people😅).
