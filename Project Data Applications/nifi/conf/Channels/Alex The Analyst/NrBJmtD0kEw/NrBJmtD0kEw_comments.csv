@justmedidi,2023-08-30T13:14:15Z,1,"ok. so immediately after creating my stored procedure, i ran into the problem of it not being in the right database even though i did everything correctly and without syntax errors. if you also have this problem, i'm writing this comment to (hopefully) help. sorry, it'll be a long read. so! like i said my stored procedure was not in my SQL Tutorial database as intended and after some searching through my own files still nothing. i read a comment saying that someone found their stored procedure in the master database, so i checked in there and there it was! so if you haven't been able to locate your own, yours may be there. after locating it, i looked up how to move the stored procedure to the right database and the steps i followed are here with my notes in brackets:  1. Go the server in Management Studio 2. Select the database, right click on it Go to Task. 3. Select generate scripts option under Task 4. and once its started select the desired stored procedures you want to copy [for this step i chose to just open the script in a new query window so i didn't have to download a file and work more quickly, but choose the method that is best for you)   now once you have the script of the stored procedure pulled up, look to the very top at (what i guess to be) the USE statement. the database in which the stored procedure is in will be in brackets. go to the USE and change the name of the database to the one in which you want to be the location of the stored procedure. once you change the database as needed, execute the whole thing and you should be good to go! be sure to check for the location and refresh as needed to make sure everything went smoothly before moving on. please note that these steps may not be helpful if you made a typo or anything, so check your query that created the stored procedure to see where you may have an issue. i suppose in the future, for creating objects such as stored procedures and anything else that needs a location specified, placing that USE statement when you first write the query may be the best course of action. i'm still new to this so there may be better ways to do this. at any rate, i hope this helps!! :)  edit: an additional note! i learned that to specify the database location, you must use GO directly after the USE statement, otherwise you'll get an error saying that the CREATE statement must be first (not totally sure what the GO does in this case, if anyone knows please share! :) ) so when you're creating your stored procedure for the temp table, write this right before your CREATE statement:  USE [ ] GO  your desired database will go in the brackets of course :) then you should be good to go to continue writing your query!  edit 2: I double checked in my master database and saw i had a copy of my TEST stored procedure, so i just deleted them once i made sure i moved them to my desired database. so do with these copies as you see fit!",True
