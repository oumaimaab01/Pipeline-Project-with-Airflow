I just moved away from a job I loved as an Electrical engineer to a startup IT service provider company because of how huge the pay difference is. I studied SQL on my own, and excel just by myself. I know I'm the best at my company, but when looking at qualifications, I dawned to me how much I still need to learn. This was even slapped on my face on my job interview where they said that they can't give my asking salary because there's more ""skillful"" analysts in their hiring pool. It felt so bad, but I pushed through with my confidence, and am now studying more. I know I will face imposter syndrome once I start working there next week, but your insights would be a huge help in making me think more logically about myself, my career, and my growth",True

The imposter syndrome was one of the biggest challenges I had to overcome when I transitioned from a high schoolteacher to a project officer then to a data analyst in my forties in a country which I had migrated to. The transition started because I was seen as being good with Excel which I was not as I was learning everything through Googling and was quite frankly ""faking it"" simply to solve a problem and get things done in the most efficient way by reducing manual repetitive data tasks. Although I am still using Excel, I have since moved on to SAS EG, Power BI and Tableau and have learnt SQL and R though I rarely have to use them in my work. So, without the depth of experience in coding, I am feeling like an impostor again. But hopefully it will go away one day once the institution's central data team phase out SAS and bring in a data reporting tool which requires some SQL coding 😅. I don't think I got the 🍆 thing but I like 🍆 in curry and grilled 🍆 with miso paste 😉",True

@donnelly5757,2020-10-08T22:40:41Z,2,"I think I have what is opposite of imposter syndrome which is inferior complexity. I could be wrong as to the exact definition, but I consistently feel that I may never be good enough to get myself a good job. I tend to perceive myself as inferior to many people. I developed this when I was in the military. I went in at an older age (34) and everyone my age was either an officer or my superior. I began to suffer from depression and anxiety from the social isolation and feelings of loneliness and feelings of not being good enough or far enough in life.  Now having been three year's since I graduated with a master's degree in exercise science, I have yet to work a job that takes any sort of skill. Most the the jobs I have had the past three years are manual labor and retail jobs requiring nothing more than a high-school diploma. I am positive this is contributing to my worsening depression and anxiety along with inferior complexity. I now plan to begin an online master's program in analytics or AI and machine learning, I may end up doing both. I am hoping that by the time I graduate which will be around the age of 47 and having no domain experience, I can land my first data analyst job. I would hope to inspire other people who are in their mid 40s or older that it can be done even if you have worked none other than low-wage, low-skilled jobs. Besides my four years in the military, the most I have made in one year is around 19k. The day I do land a good job, I'll make sure to include some eggplant in my dinner! I thought I'd mention this. Things have been so bad as far as finding a job the past three years, that back in 2018 I filled out an application and sent a resume to work at McDonald's as a crew member! I never heard back!

Let it rest for 30 minutes. Step 3 In a pot mix the vinegar with the water, set aside. Step 4 Rinse the eggplant slices. Step 5 Cook the eggplant in the vinegar-water mixture for 2 or 3 minutes or until they have acquired the hardness of your liking. Check on them often as they tend to be very hard and then to soft quite quickly. Step 6 Drain the eggplant and set aside. Step 7 In a small bowl mix the olive oil with the spices and the bay leaves. Step 8 In a sterilized jar, alternate eggplant and the oil mixture. Remember to put the bay leaves in between. Step 9 When you are done, cover the rest of the jar with sunflower oil until the eggplants are fully covered. Step 10 Before consumption let rest for at least one week in the refrigerator so the eggplants are really infused with the flavor. Step 11 Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.  source: https://sigrilina.com/marinated-escabeche-eggplant/  You can add it to a sandwich or maybe as an appetizer . Great videos!",True
@robertosegarra6964,2020-10-08T17:55:51Z,1,"Eggplant! You’re right eggplants are underrated. I’ve been loving the show so far. I’m currently an audit underwriter for a major insurance company with a B.A in Finance. (Graduated in 2018) but there are little opportunities to go the financial analyst route right now so I’m stuck. With that said, I’m going back to get an MBA in business data analytics to hopefully merge my experience with finance to  data  analytics. Your channel has been a great help",True

@RobbertLobik,2020-10-08T15:52:46Z,2,"It's tricky though, right? It's imposter syndrome om one end (feeling you're not good enough) and the feeling you're too big of a fish in your pond on the other. Or is this an eggplant kind of reasoning? Perhaps the first is a better problem to have? I must be wrong, but not sure where.",True
@balaramkantipudi3728,2020-10-08T15:44:47Z,2,could you please make a video on masters in USA on data analytics and eventually settle there as DAta analyst or Data engineer. And good Universities and stuff,True

@CookWithMeldz,2020-10-08T15:26:38Z,2,"Thank you again, Alex! This topic is very important and only few people openly talk about this. I really needed to hear this from someone who's already in the industry. I'm not there yet but I already feel the anxiety but I feel better hearing this from you. 🍆🍆🍆",True
@cesarjr2571,2020-10-08T15:19:47Z,1,Thanks for your honesty. I'm a person that doesn't mind the truth usually it hurts but it must be said. I am interviewing for a junior data analyst role next Wednesday so I'm definitely feeling a little imposter syndrome but trying to be as confident as you are and remember the list you mentioned. Definitely will be re-watching some of your other videos as part of my prep. Thanks. Eggplant. 🍆🍆🍆,True
@balaramkantipudi3728,2020-10-08T15:17:27Z,1,"OMG!!! this is something awesome,, today itself I came to know that I face with imposter syndrome and in 6 hours here the video is",True
@avishekbiswas4121,2020-10-08T15:10:44Z,1,Eggplant! 🍆 It's funny I made a comment in that other video about imposter syndrome and you made a video about it! I''m actually surprised that imposter syndrome isn't something you can overcome by simply becoming better at your job,True
@mohammedbouchcoucha890,2020-10-08T15:07:50Z,3,"Thank you Alex, i watch all of your videos and always stick to the end, keep going, and this is my present to you for today 🍆🍆",True
@MrRandomGuy1231,2020-10-08T15:03:23Z,1,"I currently going back to school not hoping to change career but to incorporate more advance data analytics skills set to my current career beyond just excel. Your videos have been very helpful for me so far so thanks a lot! Anyway, imposter syndrome is real for me because I moved up the rank too quickly and mostly due to luck (promotion were available at locations that no one wants to relocate to and I was willing to). After a few promotions and finally relocated to a city I want to live in, I definitely feel  that I definitely should not have this job and always paranoid that I will be fired at every single one on one with my boss. So far no bad news yet but it is crazy how the feeling devalue your work. Sometimes I would accomplish something and always think that ""anyone could have done that.""",True
