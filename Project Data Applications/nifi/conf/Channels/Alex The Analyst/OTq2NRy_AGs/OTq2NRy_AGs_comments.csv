@AlexTheAnalyst,2020-01-25T16:53:34Z,8,Would you rather work at a BIG Company or a Small Company? Thanks for watching!,True
@liliaaricia,2023-02-12T14:21:35Z,1,This is really interesting ðŸ¥° I think I would love to start in a smaller company  because I am more interested in learning as much as I can at this stage. Money will come later,True

@KyleG384,2022-09-02T23:11:22Z,0,I would rather work at a BIG company!,True
@manojpawar873,2022-08-03T06:03:32Z,0,"Hello, at the age of 35 after having experience of about 12 years in small and mid size organization, should I join big company for stability, pay and experience? Please advise",True
@kodithegirlie,2022-04-05T13:52:55Z,0,I definitely am open to either but I can see the benefit of having more access so that you are more efficient. Working at a smaller company definitely gives you the chance to do every aspect of your role rather than it being divided by a larger team. Benefits to both!,True
@matteomontanari2960,2022-03-20T23:51:56Z,1,"Had the same experience, I can endorse everything you said!",True
@josefito123,2022-03-03T21:52:43Z,2,"Literally I relate to everything you mentioned, I am also a Data Analyst and started my career in a small company as a Lead, now I am in a huge company as an Analyst and I get paid more and have more benefits, but my job status is lower :)",True

@MrKensiu,2021-04-18T11:06:39Z,3,"start from small company, will have so many exposures",True
@antonycatella5901,2021-04-06T23:07:05Z,10,I think you hit the nail on the head with the differences. The great thing about small companies that I enjoy is exactly what you said - the opportunity to learn multiple skills that you are less likely to get to know in a big company.,True
@brandonpennington872,2021-02-13T23:25:22Z,4,"I currently work at a small company as a Data Analyst/QA for an out of the box EDI Processing system.  While my predominate role is data analysis/QA, I've seen myself wearing a few hats. My first year, I was doing general support as well for the department, along with data analysis and QA. My second year, I'm seeing myself doing internal/test case development and more escalated support as it was recently established I would no longer do general support tickets and only take stuff on occasion.  I personally like wearing a lot of hats as it helps me grow, but I'd like to work at a big company as well.",True
@caraziegel7652,2020-08-26T00:32:49Z,5,"Love it!  I worked at a medium-ish company which had been bought out by a larger company out of the country, but they werent very involved in the daily business yet when i was there.  I know EVERYTHING within a year - but was unable to get a promotion and eventually left for a family break.  now i'm a contractor at a very large company and i've been there almost 6 months and feel like I know nothing!  its also harder to get noticed for other roles because everyone is so overwhelmed all the time.  there's definitely more potential to learn more skills at the larger company but i do miss knowing people.",True
