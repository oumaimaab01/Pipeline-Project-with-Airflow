@rnseby,2023-12-01T22:55:28Z,3,I was tasked with creating and formatting Billing Details spreadsheets for all our customer accounts. The starting point was multiple CSV and Excel documents. I used Python with Pandas and OpenPyXL. I'd consider this more Report Automation then Data Analysis. But I do use some of the scripting to create other reporting based on at the moment needs. Great thing about doing reporting this way is I can save the scripts and at a later time rerun it using current data sets. Excel can be used as the ending point of the automation and analysis to provide the results to non-developer / non-analyst users.,True
