@ashrafshaikh9392,2024-03-06T15:33:01Z,0,"00:00 üõ† This video is the final installment in a beginner Tableau tutorial series, focusing on a complete project. 00:46 üé® The project aims to cover basics but offers insights into various visualizations and data analysis techniques. 01:56 üìä The project uses an Airbnb dataset, specifically the Seattle Airbnb open dataset, with listings, pricing, and reviews. 02:53 üìà The data has been consolidated into one CSV file and made available on GitHub for ease of access. 04:29 üí° Understanding the data columns is crucial as not all data may be relevant for visualization. 06:04 üß© Proper understanding of data relationships is essential for accurate data joining and analysis. 07:15 üîç Data manipulation, such as filtering and joining, ensures accurate visualization creation. 10:50 üîÑ Checking and confirming joins is vital to ensure correct data integration. 12:30 üìâ Removing unnecessary data helps optimize visualization creation and processing speed. 15:44 üè° The project's use case involves optimizing Airbnb listings based on factors like location and pricing. 17:58 üé® Creating visualizations, such as price by zip code, helps identify optimal locations for Airbnb listings. 18:39 üó∫ Maps can be created using location data like latitude and longitude to visualize distribution and patterns. 19:20 üîç When working with zip code data in Tableau, ensure consistency and separate zip codes for better visualization. 21:13 üé® Visualizations in Tableau can be enhanced by adding labels and average price information for better understanding. 23:20 üè° Analyzing the best times for Airbnb listings can be done using time series data in Tableau to identify peak periods of demand. 32:52 üí∞ The number of bedrooms significantly impacts Airbnb prices, with larger homes commanding higher prices per night. 35:40 üìä Visualizing competition for Airbnb listings by the number of bedrooms can provide insights into market demand and competition. 40:17 üìä Completing the dashboard layout in Tableau by arranging visualizations and discussing its potential for answering questions and generating further inquiries. 41:54 üíª Sharing the Tableau dashboard to Tableau Public for easy access and viewing by others, encouraging viewers to explore the provided link for personal use or comparison. 43:07 üìà Encouraging viewers to utilize the Kaggle data for additional fields and explore different data points to create unique dashboards and visualizations for their portfolios.",True

@luisf7105,2021-12-09T21:15:30Z,1,"Hey Alex, I found you on YouTube about two months ago. I really appreciate all the great content you upload. I started the Google Analytics Certificate Program three weeks ago. I'm at the last module the capstone portion. I'm brand spanking new to this field with 0 tech background, so I really don't feel this cert will be enough to obtain a real job. Needless to say, I'm considering forgoing the capstone for an online Data Analytics Bootcamp from a university in a neighboring county where I live. Any opinion will be greatly appreciated!",True
@jonathanpugh4891,2021-12-09T16:55:48Z,111,Issue: Map not showing data Resolution: If you find that the map does not pop up as in the guide check the bottom right of the map to see if any values are unknown. You may just have to change the country the data is being checked against to get the values to appear.,True
@dianadennis7225,2021-12-09T02:23:33Z,2,"Any chance we can see a part 2 or a more complex project to understand what advanced Tableau entails?
