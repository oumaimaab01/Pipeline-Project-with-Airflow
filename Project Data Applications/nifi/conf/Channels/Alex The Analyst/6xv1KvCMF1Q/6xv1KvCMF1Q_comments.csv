One suggestion I would make is to be more specific where on the page buttons are when you speak. In this video, you often say ""We'll go over here and do X"", but as I was trying to follow along, I often lost exactly where on the page you clicked and I had to rewind in order to keep up (I watch videos on one screen and actively follow along on another). This was especially important in software like Tableau, which is mostly just icons. So if you could say something more like ""We'll go over to the bottom left of the chart"" instead of ""over here"", I think it could help a lot of people follow along much easier and reinforce what you're saying. Not a huge problem because YouTube is infinitely rewindable, but I figured it could help.",True

Following a cursor can be like trying to find the golden snitch, but worse when it is the same color as the screen. Instead of go here, how about go here ""to the bottom right"", or click this ""icon with the down arrow on the top bar"", or over here ""on the left"".

@andrewskusi6980,2021-09-21T12:48:09Z,0,"Thanks Alex ! Please I need your honest advice. I recently graduated with bachelors degree in Health Informatics and also completed the google data analytics certificate. I applied to a senior healthcare data analyst position with no work experience and I got an initial interview last week. Tbh I didn‚Äôt do well on that initial interview but the manager told me that it‚Äôs a new position in the hospital so I‚Äôll be the first person to be on the team if I‚Äôm hired. I feel like they desperately need to fill the position. I asked her the next steps in the interview process and she advised that the director of analytics will reach out to me for a final interview. The director reached out and the final interview is tomorrow, he send me the layout for the interview. Behavioral questions, critical thinking exercise, I‚Äôll be given a file to work on for 20 minutes and then the department team will join the interview for peer interview and file review. I‚Äôm really nervous and scared that I might not do well on the interview or even if I passed the interview and get the job, I might underperform since I don‚Äôt have any working experience in data analytics. What do you think I should do? Should I go ahead and do the interview or email them and let them know about my situation ? I wanted an entry/mid level position to work my way up üîù",True
