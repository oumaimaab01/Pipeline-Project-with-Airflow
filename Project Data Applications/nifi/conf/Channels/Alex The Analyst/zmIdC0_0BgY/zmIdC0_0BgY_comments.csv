@maddie8564,2024-05-11T12:18:08Z,0,"I wonder if it has to do with having a newer version of Jupyter, considering how long ago the video was published. I wrote the exact same code on the first example (integers = [1,2,3,4,5] to follow along, and I got an error message: ""name 'integers' is not defined."" Any help? By the way, thank you for explaining so well! I love watching your videos.  Update: never mind. I defined 'integers' by adding:  for x in integers:  print(x)  and it worked. I'm leaving this update here in case another novice like me encounters the same issue. ;-) Alex, your videos have been extremely helpful! Thanks!",True

@rbsorg,2023-07-23T03:49:18Z,1,"With no real experience with Python, as a use case in the Healthcare industry, would  you nest for loop a diagnosis and cpt codes commonly associated with the diagnosis then compare what was in { } or not in { }?   I guess you could then compare what doctors then usually do what procedures on a diagnosis.  BTW, is that something an analyst or scientist be more likely to do! Thanks for breaking this down to the Nub3 level!",True

@JokeJoshua,2023-03-13T13:41:32Z,0,"Hi Alex, please what is wrong with this code  it seems to be calculating wrongly.  # write a program that asks the user to enter 5 positive integers , # the program disregards negative values and zeros and makes the user re enter an input if so. # The program is capable of calculating both sum and product of all the numbers entered . # after taking the inputs # it asks the user whether they want to print the sum of the numbers # or products and then shows the result accordingly  count = 0 sum = 0 product = 1 while count <= 4 :     numbers = int(input(""Please enter 5 different inputs:         ""))     print()     count += 1     if numbers == 0 or numbers < 0 :         print(""Please re-enter input"") else:     print(""Would you like to multiply of add the total numbers"")     choose = input(""Choose to multiply or add now:          "")     if choose == ""add"":         for x in range(numbers):             sum = sum + numbers         print(sum)     if choose == ""multiply"":         for x in range(numbers) :             product = product * numbers         print(product)",True
