@user-kq3tc5tu1c,2024-05-13T01:12:57Z,2,"Alex, this series on MySQL is really polished, no hiccups at all.  Also appreciate your GitHub repository where I can also follow along with your SQL files.  It's great to see SQL syntax that just works the way it is supposed to.  I also appreciate the occasional ""best practice"" you share (i.e. Normally using proper column names in the GROUP BY clause vice column numbers, etc.)  Working smart, not hard ALWAYS appeals to my brain.  Thanks again for the awesome content!  ðŸ˜‰",True
@JJCage78,2024-04-24T18:26:38Z,2,@3:15 You select from employee_salary and group by gender. employee_salary does not have a gender column. I could not get it to work due to the group by request. I also used the select * as you did. The select * would only apply to the employee_salary and not the entire DB since you specified from that table.,True

@inq_3166,2023-11-29T17:51:38Z,0,Thank you Alex.  I Just started learning data analytics with your bootcamp playlist and currently I am a little bit confused whether I continue learning the SQL part or jump to excel part and at the same time keep following this MySQL serie. I'm thinking about doing it all because I'm still a rookie and I have to learn. I will be happy to hear your suggestion. And thank you once again Alex for you content.,True
