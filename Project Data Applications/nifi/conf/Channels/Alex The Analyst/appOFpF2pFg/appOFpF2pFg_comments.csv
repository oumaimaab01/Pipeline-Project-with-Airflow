@JJ_TheGreat,2021-06-28T03:14:11Z,0,"4:20 You can use their free videos, but how much time are you going to have for that before your trial expires?",True
@JJ_TheGreat,2021-06-28T03:12:29Z,0,"4:01 Sorry Alex, but I am going to have to disagree with you here. Power BI has Power BI Desktop, which is free. You can fool around with it, along with Power Query - a powerful (pun intended) tool to manipulate: clean/wrangle your data before creating your visualizations. Tableau, on the other hand, costs to get into. Yes, you can get a 7-day trial, but realistically, how many Tableau courses can you finish in 1 week?  Therefore, I find Power BI to be more accessible to get into.",True
@michaelsabatino8763,2021-05-29T18:15:11Z,0,"Alex, or anyone else. I made a big mistake on my application. I was looking at my documents I had when I was applying for a data analyst position. I graduated with a bachelors degree in general studies, but decided to go back for my computer science degree and my masters in data analytics.  So the thing is I used the computer science program when I should have used the degree I was actually conferred. This honestly was a mistake. I have the skills to become DA and my on boarding for the job is next Monday. Do you think the HR team will understand the mistake or will they simply just fire me. I really don‚Äôt know how to correct the error.",True

I have a question about that if you know and able to help, I work in a lab that test samples for hospitals and health centers. Do you know what options I have if I'm looking for a related job that works with data, like you worked in health care and then later your data jobs are related to what you did so you made a connection there. I just don't know how to look for something like that for me.",True
