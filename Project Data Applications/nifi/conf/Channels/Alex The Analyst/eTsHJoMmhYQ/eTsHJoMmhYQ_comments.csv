@tronghoang97,2020-10-02T17:40:03Z,12,"Interesting facts about Cabbage  1. Ancient roots. Cabbage has been cultivated for longer than almost any other vegetable on record. To be precise, more than 6,000 years! It originated in Shensi Province, China, sometime around 4,000 B.C.  2. Elixir for Baldness. In ancient China (roughly 1000 B.C.) scrolls touted cabbage as a magic cure-all for bald men. It‚Äôs hard to say if there‚Äôs any truth in this claim, but no one can deny cabbage is chock full of nutrients that promote good health.  3. Vitamin C Galore. Cabbage contains a high concentration of Vitamin C. That means it cuts out toxins in your body, preventing skin disease, arthritis, and rheumatism. Go for red cabbage when you have Vitamin C in mind. It contains double the content of regular green cabbage.",True

@MrTulio8,2022-01-18T16:36:38Z,1,"Cabbage!  Hi Alex, this is me again watching today's video.... Another of my goals, besides changing career to data analyst and finding a job on June, is to find an English language based job, and hopefully emigrating from my country. I'm thinking of Mexico where I am at the moment... the struggle though is that to be able to work in another country there are always a lot of legal things you have to get that I think might not be easy.  But, at the same time, with all this ""remote work"" revolution since COVID, I have a theory that maybe I can find a remote job, in English, without the need of work permits, etc. and just travel while I work. Do you think this is a real possibility?, I think you are not an immigrant so probably don't have a lot of experience working in another countries, but do you have any insight, or advice on this?... maybe from the ""company hiring immigrants"" position?",True

@sidhantyadav1358,2020-10-01T19:22:27Z,19,"I was in the United States up until July 2020, as an international student, and the job market plundered as the cases progressed. For someone like me, fresh out of college, in a different country, and looking for a career in data analytics, everything came crashing down as time progressed. I had no choice but to come back to India and try my hand in the Indian market, which again, has had similar outcomes. I came across your youtube channel and your course recommendations, and I just went ahead and started all over again. It is safe to say that I am making progress, though I haven't landed a job.

Feels like employer expectations for candidates are sky high because they know they have their pick of the litter. I‚Äôm sick of the gaslighting too. I legitimately didn‚Äôt get one job after 4 rounds of interviews because the manager thought ‚ÄúI have been unemployed for too long already.‚Äù    You were definitely right that most companies are not that open to Remote, and the ones that say they are are still expecting you to relocate. Most of the local companies to me are in hiring freezes. I‚Äôm really not sure what I‚Äôm going to do. I think there was maybe like 5 jobs I could even realistically apply to all of last month.

Lots of people are not only graduating and applying to these roles, but a lot of analysts lost their jobs.   So now data jobs are in a huge predicament.
