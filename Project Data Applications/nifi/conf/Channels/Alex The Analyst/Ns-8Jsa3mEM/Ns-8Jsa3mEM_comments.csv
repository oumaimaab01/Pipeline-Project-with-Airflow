Soft skills are called soft skills for a reason. They are not something that can be shown. It is something that can only be by how you carry yourself throughout work day in, day out.

@simonediluna,2021-08-29T08:09:23Z,9,"Hi Alex, thanks for your contents. In my experience, there is no universal rules, it depends on the country you live in.

@dean8147,2021-08-13T20:48:11Z,4,Strongly recommend NOT using graphics such as charts to illustrate skill level. Its highly subjective to the reader since 25 year senior software engineer's '4/5' would be a 25/5 for a student.. and vice versa. Plain and simple is the key,True

@arthurmiller5276,2021-06-08T18:35:40Z,14,"A big caution with a lot of the resume templates in this video is they all have some form of columns in how they're formatted. While they may look great to a recruiter or hiring manager once you get an interview, most job applications are going to be submitted online and uploaded to an applicant tracking system (ATS). For those that utilize uploading an electronic document (Word or PDF), the ATS is going to have a hard time distinguishing different areas in columns. This may result in have to clean up or simply enter manually all the information the ATS is looking for like contact information, skills and work experience.",True

@luizscheuer670,2020-07-27T12:07:27Z,4,"I slightly disagree with the skill bar way of showing how proficient one is. I saw a video from Joshua Fluke where he argues that different people use different parameters to evaluate their skills. So what does a 75% filled bar mean? How different is it from a 80% filled one? How do you quantify this? Also, perhaps employers could look at a non-100% filled bar and say: ""if he is not even secure about his skill set, why should we hire them?"" or they might not see a 75% filled bar as enough, even though your intention was to show you have a good grasp, but still has some room to improve, for example. I don't know, just felt like noting this because I like the concept and how it looks in the resume, but I think the disadvantages of the interpretation behind it outweigh the advantages.",True
@dp6736,2020-02-24T00:03:37Z,10,"According to on the resume expert, we are supposed to have three resumes for three different purpose. 1. For job boards: Resumes are selected by recruiters with help of ATS, scanners which uses frequency of keywords to select about top 'x' (i.e. 25) resumes. This means a resume with more keywords with high frequencies has higher probability to be one of those 'x' resumes. That means it could be 4 pages long.  2. For human: When recruiters or HR contacts you, send them a one page resume but very easy to read and follow. 3. For job interview: Take a single page resume, but designed as a marketing material as presentation with key achievements. I would appreciate your comments on them.",True
