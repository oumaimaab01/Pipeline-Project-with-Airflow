@MocaJesus,2023-07-03T12:59:38Z,2,Hi Alex! Question: I’m considering taking the Google Professional Data Analytics course but I’m wondering if it’s a better investment in my time and money to just knock out the Udemy courses you recommend instead. The time commitment on each seems about the same per course but the Udemy courses seem to go further in depth while the Google program does come with a certificate and looks like it explains a lot about what a data analyst does. I truly value and appreciate your insight. Thanks you!!!,True

I am taking a class in this for CS degree but I don't feel like software developing would be fitted for me. I have no problems studying calculus 3, linear algebra or statistic but when it comes to implementing code, I struggle a lot. I had no problems in understanding code and basics like array, loops but data structure is on diferent level. Do data analyst have to study data structures and algorithms?",True

It is bit sad you did not mention the course I enrolled last week on udemy: The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp.   Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/  I have just finished the first of the seven parts and found to be extremely great for someone who is new to Data Science, which I am. I needed a course to introduce me into this field: What it is, skills required, etc... Then, I will go with more specialized courses like Python, SQL, maths, etc...  Let me know my choice.   I have 7 years experience in technical department where I did bit of data analytics (albeit with excel, SQL). My core JD was network troubleshooting and maintenance.",True
@abdulazizataullaev,2020-10-22T16:11:48Z,1,"Dear Alex Freberg  Hope you are doing well.   My name is Abdulaziz Ataullaev.  Thanks for the great content. I took some of your recommended courses and started my job as an entry-level data analyst.  Would it be possible for you to answer my question, please?   Thanks for you helpful really interesting content I found the way to become a data analyst.   I learned Excel then I have been learning SQL and was planning to learn Python. Also, working as a junior data analyst in a part-time job. The company that I work is in retail industry which sell shoes and they use local CRM system which is like Slaesforce. I get data from CRM system which means there is no need to use SQL. I was surprised how come I do not use SQL because company is still considered as a startup and do not allow analysts to use SQL yet. As an analyst I have access to any data that I need but it is sometimes time consuming to gather all the necessary data from CRM system. So I asked the permission to get the data by using SQL but they said there is no way.   So my question is what should I do? I thought, I would use SQL but there is no permission for using it. Now I am going to learn Python and keep working on my current job because I like what I am doing, I am working on real business and having great experience.    Thanks for taking you time to read my comment.  I am looking forward to your answer.  P.S. I wrote this all here because I thought it would be helpful for your audience.",True
