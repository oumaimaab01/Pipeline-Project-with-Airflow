@user-kq3tc5tu1c,2024-05-16T01:07:47Z,1,I have only experienced CTEs in Alex's YouTube lessons.  I believe I will learn more when I use CTEs out in the wild.  Reasonable pace with clear instructions.  I feel challenged in Alex's courses but NEVER stupid.  We all have to start somewhere and it's helpful to have someone showing me the way that has walked this path.  Much gratitude for your efforts Alex.  Cheers!  ðŸ˜Ž,True

@Luis_Domingos,2024-03-13T11:27:35Z,0,"May I ask in which real-world scenario would getting an average of averages without weighing by their relative counts make sense? I know this was just a didactic example, but I was still a bit puzzled by that considering the fact that an actual population average would have to consider how many people are contributing for each average: ((avg_salary * count_salary) WHERE gender = female) + ((avg_salary * count_salary) WHERE gender = male) / the sum of both counts. Thanks in advance!",True
@NicheOrNitch,2024-03-13T10:54:23Z,1,Hey Alex! Love the video on CTEs. I'm wondering if you'd consider making one on solving a gaps and islands problem? I've watched and read tutorials on them and the overview logic makes sense but I tend to get a bit lost when applying all the various window functions. Thanks!,True
@malcorub,2024-03-12T16:35:43Z,0,"Great lesson and the next one on #Temp tables will be too.  Last week,  one first round interview question (non technical part of the interview series) I was asked was ""describe the difference between a CTE and a #Temp Table.""  Alex basically answered that in this video....   Gotta be ready to answer these types of questions on the fly. ðŸ™‚",True
