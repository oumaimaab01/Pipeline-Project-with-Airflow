@malcorub,2023-10-26T16:27:29Z,1,"I've been in my current role for a little over a year, this is my first healthcare analyst role using SAS.  I feel that we use SAS Enterprise Guide very little for statistical purposes and more for ETL from several different data sources, as our primary team database and for automated scheduled reporting with extracts to shared locations and emailed attachments (Excel, PDF and embedded email body reports) similar to how I used to use  Microsoft's SSRS in my previous teams.  For dashboards, we push data out to Tableau to build them there.",True

I think SAS is capable of what R isn't capable of. But I don't know if it can beat Python. I would rather not use SAS because it is pain to learn",True

@richardruane8361,2023-09-26T12:20:55Z,0,"The greatest thing about SAS is you can do a huge amount of tasks in SQL. I've missed SAS because of this when using e.g. Pandas in Python and would look for packages like sqldf so I could do work in SQL. Also some of its built in procedures are extremely powerful and more advanced than in Python, Proc Compare being the biggest example in my mind.  In one of its IDEs, Enterprise Guide, there's also a fantastic function called Query Builder which lets you build SQL queries very quickly by clicking and dragging. It also has a nice, very straightforward functionality to link scripts together in a workflow, like Airflow, but much simpler.  One downside of SAS is for some reason teams I've worked on using it, atleast in banking, have been skimpy on proper version controlling - and this has caused a lot of issues and lack of trust. One reason is that if you embed a script in Enterprise Guide, it can't be accessed by Git.",True
