@AbdulKareemAbdulRahman,2022-10-11T10:26:03Z,0,"Hi Alex,  Just a thought on the DA training/course 'market'.  I was wondering why DA training/courses are 'sold' as certificates when the costs (close and upwards of ¬£6k or ¬£7k) seem close to those of full academic degrees (diplomas, or masters), even when provided (or co-provided) by universities themselves.  Is it because employers prefer these certificates over academic degrees?  Or they are too short in duration, or the content not extensive enough, to be considered degrees?  Would be grateful for any input or advice as I don't want to commit to spending that is driven mostly by marketing trends as distinct from actual professional need (eg obtaining other ways to bolster CV in terms of DA training, via other options such as MOOC certifications; portfolios etc).  Thanks",True

@Cohnan13,2021-05-01T11:54:26Z,0,"Summary for Personal Reference: his point of view is that certifications are valuable only on the very first stages of a career, where no job experience can certify the skills that certifications are supposed to. Furthermore, what is more valuable that certifications is a Portafolio, which shows that you can indeed do stuff and have certain skills and knolwedge. Now, were you to choose to get a certification, choose one where the company backing up this is well known, if it isn't, even if it was the most amazing course, it is not worth putting in your Resume, nor is it from Learning Platforms like Udemy or Coursera even if the course is amazing because getting the certificate doesn't take much. The certifications that he thinks hold value are: Microsoft/Azure Data Analyst Associate, AWS Certified Data Analyst Specialty, Tableu Cerification (AWS and Azure vertifications in general hold a lot of value).",True

Main reason for farmers to grow radishes because radishes capture, store, and then release nutrients back into the soil, so they can reduce the need for fertilizer in the spring. They are attractive option to no-till farmers, who plant without plowing or otherwise turning the soil to enrich it, retain moisture and reduce erosion. So they have benefits that are not too obvious to the city folks like us! LOL ; )",True

I just recently started working as a data analyst at F500 in healthcare field. I have gone about 20 data analyst interview at big companies and none of them care about the certifications. Certification doesn't mean much to hiring managers. The portfolio is much more important, the hiring manager wanted to see how I apply those skills into practices. Having the portfolio is very important because that's what I mostly talked during the interview, like what steps did I take to solve those problems, what was the outcome of it, etc. The hiring manager wants to see my analytical mindset, how I approach the problems and how to answer those problems quantitatively. Some of them even said ""we want to see your analytical thinking process than your technical ability. Technical skills can be taught and learned on the job"". I mostly use Power BI for data viz, Excel and SQL Server for data cleaning and manipulation. I also work in a team setting and in our team has a business analyst, two data analysts, a data developer and other roles. I know basic Python but don't have experience using it. the Sr. Data Analysts use a lot of Python at the company so I am planning to start doing some projects on my own using Python to get my feet wet!!",True
