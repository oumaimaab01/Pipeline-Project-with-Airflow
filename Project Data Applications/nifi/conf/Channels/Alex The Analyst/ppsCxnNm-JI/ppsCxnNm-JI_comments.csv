@NightWalker911,2024-02-16T06:13:52Z,0,"Great Videos Alex. I've learnt a lot from yourself, for which I can't thank you enough!! üôå  However, there's something in this lesson, that's left me a little puzzled.   I hope you, or anyone out there, would be kind enough to help out.    So, when you did the basic   a[6] - it returned 'W'.  a[2:5] - returned 'llo'  However a[2:6] - returns  'llo ' (including space)  a[2:7] - returns 'llo W'  So I'm curious as to why the position number of 'W' has changed, from 6 to 7?   Thanks",True

@andremayes7788,2024-01-26T22:10:06Z,0,"Hi Alex, thank you so much for this course. I have gone through all of the videos from SQL to now Python, have joined your discord and have begun to tinker around on the Analyst builder app. I have a question for you, but let me give some context first.   I am starting to learn python data types and got through the entire lesson without a hitch until the very last part, delete statements. I am getting an key error traceback that from my research tells me that the key path may not exist. However, I looked at what you ran in Jupyter and what I ran, and they seem to be identical. Here is the error that I am receiving:  KeyError                                                  Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In [70], line 1 ------> 1  del dict_cream['weight']           3  print(dict_cream)  KeyError: 'weight' --------------------------------  Here is the dictionary I executed:  {'name' : 'Christine Freberg', 'weekly intake' : 10,  'favorite ice creams' : ['MCC', 'Chocolate'], 'weight' : 300 -------------------------------  Here is the delete statement I executed:  del dict_cream['weight']  print(dict_cream) __________________  Question:  Any clues as to why I am receiving the key error? I have run through it but am unable to figure it out.",True
@sj1795,2023-12-24T20:58:33Z,9,"Fantastic video Alex! I love how you organized all this information. It made it SO much easier to grasp compared to other times I've tried to tackle Python.
