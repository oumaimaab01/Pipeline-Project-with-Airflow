I am currently working with Udacity on a course on ML nanodegree using Azure. I was learning SQL as I figured out would need.

@PaulMTC,2020-11-07T11:01:10Z,0,hi alex enjoying your videos. you mentioned a udemy course you highly recommend for tableau which is good for dashboard creation etc - which one is this (i don't see anything obvious in the description). you also mentioned that it's easy to get stockmarket data to analyse - where is the best place to get that? can you recommend the best resources for data sets in general? thanks,True

@regalix5967,2020-11-02T18:27:20Z,3,Thanks for the Q&A Alex! I missed this one but will tune in for the next one. Can I ask - I have a degree in economics (which I enjoyed) and I’m considering moving into Analytics. Do you suggest a good way to get my feet wet and determine if this is an area I can excel in? I’m trying to really get a feel for the complexity of the work and if it’s right for someone like me. I appreciate your feedback!,True

Select-where based queries or Creating Databases & tables or conditional expressions - stored procedures. If the answer cannot be given in a word, please try to allot some percentages to it. Sorry for a silly ask.  I did complete a course  though but do wanna know specific areas if any.So, I can plan for a project within.",True
