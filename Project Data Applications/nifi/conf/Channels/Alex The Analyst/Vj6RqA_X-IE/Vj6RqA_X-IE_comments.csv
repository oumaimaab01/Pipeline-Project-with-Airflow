As the previous commenter suggests, I need MORE practice to really get these concepts embedded into the ""gray matter"" inside my head.  At the very least, I intend to re-watch this video a couple of times without trying to keep up typing code, etc.  I am getting a great deal of value from all of Alex's work.  Thanks!  ðŸ˜Ž",True
