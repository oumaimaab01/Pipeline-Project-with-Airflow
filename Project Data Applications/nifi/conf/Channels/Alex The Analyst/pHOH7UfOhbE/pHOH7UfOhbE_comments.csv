@user-re4ip5ms9w,2024-05-15T11:47:22Z,0,just asking do you need to rename it to .ipynb at the end because I renamed mine without the .ipynb and when I open the file it brings me to a text file I didn't see any way to switch it to notebook so my work around with it is naming it .ipynb at the end,True

@supersql8406,2023-07-23T07:04:29Z,0,"Hi Alex, I'm taking some online courses and I always see that in the codes we always assigned methods( or functions) into a variable. Is there a reason for this or is it just best practices in coding? For example, I'm building  a Naive Bayes Model and we assigned the methods( or functions) like this gnb = GaussianNB(). So, to reiterate my question, why do we need to assign it to gnb why can't I just use GaussianNB()?",True
