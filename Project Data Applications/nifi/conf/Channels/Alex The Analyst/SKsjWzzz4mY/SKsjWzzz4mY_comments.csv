@stevew4079,2021-07-18T06:41:46Z,0,"I‚Äôm not kidding, the first three I was like, ‚Äònope!‚Äô  Next I was like, ‚Äòyes‚Äô. I love being the ‚Äòexcel guy‚Äô at work and love data and working with it. But I‚Äôm not a fix-it guy and I‚Äôm not the ‚Äòsuper organised‚Äô type. I‚Äôm left wondering whether or not this is for me.  What can I do to further explore? I don‚Äôt want to write off a possible career that I might love.   From your videos comparing data analyst to business analyst or data scientist, I definitely had my suspicions confirmed that data analyst was what I had in mind for what I wanted.   It‚Äôs the whole, ‚Äòbuild dashboards and create reports‚Äô thing...that‚Äôs what I think I would love and be good at (based on the small exposure I‚Äôve had at different times in my job)",True

I think I'll do well in data analytics and I'd like to explore this arena. But as a newbie idk where to start ! Could you help me please ? Like recommending a course? It'll be of great help sir. Appreciate the efforts you put in your videos :) Also, would you recommend Udemy or Coursera ?   Edit: I like identifying patterns, solving coding questions which are based on patterns and all.

I fit many of these qualities, like I like learning, coding/programming and understanding statistics and economics/business, I like organizing things.

@AaronMOliver,2020-09-22T22:04:35Z,4,Couldn't agree with number 1 more.  You really need to have a natural sense of curiosity to succeed in the field.  I'd add onto number 4: written communication.  Particularly since COVID I've seen a lot of previously face-to-face interaction turn into text and those with good writing skills could really take advantage of that!,True

@urosjovanovic3142,2020-09-22T19:04:39Z,8,"Hi Alex, thanks for the video, it's very useful! üôÇ I just found your channel couple a days ago and I really enjoy it. As someone who's interested in becoming Data Analyst, I find it quite awesome üôÇ I have a question for you: can you make a video of a typical project Junior Data Analysts could work on? I think there are a lot of people who would like to see the workflow and how you implement your ideas. I'm familiar with the software that Data Analysts use, it's just that I'm not quite sure about the responsibilities and obligations one could have (how do you gather data, how do you organize it, what do companies usually expect, etc.)... Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us all! Best of luck in the future!",True
