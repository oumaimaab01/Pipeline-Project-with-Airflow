I took the Managing Big Data With MySQL from Duke University when I was new to SQL and some of the queries to pass the last exam took me upwards of 3 hours to figure out! I am now taking the Tableau Specialization you mentioned. I plan to get my Oracle Database Associate certification along with a Tableau certification by year's end if not early next year!",True

@cynthiadavis2680,2020-10-13T22:03:21Z,2,This is a great video! I signed up for the Introduction to Data Science Specialization but I am confused on the pricing structure. Coursera says the program is free for 7 days and then they will charge $40. Do you know if they charge $40 monthly for this program or whether it's a 1 time fee of $40 for access to the course forever? I have also seen that Coursera+ is $400/year and that might be the most cost effective option if I decide do multiple courses.,True

A quick question (and sorry if you've answered this in other videos): I'm currently taking the Python for Everybody specialization on Coursera but I'm finding that the few assignments in each chapter aren't enough to solidify the lessons for me; any recommendations on how/where to practice beginner python skills?

@avishekbiswas4121,2020-10-13T17:03:15Z,4,"Alex, I got a question for you. Assuming you have the skills but have work experience in an unrelated field, what do you think about transitioning into a senior analyst role directly by skipping the junior analyst role? Is it feasible? I'm asking because a recruiter thinks i'm a good fit for a senior data analyst position and the job requirement list is ridiculous excluding years of experience. I'm afraid of trying to meet unrealistic expectations. The job is mostly data exploration of life reinsurance data  PS: great list by the way! It will really help people to narrow down on what to focus on",True

@drinified6557,2020-10-13T16:17:36Z,3,"Hey Alex! I really wanna learn data analysis and I am currently taking Coursera courses. However, since most of the courses I'm taking are introductory, how can I apply what I learned from the course to learn more?
