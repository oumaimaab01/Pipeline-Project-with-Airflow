@christsciple,2022-12-29T22:02:26Z,1,"Hey great to hear Alex! I'm sure you have solid plans ahead for teaching. My advice is to replicate actual projects and products you were involved with in your daily (now previous) job. There are hundreds if not thousands of content creators that cover the basics of Python, SQL, PBI, etc. I think what's really lacking is not teaching the fundamentals, but showing how that ties into real-world projects and applications. I've been a data analyst/systems analyst/RPA guy/data engineer/software engineer/architect/developer for 20 years and the overwhelming majority of courses I see are foo-bar (basics of programming).  Why not cover a more complex scenario with actual real-world ties? Something like ""hey I have all these different files; CSV's, txt/flat files, COSMOS/Mongo/NoSQL, JSON, and SQL data - with seemingly no commonality between them all, how do I tie these together into a dashboard to give me daily/weekly/monthly/yearly sales numbers broken down by sales person/region?"" This could be broken up into a series where you show how you problem solve and adapt to unexpected outcomes or problems that arise along the way. Add features and functionality as well. You could include SQL, VBA, PowerShell/Bash, Python, a whole host of languages and approaches. It's complex and fairly time-consuming but it's also the differentiator between what your channel could be and what all others are.   For a lot of analysts the data is not straightforward nor is it in an easily consumable format. There's a lot of messy joins, conditions, parsing of various files, modelling, integration, and orchestration.  Just as a thought, you could use existing datasets like the NorthWinds db, or Kaggle, or build a scraper to obtain the data.  If I had more free time available I would create content like that myself but alas I can only offer up my ideas to others like you for the time being.  Whatever you choose, good luck to you!",True

@RossChase,2022-12-20T18:44:26Z,7,Hi Alex. I've commented on a couple of videos before but I feel like typing out a long one . At the beginning of 2020 I felt the urge towards getting into analytics..My then job relied on a lot of the same things plus my chemistry background. I dipped my toe in the water with some courses and really enjoyed it. My job however was time consuming and I wanted more work life balance to spend more time with my son. It was hearing your story and the encouragement of my girlfriend that gave me to push to leave my job and to get into the field full time. Have done some consulting as I'm learning ( My home country of Barbados is really behind in seeing the value of analytics) and pursuing either my first job in the area or being a full time consultant. It's been rough at times but I wouldn't change it. Thanks for your help in pushing me in that direction. All the best in your new endeavours. I'll be watching.  Ross Chase (The Bajan Data Guy),True

@vimalrathod9026,2022-12-20T15:11:54Z,4,"So I have been hovering over the topic of data analysis and data engineering and the data field in general, for about four years. I have been through a bunch of certifications, talked to a lot of peers, but I wasn't able to start my journey to crack my way into the field, and work on the stuff that feels a lot relatable than other things. Now Finally after about 8 months of focused efforts, I am going to start my career in the data domain as a data engineer. A selected few youtubers have been super inspirational and resourceful in this journey and you, Alex, you're the absolute favorite one.  Your videos, your content has been tremendously value adding, I enjoy watching all your videos on all the different segments and what I like the most about them is that they aren't intimidating. They are easy to follow, don't induce any imposter syndrome (Thank you for creating that video on impostor syndrome) and fuel my motivation to keep on trying with strong intent and honest efforts.  I couldn't thank you enough for the things you are doing and your work is adding value to a lot of people's lives in numerous ways. Keep up with the good work Sir. Keep creating, keep inspiring, keep growing  Wishing you all the best for your upcoming endeavors.",True
