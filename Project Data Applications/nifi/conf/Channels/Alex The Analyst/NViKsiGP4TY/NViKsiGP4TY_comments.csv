@user-yl1go5yd2c,2023-10-10T18:28:56Z,1,"So the SQL course was good up until a point. I did notice after watching your videos that Dataquest did teach some not-so-great habits (i.e: using a.ColumnName, b.ColumnName for joins). Also, if you do their excel courses, it is possible for other learners to access your work (even though they said it shouldn't be happening). I did have someone constantly coming in and deleting my data, which was frustrating for projects.",True
@Harishsulghar,2023-10-02T03:27:38Z,0,"Might help to get a new version of this video. Data quest has added tableau and power bi, along with other career paths now.",True
@zhalehmohammadalipour3542,2023-08-14T14:41:54Z,0,"However, Datacamp has some advantages, some of which are price and website layout which makes it preferable.",True
@zhalehmohammadalipour3542,2023-08-14T12:25:53Z,5,I did python basics before I hit the paywall in both dataquest and datacamp and I really prefer dataquest. In datacamp they skip many details as if you're supposded to know them but in dataquest they are all covered.,True
@murillomkra,2022-05-06T10:04:58Z,3,"My Dataquest experience has been horrible. Their payment system is full of bugs. I got charged wrongly and there is basically no customer support in Dataquest, not even a telephone number you can call. Plus they retained my credit card information without my consent after more than a year and I got a surprise bill. My tip is: stay away from this platform if you don't want headaches.",True
@christianafrica,2021-12-03T21:45:55Z,0,Is dataquests lifetime access for around $700 usd worth it or yearly subscription should do the trick? Please advise. Thanks.,True

@TjIrineu,2021-04-11T15:20:41Z,46,"I've used dataquest and Datacamp. I prefer dataquest because of two things. The first is personal, I'm a reading person. I'm not able to learn following videos.  But there is a different thing. Dataquest's career path are more cohesive.  Datacamp has multiple skill paths and they just combine them in some bigger career path. This create the following problem: In many moments, videos do not build in previous videos.  So, you may learn how to do something with a specific package, and then in the next set of videos, a different package is used or the re-explain a package already covered in other course.  In dataquest, as they have fewer paths, it seems that they are always buillding on top of previous courses. This is great for solidifying your knowledge.",True
@MrAdonis74,2021-03-08T05:31:05Z,23,"Usually, his videos have credibility. However, in this case, the video is too long and with too much guessing because he doesn‚Äôt have enough access to actually see the content. Consequently, he‚Äôs reviewing what he thinks is in the product.",True
