@alextreynker9698,2020-11-19T22:45:52Z,3,"Here are my two cents on this, this entire situation is completely ridicules! and I think companies and HR specifically is going to create a nightmare of scenario in 1 - 2 years time because they will need to rehire so many people and fast... and it will cost a lot of money to the companies.  People who are senior and have no other choice but to take these positions will be unhappy. They will feel that their were screwed over by companies who took advantage of the pandemic, and in turn will be the first to jump ship when the recovery will start. I assume recovery, specifically in the Data Analytics world will have a lot of demand as companies will need to process insane amount of data and fast. So instead of having a junior employee that will be with his natural career progression for about 2 - 4 years... employers will get unhappy staff that will change jobs in a heart beat for more money, again I assume would be around 6 - 12 months for good senior analysts. I backup my assumption by vaccines success rate and overall stock exchange recovery.   ***disclaimer - I'm currently finishing my data analyst courses (SQL, Excel, Python and Power BI) and trying to make a career change during all of this pandemic. 41 days to this wonderful year to go! whoohooo.... begone already! 😅",True
