@chanmeida1726,2023-02-28T16:16:01Z,0,Hi Alex. Is there any expiry date to the Google Data Analyst Certification? I ask because I heard most of the IT courses have a validity date of 1 - 2 years.,True

@Vintagetube310,2023-01-17T18:59:12Z,0,"Thank you so much Alex. I have one question. As I am gathering my portfolio with projects now, trying to display versatility with different types of projects, do you think it matters what projects you are displaying in your portfolio based on the industry you are applying to? For example. I have a covid based project, do you think applying to sports jobs would be relevant to show? I know having sports projects would be ideal but as you know, we can‚Äôt spend our entire time developing projects for every industry.   Keep up the great work!",True

@frederickzoreta6617,2022-10-03T01:04:33Z,11,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts on these guided projects.  I have been subscribed to Coursera Plus since May. I really like most of their guided projects.  When I saw this video 4 hours ago, I immediately did the Power BI for HR Analytics. After finishing it, I also did the 'Income Statement / Balance Sheet' with that same instructor. That 2nd course also includes 2 optional dashboard projects.  So in a little less than 2 hours, I created not 2, but 4 PBI dashboards and have also downloaded his data sets.  I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who wants to further build their portfolio ( like yours truly). :)  ** The instructor for these PBI projects also encourages the student to log in their emails using their cloud desktop so that you can submit those exact projects to potential employers/ clients.",True

I am on my analytics 8 class course working on the Capstone project right now... and while I feel like I have gotten a fairly intermediate exposure to multiple platforms I am at a loss getting started with this. I cannot ""see"" the clear picture of what I am supposed to be doing. But I think that if I do this first it will give me a ton of ""insight"" into how this process should work. I do realize that everyone is different and their processes will not always follow the same reasoning.. and also that this is a way for others to get a glimpse into your way of thinking (process per se) but I think this will be SO HELPFUL!!! so again...

@karimheras9462,2022-09-14T18:09:13Z,0,I really appreciate all the content you post on this subject it has been instrumental in me seeking a possible career change. I was wondering if you or anyone could provide any insight as to how attenable is it to get a job read in 3 or so months. A quick background about me I am a medical school grad but didn't complete residency to work as an MD. So I took the IT support course on Coursea and really enjoyed it and have been learning python for maybe 3 weeks now and I would like to jump into the tech world to find a job. And before I decide what steps to follow next I do want honest feedback as to what are the chances of someone with my background to actually make it into this industry. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.,True

@JohnRussell9,2022-09-14T10:16:55Z,0,"Thanks for the suggestions, Alex! Are there any Guided Portfolio projects you recommend for those working through the Google Data Analytics Certification? I know you have a few on your channel, but are there any you recommend from Coursera. I see the few you mentioned here use Python (whereas the Google DA program uses R), so if there's any that use R do let me know. As for Python, I want to learn that as well after completing the Google DA program. Is there a Coursera course you recommend? Sorry for the long winded comment and questions. üòÇ",True
