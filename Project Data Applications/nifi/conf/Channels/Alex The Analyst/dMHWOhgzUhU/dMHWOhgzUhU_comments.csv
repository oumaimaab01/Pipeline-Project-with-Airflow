@im5610,2021-06-08T12:32:09Z,0,"Hi Alex. We all hope that your wife had a good dinner time from last video,)  You give a lot of information what and how to prepare for tech interview. What to do about soft interview? When they asked you any kind of questions about analytics. It’s very important because when you come from different field even the question “what is the internet” can be a problem. How to stay smart and what should we know to pass it.  Thank you 😊",True

@shilpakarra9253,2021-06-08T12:03:41Z,3,"These are definitely some great inputs. As someone with 16 years of HR experience, I have suggested and guided potential job seekers through the process of applying for jobs. But as a Data Science enthusiast and currently as someone who is taking the Certification course from Coursera, this definitely sounds like a great piece of advice. I am still half way through the course and have a feeling that along side doing few personal projects, I should take up an internship first before I get into a job for better exposure and of course experience. Do you think it will be a good idea or should I try getting into jobs directly?",True
