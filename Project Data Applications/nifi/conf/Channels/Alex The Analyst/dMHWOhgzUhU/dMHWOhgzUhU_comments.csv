@shilpakarra9253,2021-06-08T12:03:41Z,3,"These are definitely some great inputs. As someone with 16 years of HR experience, I have suggested and guided potential job seekers through the process of applying for jobs. But as a Data Science enthusiast and currently as someone who is taking the Certification course from Coursera, this definitely sounds like a great piece of advice. I am still half way through the course and have a feeling that along side doing few personal projects, I should take up an internship first before I get into a job for better exposure and of course experience. Do you think it will be a good idea or should I try getting into jobs directly?",True
