@noctisarcanus7894,2023-11-17T06:01:02Z,0,I'd love to see your insights about getting into this field by studying an especific data related career vs migrating from other careers vs self-study. Each year new careers are created and that's kinda new and there are almost no people talking about it. I plan to study a 4-year career called Data Science Engineer (which also grants the academic degree of Data Analysis Superior Technician after the second year of study) where I live. I know there are some careers like that in the US. What do you think about it? I'm also taking online certifications because I really love this area of knowledge and I want a solid formation too. I'm even considering a Master in Statistics after that. Thank you for your amazing work. I've learnt a lot from you 😁 (Sorry for my English 😅),True
