For instance, many of us in business are hoping to learn which language is better for business analysis which, after all, is the trend in using either of these languages.   What we learn from the video is that R is being highlighted as useful in purely statistical analysis, while the comparison with Python does not provide any insights into Python's capabilities for statistical analysis. R is being highlighted as great for statistical analysis, however, advanced statistics is mostly used by the scientific and academic community mostly as well as sophisticated business environments whereby most of these advanced statistics are not needed in the general business world.  I would like to see the view from a business analyst/business intelligence professional who has truly used both R and Python for exactly the same purpose, using these languages for business analysis.

It has to be said that in my industry, I haven't yet come acress a Python user. It might just be that the big players in town are all either R or SAS background.",True

@arielleung3917,2021-02-17T10:13:08Z,5,"R and Python require totally different mindsets. Picking the better one of them is like asking ""which is a better career, statistician or engineer?"". With my mathematical background I find R code much more straightforward, and when I started to use Python, it's not like any single piece of code is unreadable but the entire workflow is unfamiliar: how tasks are broken down, why makes a copy here, and so on. It also took me quite some time to be convinced that Python does not have a library for the Spatio-Temporal Autoregression model (for a few hours I thought I just hadn't searched the right way) since R offers abundent solutions for spatio-temporal data. Eventually I realized that modelling is never at the top of engineers' priority list, and mathematicians/statisticians can focus on the intellectual work only because engineers have got their hands dirty. Also, Python makes it easier to collaborate with other platforms. If I were to communicate with laymen rather than other professionals in my company, deploying a dashboard or web app would be the best explanation. Again, it didn't occur to me because this hadn't been my top priority, so I preferred R. Now the job has changed and I'm using Python more often.",True

@ALZulas,2021-02-16T23:34:02Z,486,"I used to give a lecture on when to use R and when to use Python. I gave it for many years, but every year both languages would grow closer and closer together. I eventually stopped giving the lecture, because they're so much the same that it doesn't benefit students to talk about it anymore. The only thing that's different anymore, in my opinion, is it depends on how your brain thinks about problems. If you think about and solve problems from a programmer mind set, Python will be easier for you brain to wrap around. If you come from SAS, MPlus, or SPSS, R might be easier for your brain to wrap around. Much like picking skis or snowboards, try them both and go with the one that feels right for the way you work.",True

I will start on the first day of March and I am looking forward to it. I am studying for a master in Big Data at the same time and I am learning R there, whereas I need to learn Python for work. R doesn't look difficult to me but Python kinda looks more familiar for me and those with a background in other general purpose programming languages. I agree about the huge amount of libraries in R and I think that it is really great for visualization.
