@matt_milack,2023-10-10T12:10:35Z,1,I simply can't choose between becoming a data analyst and than striving to become a data engineer and becoming a sysadmin/network admin and than striving to become a SOC analyst/Cybersecurty analyst. At this point I wanna choose between the two based on which of these jobs will be more in demand in the future. I would really love to read an opinion of people who are reading this on the topic.,True
