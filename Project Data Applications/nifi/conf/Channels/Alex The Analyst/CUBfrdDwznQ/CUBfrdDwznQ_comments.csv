@SakuraWulf,2024-02-02T16:22:22Z,0,"I finished my Google IT Support Professional cert and after looking through job postings for entry level helpdesk roles, I noticed that data analyst pops up almost more than helpdesk, especially on careercircle. I've also been contacted by recruiters regarding my medical background to work in that field. I declined and after letting them know I was interested primarily in IT, they asked what roles specifically. They didn't seem to give much of a response when I said help desk (I'm guessing because it's easier to slot me into a medical role with my background and there are more ""qualified"" individuals for help desk they can consider) but it sounded like they were more familiar with or looking for Data Analyst roles compared to help desk.  Since the COMPTIA certs are arbitrarily expensive, especially the barrier to entry A+, I'll be going this route. I can't thank you enough for the resources you're offering to people looking to build their skillset in Data Analytics, Alex. I'm diving in.   EDIT: Cloud really isn't that hard to learn if you're tech savvy, if you were on the fence, it's just a lot of information to memorize and companies aren't going to offer you a role as a cloud consultant or architect/engineer without prior experience in IT either way, unless you have a strong reference.",True

I have been working for corporates and tech startups for 15 years  I currently hold a high position, manage a lot of poeple, making great money for my country's standard.  But I'm so tired of it.  Data analytics has caught my attention for a while, learned a bit of SQL, enjoy my limited excel skills.  I am 39, 3 kids.  Should I take the chance to make the switch? Too late? Too much baggage at risk?  Planning to learn 5-6 hours a per week, hope to get my first freelance gig in 4-5 months. Once I get used to it and understanding the supply and demand of data analytics, I plan to open up my own small data analytics shop.

@DarkGT,2023-03-02T21:50:07Z,3,"SQL  is hard, you can learn the basics in 3-4 days no doubts. Doing complicated things with SQL takes a lot more time. Make it 4-5 months min to master SQL only. Excel is tricky too. Some jobs ask for VBA and Excel, takes time to master Excel, let alone knowing the visual basic. Tableau or Power Bi. For my Power Bi certificate I had to reschedule the exam once. I didn't feel ready for it. The exam suggest that is for Junior analyst with 6 month experience. It's expected to have being working with Power Bi for at least that much before you get a professional certificate about it. It took me 4 months for the certificate btw and I barely passed it.  Where you place R or Python in that short time frame? Knowing Python first, then how to work with libraries doing the actual data work, then if you need web scrapping also learning that. Just won't happen in a short period of time or at least not in a job ready proficiency.",True

My non-traditional path to becoming a Data Analyst was completing two full-stack web dev bootcamps and then taking a contracting position as a Java dev where I never wrote any Java and was assigned analysis and reporting tasks lol. It's not my favorite, but there is a definite need for a DA/BI person on my current team and the company I am with seems to be fairly safe while other companies are having a lot of layoffs.   Overall I have begun to embrace my role and am looking forward to getting more hands on with Power BI. And with no previous professional coding experience, I guess I AM a DA now and my resume should reflect that. Kind of a bummer to push my web dev projects down the list, but it is probably for the best. Hmm not the worst decisions in the world to have to make.

@iAM2AM,2023-02-07T16:48:30Z,0,"Imagine a world where the tech industry has gotten so bloated that you can't even just apply for a job and submit a resume anymore. Step 1) Build your resume. Step 2) Don't include your life. Just the parts the recruiter cares about. Your experience outside of their concerns don't matter much. For in tech, you're not human. You're the product that makes the product. Step 3) Reach out to recruiters. Because being good at something isn't enough anymore. Thousands of people are good at things. Nowadays, you have to show a lot of things that have nothing to do with the job itself and only prove to exclude highly talented people who test and interview poorly but are more capable than the valedictorian extroverts they hire. Personality has nothing to do with work. At all. Ever. Work from home people proved that. Answering a bunch of non-sensacle questions in an interview with some egotistical hiring manager who asks stupid questions like: ""You're stuck in a room with a green balloon and a red light. What do you do?""  At this point, I just interview to waste people's time. If I get it. Great. If not. So what. Ask me a dumb question? My response is always the same: ""Make fun of you for asking a stupid question that has nothing to do with this interview or the job I applied for. That's step one. Step two: Pop the balloon. Next question please.""",True

I‚Äôve been working on more case studies and I‚Äôm eager to start applying. However, do jobs offer any sort of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll train you more‚Äù if you show you have a good beginner level understanding or is you‚Äôre expected to just go right on in with little help?   I know you‚Äôve said back in the day you didn‚Äôt have much technical skills but one of your jobs liked your personality and thought ‚Äúwe can train him‚Äù. Do you still think that is pretty prevalent today? Or is there more of an expectation, regardless of background knowledge, that you‚Äôll come in and just take your spot.",True

@Gudha_Ismintis,2023-01-31T13:26:24Z,1,hi Alex - thanks for these - i am in an unusual sitiution where i am working an entry level rolein a global firm but because nobody is doing my role elsewhere in the firm - I have the unusual flexibility of making the role 'my own' - and as such i am angling it towards being a data analyst. I currently cannot download any software for my machine so - would you be able to make a video for this type of situation? 1. how to talk to IT about needing to install SQL 2. How to find out what my IT uses as a relational database? etc - would be great if you could make a video for this type of scenario - and potentially add your own recommendations in how to turn an existing role into a Data Analyst whilst being on good terms with the firms IT department whilst working independently as a Data Analyst impressing your line manager with how productive you have been in setting yourself up independently within the new role you are creating - Hope that makes sense,True
