@magdalenekimani8549,2024-01-14T16:39:41Z,2,I love the fact that you remind us to talk it out loud and walk the interviewer through what we are doing. That's what sets us apart from the rest.,True

@reliablevariable1615,2024-01-02T23:26:21Z,1,"Great video! One thing I would add is that not all interviewees will get a chance to live code as part of their interview process; some will only send this question to you as a take-home. The expectation, then, is to send back the query (unless the questions explicitly ask you to elaborate more on your thought process). In this basic query, though, the comments should suffice in succinctly conveying the thought process.  I was lucky enough to have a senior data analyst go back-and-forth with me to learn SQL. To be fair, it was SQL Developer, which is a less ""conventional"" SQL language...",True
@newenglandnomad9405,2024-01-02T18:33:43Z,1,"My question is, i understand the queries you wrote, what I don't understand are the real world use. I also understand that you're showing really simple csv files, and the real purpose of sql is that you might have a million lines of data.  For finance, would your boss maybe ask you to find the customers that earned over 5% in their portfolio in 2023 or how many people over 67 starting withdrawing from their Roth IRA?    I get the simplicity you're trying to show, I'm just curious about real world use.",True
@malcorub,2024-01-02T18:01:27Z,0,"I will have to try Analyst Builder out.  Recently I had a PostGre SQL technical test (after applying but before any interview) thru CODILITY and absolutely hated the platform so much so it was throwing me off, and I've been using SQL Server and SAS for years.   It wouldn't even allow me to SELECT * FROM TABLE to see the initial data set, basically the system seemed like I would only be allowed to enter the final solution without working my way thru it.",True

@BeanWorks91,2024-01-02T15:24:36Z,3,I am such a huge fan of your comments in the editor.   Plus the concept of ‚Äúexplaining your thought process to the technical interviewer‚Äù.   Great way by build the confidence as well if you actually know the theory behind what you are doing üéâ,True
