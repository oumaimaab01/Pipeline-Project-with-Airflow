@horacezhen,2020-12-24T09:02:36Z,2,"Hey I am a fresh grad just find out your channel. Just got out of university with a stat and econ major during the pandemic. When I was in the job search, I found that lots of skills required for junior level data analyst were not taught in school. I have only worked with R using tidyverse + ggplot2. But python definitely have a edge over R in real life work. After watching your videos, I am much more confident that if I switch to python with panda + tableau/power Bi, I will eventually get DA position to start my career. Please keep doing more videos! I love your insights about DA, and they’re super helpful for those of us with a statistics degree but don’t have skills to meet the DA job requirements. Thank you.",True

@chaitanyasri8090,2020-11-11T12:26:51Z,1,"Hi Alex. A very very big thanks to you from my side I have learnt python and am very confused in choosing the correct path using python to work with like is it data science field or developer field. At that time only i have seen your video data scientist vs data analyst then i have got the clarity that I should go for data analyst and from then I have been watching every video of yours which is very informative. Thank so much for that   I have one question for you i have learnt pandas, numpy ,MySQL, tableau for now can I apply for the data analyst jobs on the sites or should I wait till I learn everything like matplotlib,statistics,regular expressions, string manipulation, story telling etc. some other topics please give your valuable suggestion .  Thanks",True
