@rociob702,2022-05-22T02:18:36Z,6,"Thank you for this video very helpful really! Some feedback though, I wish this was easier to follow along with my IOS device. One thing I'm missing out on is how amazingly simple Microsoft products make it to manipulate something like the Filter option you have on the side of the chart. My mac does not have that option sadly so I keep having to teach myself where things are located. Also, I cannot see descriptions once hovering over something with my mouse. Any ideas on how this might be a better experience for learning the material? Any settings I can alter to make things smoother for me? Thanks!",True
