From my understanding, the function subtracts the production cost from the price of each product and multiples it by the total number of units sold (in this case 3001). Shouldn't we multiply by the number of products that sold for each unit. For example Nylon Rope's were sold 390 times and the profit for each nylon rope is $17.32. So wouldn't the total profit for Nylon Ropes be $17.32 x 390 which is $6754.80. The function is mutliplying $17.32 by 3001 which is $51977.32.",True

On to the main point, I think you might have made some mistakes with the SUM and SUMX while calculating the profit for each product, as well as the table for the amount of profit each customer has made you in the reports section.   1:  For the Profit column in the Apocalypse Store table, consider using the DAX Function ""('Apocolypse Store'[Price]-'Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost]) * [Units Sold]"" Where the [Units Sold] in the DAX function is a measure that contains the DAX function ""SUM('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])"".   2:  As for the table that contains the profit earned from each customer, I suggest you try the DAX function ""SUMX('Apocolypse Sales', 'Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold] * (RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - RELATED('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])))"" which returns the correct profits earned from each customer.

@SKapadnis7869,2023-10-19T21:37:08Z,1,"Hey Alex, I got different results for the profits when I broke it down by the Product. So I figured that your formula was multiplying by total units = 3001 instead of individual units sold for each product. To solve that, I created two separate profit formulae under Aplocolypse store table  for simplicity. The first one was this: Unitary Profit = SUMX('Apocolypse Store',('Apocolypse Store'[Price]) - ('Apocolypse Store'[Production Cost])) and the second one was this: Total Profit = SUMX('Apocolypse Sales',('Apocolypse Store'[Unitary Profit])*('Apocolypse Sales'[Units Sold])). The math seemed to have worked out when I used these in the visualization tables. Ex. Unitary profit for backpack is 13.07 and units sold is 212 so total Profit for backpack = $2770.84. My profit for all products came out to be $43,212.43",True

@TheDavesterist,2023-03-14T20:13:17Z,22,Hey Alex. I hope you get to read this. The profit that was calculated with SUMX is incorrect. You multiplied the profit of each product with the sum of all products sold instead of the sum of each individual product.  I made a separate column in apocalypse store table and made it equal to the measure [Sum of Products Sold] that was done earlier in the video. That gives the correct amount of product sold for each product and named it Products_Sold. Then I used that column to multiply it to the profit. So in a new column I put ([Price] - [Production Cost]) * [Products_Sold]. That will give you the correct profit.,True
