@dark-hobbit,2021-04-06T11:28:28Z,0,"You and cauliflower are teaching me English vocab for vegetables quite well! I had no idea what that is despite really liking it xD  Btw, there's one other and very big thing that people often forget to take into account. Machines glitch. They glitch a lot. No matter how good your IT department is.  For example, where I currently work as an intern we have a lot of standartised reports automated. Analysts basically just need to prepare the data to fit a specific template, and then the robots can prepare all the reports for us. However, with every new update to the report templates and/or the robots there are inevitably a bunch of new bugs, including robots preparing certain reports incorrectly or refusing to prepare them at all. And sure, sooner or later the tech guys are going to fix it (until something new breaks, at least), but when push comes to shove and our deadlines are close (which they constantly are), it is up to the analysts to actually do everything by hand until the robots get fixed. And that's why, despite all the automatisation, we're still needed at the job.",True

@TheJanstyler,2021-03-26T16:15:19Z,1,"So a question about the Automation of Data Analysis (Edit: And about the future of Data Analysis as a career in general):   Like I commented under another of your videos, I'm trying to find a different career path to get out of being an electrician. Data Analysis really seem like it might be what I will be going for in the very near future. My question now is, considering the maybe/maybe not automation of the job in the future do you think it would be worth it to get into the industry? And do you think that in the future with automation ramping up the will be as good money wise as it is right now? I'm currently 24 and depending on how much money I make I plan to work until I am at least 60. The thing is that I don't know that much about the industry and want to prevent myself from entering a possible career path that wouldn't last me as long. Granted, if I work as a Data Analyst for such a long time I might find opportunities to branch of into a different direction, but right now I'm solely looking at the case of me doing the same job / going the same direction until I retire.

@JoeG2324,2021-03-19T23:12:22Z,9,"I'm thinking about my job and how complex the business is and I'm not sure AI can fully replace what I do. Our business has 1000s of tables with complex relationships that are very complex in nature. Our orders table, for example,  has billions of records with information on taxing, discounts, products etc... that all relate to other objects. I'm starting to think about all the views and tables we create for reporting needs and all the complex logic and SQL that goes into creating these views and I just don't see how that can be fully automated without a human being involved. Can the AI and human work together. Sure, but the AI on its own doesn't sound like it can work. After the data has been massaged and transformed there are so many ways to interpret the results that you couldn't possibly rely on just AI for that without human intervention. I think the two will ultimately work together and nobody has to freak out about AI replacing any jobs.",True
@joshi1q2w3e,2021-03-19T18:43:37Z,4,I think people also confuse “Automation” with “Artificial General intelligence” which from my understanding are two very different things.   At a certain point if a large majority of jobs get “automated” and it puts a large amount of people out of work then who will be left to actually buy stuff?   I highly doubt all those articles about “universal income” Governments already tax the hell out of us. I can’t see them just giving a large amount of the population a decent amount of money every month.,True
