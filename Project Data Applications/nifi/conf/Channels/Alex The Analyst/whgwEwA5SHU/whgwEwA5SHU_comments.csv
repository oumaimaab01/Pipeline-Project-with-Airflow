@parkerandrecreation,2021-07-31T05:10:43Z,0,I agree that you should be able to ask this. This can backfire sometimes unfortunately though. I was about to move to another company once and then my current company offered me $2 more per hour. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to hide that information from my 3 coworkers and if I didn‚Äôt go into details on why I‚Äôm staying instead of going to the other place I was excited to go to then it would seem suspicious. My current manager got on my case a week later because during our raise evaluation my coworkers asked for more because of the offer they gave me. The $2 increase actually brought me up to my coworker who‚Äôd been there a few years longer and she was upset about it.,True
@dark-hobbit,2021-03-19T10:10:54Z,0,"Meat-stuffed tomatoes with cheese on top and baked in the oven are the best! Take some tomatoes (preferably big-ish) and cut off the tops. Scoop the centre out with a spoon and fill it with grounded meat (or grounded meat mixed with rice, as I do), then cover with some grated cheese on top. Ideally, your meat should be up to around the tomato's top and the cheese somewhat over it, so everything bakes nicely and the tomato doesn't get too dry. Then stuff it into a preheated oven and cook until all looks good to eat! Will probably take around 20 minutes depending on the oven's temperature and how big the tomatoes are.  And the recipe can be adjusted however you want - take bigger tomatoes if you want to put more meat inside, or cover with a lot of cheese if that's your thing, or have a lot of small tomatoes if you're mostly in it for the veggies. Very juicy, very tasty and very easy to make!",True

@wilsonman8661,2020-12-10T20:43:16Z,1,"... Yeah, I do this too. I'll straight up ask anybody anything though so I've never felt any apprehension. I've also had pretty good success because I'm just a very open person in general and people know I'll also answer virtually any question.  I will say though, in my opinion, what other people are making is virtually irrelevant to what you're making. Other people making more than you is not really a good argument for why you should make more. It doesn't really say anything about *your* skills and contributions, per se. YMMV  P.S: Lasagna is great, but pizza is far and away the best. Unless you put pineapple on it. ;)",True

The new intro is impressive, i asked you last time and you didn't see it; if someone has the skill, the course on coursera of that skill is a waste of time, is that correct? and finally we have pasta with tomato on the menu of this week, but there is a claim that said that tomato is a fruit. what do you think about it?",True

@joshi1q2w3e,2020-12-10T14:49:07Z,6,"I wish more people understood that Discussing your salary with your coworkers only helps the both of you to make sure the company doesn‚Äôt underpay you.   Most Companies don‚Äôt want employees discussing their salaries with each other because it enables the company to pay people who are doing the same work differently. Many times newer people get paid more because it cost more to hire someone away from another company, their skills could be better, etc.   Many people may think that if they do above average work that their salary is probably more than their peers and don‚Äôt want to share their salary to avoid jealousy or whatever other reason but most of the time companies are trying to pay you the least they can for the maximum amount of high quality work they can squeeze out of you.   One argument I‚Äôve heard is that ‚ÄúHigh Performers‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt share their salary because the company may pay them more than their peers doing the same job and them sharing their salary could cause conflict in the workplace; maybe even make management unhappy with them.   However, In my experience too many people think they‚Äôre ‚Äúhigh performers‚Äù when they‚Äôre not. We always tend to think the best of ourself and are more critical about other people than we are for ourselves.   In some cases high performers do get paid more but they have to truly bring significant Value to the company. By value i mean they increase productivity, cut significant costs, or increase revenue significantly.",True
