@TheCazz10,2020-11-03T21:15:09Z,3,"Hi Alex, I work in banking and plan to get a data analyst role in that industry. I think for me SAS is higher on the list than Python. I hear it‚Äôs not too difficult to learn.",True
@sakirinteser9536,2020-11-03T20:11:27Z,1,Can you please explain or make a video on how to show SQL reports on Excel? I'm a beginner and I know both SQL and Excel but i'm not sure how to connect these two together.,True
@davidchait367,2020-11-03T20:07:07Z,2,Great video! Thanks!   A question for you: you didn't mention Power BI as a skill that you need in EXCEL.  How come?  Another question: another topic for a quick little video: the difference between a data analyst and a business analyst (skillwise).  Perhaps my two questions are related? Is Power BI chiefly of interest to business analysts?,True

@enriquecortines5522,2020-11-03T19:23:22Z,3,"I agree 100% with this. I would add, from personal experience, that in SQL you should also learn query performance so that your queries run faster and maybe optional or more advanced,  partitions and indexes",True
@kalpeshghadigaonkar3388,2020-11-03T19:12:31Z,155,I am a data analyst and the all points mentioned by Alex are 100% true. I use these in my current role.  1 - All the data is stored in databases and SQL is used to extract it.  2 - The extracted data is put into excel and presented to other teams 3 - Connecting SQL to Python is also handy.  4 - Pandas should be the first priority when it comes to Python libraries.,True

So now I am focused more on learning advanced Excel instead of having portfolio projects in Tableau.  Great video as always, Alex!",True
