@anelnp,2020-04-11T22:34:57Z,5,"Can waiting around for other people to send you things in order to be able to do your job reflect negatively on your performance?  Do your supervisors generally understand the situation and are fine with submitting the work last minute?  Does it also make you feel stressed out that you won't be able to submit something on time because you waisted 3 days doing nothing and have everything left for the last few hours?  Are there days where you are just looking at the clock waiting to go home because you don't have anything to do, or are you always working on multiple projects at the same time so there is always some deadline that you are focused on?",True
