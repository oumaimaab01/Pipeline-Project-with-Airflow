@Helmofthedominator25,2024-03-28T19:56:12Z,0,"Kelly's 3rd Purchase. That code is working only if the customers don`t have the 6th purchase, to solve that problem you need to write the correction in code like when the row_number is = 3 then it must restart and begin again from 1 to 3, and on and on and on and on. Sample code :  WITH CTE AS  ( SELECT *, (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_id )-1) % 3 + 1 AS third_transaction FROM purchases ) SELECT customer_id, transaction_id, amount, (amount - amount *0.33) AS discounted_amount FROM CTE WHERE third_transaction = 3",True
@malcorub,2024-02-20T04:39:41Z,0,"I solved it like this in SSMS.  But I don't think temp tables are allowed in Analyst Builder.

@Bobthetomado,2024-02-05T14:22:17Z,2,"I've ran into similar problems of StrataScratch, but the Analyst Builder question should be a bit more clear on if the discount only applies to the 3rd transaction ever made, or every 3 transactions.",True

@StandbyxP,2024-01-12T18:36:02Z,1,"Great video as always Alex! Just one question since I am still learning: Does the ""DATEDIFF(t1.date, t2.date) = 1"" always mean 1 day difference? Because I thought it is mandatory to put an intervall before putting (start_date,end_date) inside the parenthesis of DATEDIFF(), to determine if you want year, month, day etc. as difference.",True

@Nyrus62,2024-01-10T21:31:46Z,1,"Alex! Your content has been so huge in my journey to become a data analyst.   I‚Äôm working on doing some projects and putting together my portfolio, but man it‚Äôs so hard to put all of the skills together and know what to do and when to use certain tools.   I‚Äôm starting to get some of those valley of despair feelings. Do you, or anyone else for that matter, have any advice or tips on getting through knowing the technical skills but not knowing how to implement them?",True

@dianadennis7225,2024-01-09T23:48:20Z,0,re: Q2 shouldn't filter in the ON clause; the ON clause should only include join criteria. Poor practice and readability matter at this level,True

@AltF4Esc,2024-01-09T14:39:34Z,0,"I love this, but you should show every third purchase. The 1st 3rd purchase wont get you very far.  Where mod(row_num, 3) = 0 Mod returns the remainder of long division",True
