@melissavoda3730,2023-03-03T19:57:17Z,0,"I missed the live stream, but watched everything you had to say.   Iâ€™m actually just starting the whole transition from graphic designer to data analyst. I feel that one of the harder things for me would be how to re-word my resume into a data resume when all my experience is definitely not data related. The only tool that comes close is excel, and that was just pulling reports from a program and uploading the file to the cloud.  So Iâ€™m just unsure of how I should go about that, but maybe your future video will touch upon that.  Other than that, I look forward to you future videos and alllll the ones in the boot camp playlist!",True

@Prasadavajjhala,2023-03-03T02:51:16Z,0,"Hi Alex,Â   I was hoping to be online during your session but found it difficult to stay awake until 1 am ( local time).  Question i wanted to askÂ :  Â how much knowledge should i know in Tableau prior to learning Power BI.Â I have completed two courses in Tableau (Kirills, A-Z, & advanced) on Udemy. I have worked on your portfolio projects and about to work on the coursera portfolio ones you have discussed on youtube. I have been listening to the various Tableau user groups and realised how complex it can get. I am planning to get to the advanced level as it opens up a heap opportunities. Is it practical to learn both to an an advanced level. A big thank you for your mentorship on the channel, Prasad",True
