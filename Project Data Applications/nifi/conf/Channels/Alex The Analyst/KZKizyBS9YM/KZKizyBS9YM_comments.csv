@rarepepecombos8743,2024-01-16T04:37:21Z,0,"Alex can you please answer my question, I am an undergrad with experience in a bit of basic statistics and sql. I want to join WGU MSDA (Masters in Data Analytics). Do I need more difficult math skills beyond basic statistics (Chi square test, standard deviation).",True
@user-pk9qn6om5s,2024-01-15T22:55:55Z,0,By doing your SQL  course will I be able to answer the very hard questions?,True
@reliablevariable1615,2024-01-15T18:09:02Z,0,"My immediate concern was the leading spaces when you wrote the query! So glad you addressed it. Once I write a query that accounts for a leading or trailing space, the immediate question I would ask if I need to account for it in the output. If the answer is yes, I address it immediately once I have figured out the query so I don't forget. If you really want it tricky, you'd throw in an address or two with dashes in the city or address. But that's be a very very hard video as opposed to a very hard video. Throw in foreign addresses and you'd get darn near impossible lol",True
@eren_1oglu,2024-01-12T13:46:11Z,0,I started to learn SQL earlier but had to pause for a while because of school... Now I'm starting again. Thanks for these tutorials and real-life examples,True
