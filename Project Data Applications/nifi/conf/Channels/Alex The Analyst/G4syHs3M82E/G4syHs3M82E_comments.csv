@diceymaan,2024-04-07T21:36:44Z,0,"For you who are googling for this and get hinged on the salary, it's good to remember that these are mostly US salary levels. For example, in Switzerland, a Business Analyst & Data Analyst make the same salary from junior through to mid, but in senior the Business Analyst is actually earning more. So, check out stuff like that depending on where you live, because this has a lot to do with demand and supply. Some countries have more business analysts and some more data analysts, though at the end of the day, these are in demand in most countries and you'll probably make a really good earning.",True

Our DA don't know how the data correlates to the departments job because they get data orders from many departments all over the country!

@martramT,2021-06-14T14:06:34Z,1,"Hi, I got your video recommended by YouTube, and I wanted to point out something that is not known about my field which definitely touch the business analyst ""job"" or at least a major part of it.  I have a masters degree as an ""ergonomist""(often previously called human factor specialist) or more specifically in my case software ergonomist (which is often divided in UX researcher and UX designer, which can take many shapes, often watered down versions and more oriented towards production)  All the bullet points mentioned about the business analysts role are covered by ergonomics specialists, which as a focus in methodological research, limiting biases, and to iterate to propose the best user/client-centered solutions.  -Work with clients to understand the problems/ Use current data to understand the problems:  We can do various techniques depending of the context and availability,  from shadowing/field observation (we watch and record the user or potential user do his tasks in his context, with or without a current product), individual interviews (controlled discussions recorded with either targeted or open questions, trying to understand the context, irritants, various potential needs), questionnaires (for broader groups, targeted questions, etc.), usability tests(on real product or prototype with planned scenarios and measures), and others.  all those are analyzed to assess problems, points that can be improved, to find opportunities for the business and/or the product present and future.  - Outline and communicate the client's requirements to the team: We do this with analysis documents with recommendations and if it applies with static or interactive prototypes (in software.. there's also organizational ergonomics, physical ergonomics, environmental ergonomics, as consultants, in an office..) We share our findings with managers, clients and/or the programming team. This leads to actual solutions being developed.   The difference here with business analysts is our studies aren't in business or management, we are not focused on finances of the business, even though we claim that our methodology can save businesses a lot of money and employee ressources, and can lead to more usable and more targeted solutions.  We are specialists in research (limiting biases, from hierarchy, from groups, avoiding false-good-ideas and anecdotal informations as much as possible for example). We are also specialists in the fields the solutions will be made for.  As a software ergonomics, I'm specialized in research (what shape should have an interview, pros and cons of various format and when to apply them, why context is important), cognition (how we process information, how we behave in certain conditions) and some physical aspects of the human body (understanding some limitations), and human-computer interfaces, the interaction with the system, the bests practices, what is confusing what is clear, what should be done in X situations, the differences between a range of various components that could seem to achieve the same goal for unaware people.  As you may understand, a large part of this is very high level, we do the research quite some time before any programmers will touch the solution. Our solutions could even reshape roles in an organization if the context allows it.  Our solutions can go to the finer details of a final product, even though usually  other specialists will focus on the esthetics, and other people will code/build it, since both those role have an impact on the usage of the final product, we can be part of the whole process.  Anyhow, I thought it would be good to share this as our role is often misunderstood in companies. Thanks for reading!",True

This takes years, obviously... it can take 3-7 years to do what I'm talking about... and it never ends. I'd say that's worth more than any degree I would have gotten 20 years ago.
