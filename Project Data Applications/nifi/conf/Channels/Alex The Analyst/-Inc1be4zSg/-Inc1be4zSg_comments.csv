@sapnanayak1453,2023-06-14T05:04:26Z,0,Could you make a video on how to get a data analyst job in a domain you don't have any experience in. This could be because the domain in not the degree I have and/or literal job experience. I feel that a lot the recruiters usually tend to skip or give lesser importance to your job application because of it.,True

@michaellilly2550,2022-02-12T04:14:05Z,0,"Hi Alex, found your channel two weeks ago (5 reasons not to be a data analyst was the first video of yours that I saw). I am just beginning the process of learning SQL and the other skills you highlight so I can change careers (25 years in retail grocery as a cashier) and live in a suburb of ATL.  I'd like to ask about the following situation: what are your thoughts about contract or contract-to-hire or gig jobs appearing on an application for someone looking for that first Jr Data Analyst position who has no other experience other than cashierintmg? Is seeing a bunch of temporary contract work a plus or a minus on an application,  when applying for that full time job. (I have a particular domestic situation that keeps me tied to retail)",True

I wanted a piece of advice and it would be an honor to get an advice from you. I am just starting out in this field, i.e I am learning skills right now.

@gothunder7208,2021-04-12T04:57:48Z,0,"I was offered an on-site nterview this Thursday after 5 days I applied. Is it a good sign? It's a data analytics/report writer position of a hospital in a REALLY small town. Am I expected to do any coding interview? What questions should I expect with the job requirements below? I have no experience in data analyst work experience. I know SQL (took DB management class in undergrad) and some web development (graduated from bachelor's last year).   ""Minimum Work Experience: A minimum of 2-3 years‚Äô experience with Microsoft SQL preferred. Microsoft Access and other database systems a plus. Proficient with Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office Products preferred. Moderate experience with a Microsoft-based programming language (Python,Javascript etc) a plus.""  Thank you!",True

@taylorbosier,2020-09-03T21:06:53Z,1,"Informative. Lighting, audio, and camera are crisp. Clothing and background don't matter so long as the material is good, which it is! I think hearing about the other sides' perspective is informative and gears up the listener who is seeking advice. At moments, it seemed like the conversation tailed off track but in this long format it feels more organic than just reading off a script. From my studies, professors who walk in with bullet points and ensure they covered the bullet points in the 45 minute setting did a way better job teaching than those who came in with a full on script. Thanks for mixing it up!",True
