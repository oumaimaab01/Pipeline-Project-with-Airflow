For instance, could you replace IBM Data Analytics with the Google Advanced Data Analytics and the Business Intelligence course?  I've just started my journey into analytics with the Digital marketing course and now the Google Analytics course.  Followed by the advanced Analytics and Business Intelligence when I get to it.",True
@TrundleTheGreat,2023-12-19T11:15:42Z,0,"I wish the IBM one was included in Coursera Plus, but none of the IBM courses are, unfortunately. I had most of these bookmarked already but added the last one for Tableau. I decided getting the Plus was the better option since I completed the Google Data Analytics in just over 4 weeks. I figure it'd be a waste of money to end up paying for a second entire month if I finish in 5 -6 weeks.   There is a Tableau Business Intelligence Analyst one too that looks like it will be fun to learn.",True

@travissmith383,2023-11-12T07:42:56Z,0,Coursera sucks!  Learned more about SQL/PYTHON in 3 weeks at Udemy than 4 to 5 months with Cousera.    Plus:  You actually own the course and review it unlimited times vs paying a monthly fee.  Less than $250 you can learn all the skills you need get started as a data analyst or programmer.    You can always list those certifications from Coursera on your resume as employers will not check.   Wasted my money/time with Coursera.,True
