@user-mo6jk9vc5t,2024-01-12T04:02:58Z,2,"Hello, I am a fan in Chinese Mainland. My name is Victor Joe, and I like your video very much. In China, because of the existence of the national wall of fire, many people cannot access Youtube, so I want to translate your video into Chinese and put it on video websites that can be accessed in China, so that more Chinese friends can see your high-quality video. I sincerely request your authorization. Do you think it is OK?",True
@sj1795,2024-01-01T22:29:58Z,11,"I'm not going to lie. I've LOVED all your videos up until the Pandas series. I've really been struggling; not because of you, because of me. Alex you're a gem. The ONLY reason I'm making it through Pandas is because of your instructions, which are always so clear and easy to follow.   As I've worked my way through your bootcamp series I've discovered that the process of coding is like learning all new things. You have ebbs and flows where it's a real struggle as you learn the new material, then you reach one mountain top and get super excited because the material finally ""clicks"", and then you're back at the bottom climbing another mountain. lol I know pandas and numpy are extremely important concepts to grasp in Python. I'm just struggling along waiting for them to ""click"". However, you make it soooo worth the struggle. I've learned SO MUCH already. I appreciate YOU. As always, THANK YOU!!",True

@user-sh7kk6gn8m,2023-05-11T01:19:14Z,0,"How would you visualize categorical data on a bar graph? For example, I have a dataset of people's genders and whether they like an ice cream flavor or not. The x axis would be the flavors (chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla). The y axis would be the count of true and false responses. So each flavor would have two ""bars"" on the graph.",True
@khalafmanaseer3386,2023-05-09T17:09:52Z,1,"I don't understand why someone needs Pandas when they have Tableau and PowerBI (unless they had to)  I mean, if you have easy tool like excel to build, manipulate and create charts and reports, you don't go to SQL unless you were dealing with huge data which isn't the case in 95% of the time üòÖ",True
