@PhilipJohnson-zh5sy,2024-05-27T11:52:02Z,0,"Thank you so much Alex straight to the point and simple. Grateful for you. Please is there a video where you show an example of sub-queries and aliasing. Using the right alias at the different levels of nesting. For example  Select emp.*  From         (select a.*          From                 ( select col1,... col1                  from employees as emp)  as a where .... ) as vw_emps_without_a   I believe in this case saying select emps.* on the first line is wrong the correct thing to use will be vw_emps_without_a.*.  This will make more sense as to why aliasing if JOINS where involved, this is just a shortened example.",True

@grandetaco4416,2024-02-16T01:04:58Z,0,"I disagree on your opinion on lettering joins. The reason being is that if my join list gets to be 5, 6, 7 tables then I have an idea of where the table is in the join list as long as I adhere to that alphabetic order. So if I see my column is in table D or E then I can quickly look down the list to find that table. The alias does not readily tell you what the table's full name and path are. What if you have similarly named tables in more than one schema? What if you are not familiar with these tables. If I letter them I can quickly figure out where in my join I put the table. I've also run into enough issues where too many of the tables are named almost identically.  I also think that putting too many letters in your alias also defeats the purpose of aliases. Aliases are there to clean up the code and shorten the column names. I can see renaming later after you've developed it, but when trying to code all of this it clears confusion as to where the join is.",True

@akashnidgundi61,2023-10-21T16:14:08Z,1,"Just a small tip, Aliases can't be used as a filter condition in the WHERE clause. Ex: let's say you merge first_name and last_name and name the column as full_name, you cant go like, WHERE full_name like '%A' (full_name starting with A),   IT WONT WORK. but, it works with Order By.
