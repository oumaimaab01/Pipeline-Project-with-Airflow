@stillmattwest,2024-04-04T13:08:00Z,0,"I just finished week one of this course. There is definitely some math! If you're like me and its been a minute since you've really had to work through an equation, I would advise just slowing down and making sure you understand what you're looking at before moving on because each step builds on the last.   Andrew Ng is a very good teacher, which is what makes the class work. ChatGPT is also good as an echo chamber. Try to explain the math to it, it will correct you if you get something wrong.",True

I just accepted a position of a administrative analyst and I like it so far, but I can't find much about others in this position. I don't get paid much ($17)but I'm okay with that for now because I'm entry and graduated with a BS in community health in 2020 and went from a screener,to medical records to my current position at the same clinic location. Where should I start to leverage on my new position of administrative analyst. I'm so sorry for the long comment and grammar but I'm searching for a sense of direction I desperately want to take this small opportunity and grow and I'm afraid that I might because stagnant. 2020 really did a number on my confidence in job hunting and how I'm perceived in the market because I was constantly turned down and overlook for things I felt like I was qualified for.",True
