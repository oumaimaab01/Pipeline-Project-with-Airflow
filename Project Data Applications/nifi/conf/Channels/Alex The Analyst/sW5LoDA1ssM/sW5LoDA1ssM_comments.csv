@jbonesmooth2050,2024-05-20T21:50:16Z,0,"Hey Alex, would you know if it’s possible to have multiple active relationships for the same variable? My case is as follows: I have a SF object called projects which represent a business deal. The project has fields for multiple participants, such as buyer’s attorney and seller’s attorney which can be populated with an “organization” object. I’m trying to create a table that shows the 7 participant types across a project where I can use a single slicer and type in a single name (ex: XYZ Law Firm) and I can see all the projects they’re associated with regardless of role.  How could I set these relationships up? Also, the results in the columns currently only show the SF ID value of the org, not the name",True
