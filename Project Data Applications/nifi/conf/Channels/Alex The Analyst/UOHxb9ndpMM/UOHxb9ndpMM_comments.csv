@Mister_Garibaldi,2023-08-28T17:09:05Z,3,"I'm a hands-on Manager. Honestly, I have been frustrated with limitations I could not break through as an analyst, and even now I'm gunning for Senior Manager, partly because I am pretty sure I'll be able to break through more barriers. I'm still ""building things"", it's just more things and bigger things, and I'm not the only one doing the building.",True
