@BruceNJeffAreMyFlies,2022-09-12T05:59:22Z,0,"Regarding the broad scope at 19:00 ; I have similar desires to what is being described here. YES, data science is a HUGE field, but I am not yet certain on what path I want to take, and I don't think I will be certain for a long time. I want to work anywhere in the field and find my place, so I am starting with analytics, but I would accept entry level for any field within data sciences. Entry data engineer? Sign me up. Entry data analyst? Yes please. Entry data scientist? Well you probably won't hire me, but I'd love that too!",True
