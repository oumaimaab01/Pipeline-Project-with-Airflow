@veronicab2096,2022-12-20T20:21:57Z,0,"I agree with one of your viewers (the Target Data Analyst) in that learning a new domain is the hardest part of changing careers to data analytics. I‚Äôm in manufacturing value chain analytics using SAP and I know nothing about manufacturing or value chain whatsoever. I can get the tech part (SAP) of the job quickly because the Internet is full of educational content, but there are not value chain or manufacturing crash courses out there. I‚Äôm learning on the job and I feel so behind the curve!",True

This could honestly be a video all on its own  I've seen some reports that go to people super high up that are still in excel with like pivots and excel charts because that's what people are comfortable with   And I've made solutions for teams that couldn't figure out how to make a few simple formulas in excel,True

However I'm wondering, I landed an L1 Data & Analytics Platform Support Engineer, would this be the same as other entry-level Data Analyst positions you've mentioned? Any suggestions as to how should be my mindset in taking this job? I'm working fully remote for an Egyptian Digital Transformation Company and I'm just ecstatic that I landed this job.
