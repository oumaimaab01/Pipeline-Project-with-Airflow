@Cameron_David_,2023-09-20T20:22:57Z,2,Unfortunately a lot of companies are tying to to roll data science skills into data analyst roles. Data Scientist hype is dying down as many companies do not have the infrastructure or use cases to support ML it so they end up doing mostly analyst work. Companies that actually know what they are doing call the role ML engineer.,True

@cjn211,2023-09-19T21:29:42Z,0,"Hey Alex, I‚Äôm in the process of changing careers to be a data analyst. I‚Äôm currently taking Google‚Äôs Data analytics professional certificate course on coursera. I‚Äôm on module 7 of 8 and to be honest , feeling a bit overwhelmed, in that I don‚Äôt feel like I remember 1/2 the stuff I‚Äôve already completed. The course structure of watching a 5 min video, take a quiz with a few questions and then have to go do it is hard for me. I‚Äôm the type that if I sat with you or another professional for a month and practicing, I‚Äôd be 10xs better than I am since starting this course on cousera. There‚Äôs not much repetition on there and that‚Äôs how I learn best- hands on and repetition .  Was never a computer person, but I‚Äôm very analytical. Started on wall sr couple years after HS- No college degree- I know I can do this and I know once I know what I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôll crush it. Any feedback , advice, recommendations are greatly appreciated. Are there any sort of programs or courses for excel/sheets, SQL, tableau, R , python that are interactive where they give immediate feedback and also where I can get lots of reps? Again, thanks",True
@Dwade30Beasley,2023-09-19T21:11:02Z,0,"Hi Alex, I am an architect and I am currently working as a construction site supervisor. I have been learning data analysis for a while and I am more enthusiastic and enjoy what I am doing now. When I watched this video, you wrote who can do this job in the training section. When I come home from work for about 6 months, I have been working on this job for 1-2 hours. But looking at the qualifications I see in the education section, I'm a little scared, frankly. When I get to the level where I can get a job, would it be a problem for me to study architecture to be hired? I would be glad if friends who are interested in this business can answer when they see my article.  Thanks for everything in advance.",True
