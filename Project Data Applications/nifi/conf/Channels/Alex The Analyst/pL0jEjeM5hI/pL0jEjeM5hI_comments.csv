@karenpsal,2021-11-30T16:32:55Z,0,"Hi Alex,  I‚Äôm interviewing for a Data Analyst position and they want me to complete an exercise where I need to analyze a large dataset in Excel (42 columns, 10 millions rows) using Python or SQL.  Then I have to present it. Do you have any suggestions/tips on the best way to do this?    Thanks for any feedback you can provide!",True
@gabrielfianko8964,2021-11-12T11:52:11Z,0,"Hi Alex, how are you doing? I have a question to ask. I have been googling it for a while now and the answers I find, is either too old to be applied to 2021 or not well defined.  The question is; is Chrome Os good for data analysis? There are a bunch of reasons why I prefer to buy a Chromebook to start my data analysis self teaching journey. 1. I am extremely broke and Chromebooks are a bit cheaper. 2. I kinda like the Linux way of doing things than the Windows' 3. I like the ecosystem between Android and Chrome Os I don't know (to what extent) how the slight differences between Excel and Sheets might affect me. I would like to work with Sheets than with Excel. Please let me know (at your leisure time) how safe or unsafe it is, buying and doing data science with a Chromebook.  I have another question in the pipeline, but I feel like, adding it to this one makes things lengthy. So I'll come up with that next time. Thanks.  And lo, if you have a video or any document somewhere,  answering my question, please link me. I think that will be much simpler for you",True
@COMMANDERFOX31,2021-11-08T04:06:05Z,1,"Hi Alex, a lot of big, competitive, and low tech market cities in Europe, Australia, and Canada have incredibly low success rates and awful application-to-interview ratios for data jobs. Some cities are so competitive, they set the entry-level minimum requirements to a masters degree, and even then, too many masters holders in low-tech-job cities like Toronto are sitting unemployed and switching to similar dev/IT roles just to make a living. What do you recommend in those scenarios? Is it worth moving to the US?",True
@DownToEarthMind,2021-11-07T23:39:32Z,0,"Alteryx is an amazing tool and replaces the need to learn SQL, Python or Data Science related coding. The only problem is, you need a company that can afford the license fees to get you a seat",True
@BummerSlug,2021-11-07T18:43:12Z,0,"I love the content. I have to disagree with the education. I have 15+ years analytics experience in the military, built a portfolio but keep getting passed over for fresh college grads. 65+ job applications fromAug 8 through today.  one job went to a 23 year old who didn‚Äôt event know pivot tables in excel.  From my view, to make it as self taught it is all about being at the right place at the right time. Good luck with that. For every Alex (who I do appreciate, nothing but appreciation from me) there are 2000 others that are not given that chance. Go get the education, certification and anything else to help you stand out. Keep trying, don‚Äôt quit - but stay realistic and get certifications.",True
@myownflow9887,2021-11-06T13:18:34Z,0,I wonder how long it takes to get a job after taking a data analysist course at a bootscamp like Faltiron on average.,True

@adamwhite6797,2021-11-01T23:51:28Z,0,As a Marine vet who is coming from Aviation data admin and worked as an Army contractor to now working towards my data analysis degree this is helpful.

@kaaba92,2021-10-31T03:02:06Z,1,"Hi Alex I just gotta say, this is a awesome video. Thank you. I say this because it gives me a sense of hope and inspiration that I too can become a data analyst. I'm currently in an online school right now taking a course in data analytics. I'm also  taking a course in SQL . I'm learning SQL on Microsoft SQL Server. I'm currently 5 months in on the data analytics course. I'm 2 months in learning SQL at another online school. I'm coming from working 30+ years in the United States Postal Service üì´ . I wanted to start a new career that involves me solving problems and no more heavy lifting Amazon packages üòÑ  Keep up the good work you're doing.  Peace",True
@salarshahabadi1353,2021-10-30T16:09:35Z,0,Hey! I have been following you for a bit and I wanted your advice because I was actually interested in BI analytics but I am not sure which master or certification online I should apply to.

@tharrimo4able,2021-10-29T14:34:26Z,1,Thanks alex. Been loving your content as a whole. Very inspiring and very helpful at squashing imposter syndrome when it inevitably creeps up on a self taught analyst. I haven't been actively practicing my data tools and certainly needed this one. Thanks again =D,True

You make high quality videos, high quality in production but also content. You've drastically changed the way I think about data and the IT field whether through the topics you discuss, the tutorials that you teach, the references that you share, and so much more. I appreciate all the work and dedication you've done for us since the very beginning. I hope to give back in return by watching all of your videos and someday buying your merch. Sincerely, from an aspiring 18-year old data analyst.",True

Will definitely watch this tonight/tomorrow as I prep for interview #2!  Thank you for all your content, it has helped me tremendously as I transition into data analytics! Do you have any advice for those of us who are getting interviews, but haven‚Äôt yet gotten an offer? I‚Äôm still applying and studying, putting myself out there, but want to improve and get hired already. Is it just a patience game and keep staying as positive as possible?",True
@timvibes,2021-10-26T20:33:16Z,1,Love that you all did not study data analytics in college because I for sure would not want to rack up more debt by going back for a second degree in data analytics. I truly now believe it is about finding your resources and grinding. Thank you!,True

@joshi1q2w3e,2021-10-26T14:25:52Z,7,"While Domain Knowledge is very important it is something that can be learned, quicker & easier than the technical skills.   So, if you‚Äôre hiring someone who has most of the technical skills but not the domain knowledge don‚Äôt count them out. Just cause someone has domain knowledge doesn‚Äôt always mean they‚Äôll be the better analyst.   At least that‚Äôs been my experience in Analytics. It might be easier for Analytics managers to think that way because it‚Äôs more convenient/self-serving for them but doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right.   As a matter of fact, when you see an Analyst who‚Äôs worked in multiple industries and done well then you know they must be good at learning.",True
@danramirz,2021-10-26T10:54:07Z,52,I appreciate that last question. I‚Äôm 44. I  explained to my wife that I can make a career change at my age. Currently learning python üêçfor data analytics on udemy and working on projects.  Thanks for the encouraging video.,True
