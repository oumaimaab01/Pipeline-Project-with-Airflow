@lindaluke3704,2023-03-22T02:12:46Z,3,"Thank you for taking the time to give advice! The offer I was given by one bootcamp for UI/UX was $15,000, with a 3 month, full time track and job guarantee. I will research my way through Udemy, Khan, LinkedIn, and others.",True
@madimccormick97,2023-03-06T17:40:15Z,0,"2 years later, do you still feel this way? There are a lot more options available now. I’ve seen offerings from over 20 companies; Thinkful, General Assemb.ly, Codecademy, etc. plus ones from companies like EdX that partner with universities. I’d love an update with your thoughts. As someone who’s trying to break into this profession in 2023 with no coding background, but a BSBA double major in economics and finance, the number of Bootcamp and online certificate options is a bit overwhelming. Thanks in advance if you update, and thanks anyway if not! Love the channel.",True
@cassial89,2022-12-21T21:20:49Z,0,"I'm contemplating doing a bootcamp, but I have no other 'real' tech experience.  I'm really wondering if a DA bootcamp + my liberal arts bachelor's degree will cut it.",True
@kmart014,2022-08-23T05:12:31Z,0,I don’t have a bachelors degree. I never finished school. I have some university coursework. I have a customer service background . I currently have a county job. I want to make a career change but I’m so confused on how. You said if you don’t have a bachelors degree and just a boot camp certificate you’re likely not to get the job. Should I go back and get my degree? It was in Sociology. Not really field related either. So idk what to do,True
@sarah-annekays3916,2022-07-22T02:23:45Z,1,"Have you ever heard of Merit America? I would love a video on that as I'm applying and I've only seen positives associated with it. You pay $0 up front and don't pay anything until you get a job making $40k or more a year. Plus, they work with your schedule so you don't have to quit your job. You put in about 20-25 hours per week for 16 weeks. The price is $5,400 no interest, and you pay $95 a month after you get a job. I want to know your opinions on this as I've watched your videos for a while and would love feedback!",True
@Gevorian,2022-06-23T19:41:20Z,0,"I recently withdrew from a software engineering degree due to financial reasons but I can afford to take on a data analysis bootcamp while I'm out of school, do you think that will be enough for me to land a job? I have coding experience dating back to high school but not much job experience. I spent most of my years in college/high school doing freelance IT technical support on fiverr doing computer optimizations, desktop/laptop/phone repairs, and creating software programs for friends when I have the time.",True
@MrJsz90,2022-05-22T18:59:48Z,0,"So I got a masters in computer and information systems. My bachelors is in psychology. I did a career change and went into IT. My problem has been that the program undid my masters in was new so not as structured as it probably is now. Because of that I did not get any real experience and could not land any real entry level job because I am ""over qualified"". And since of that reason I have no real job experience because no one was really giving me a chance. Now I'm looking to get back into the workforce after being a stay at home dad but I think in order for me to do that, these bootcamps might be the quickest way. Not concerned about cost. Friend I know who have done these bootcamps have been successful and found a job quickly.",True

@jaberabedin5487,2022-02-26T22:04:17Z,1,"Alex - super quick question: if money was NOT an issue AT ALL, would you recommend any of these bootcamps? if yes, which one(s)? PS I feel like my answer would've been no, given the plethora of astronomically cheaper/free courses out there + the dedication to truly learning all of the skills and technologies in depth can only be done by myself at my own pace and which schools and bootcamps aren't really conducive for",True
@SoundofSilence1,2022-02-16T16:37:14Z,0,What about bootcamps that requires you to pay only after getting placed,True
@manishthapa2389,2022-02-10T08:01:53Z,0,Hi Alex I have recently subscribed to your channel as I plan to become a Data analyst. I would appreciate your input on the below. I currently hold a Masters's Degree in Supply chain management but have not worked in this space. I have worked in the Project management and Operations management space with shipping companies. Recently I moved to Canada and am looking for courses through which I can enhance my knowledge in Data Analytics. I finally narrowed down my search to the University of Toronto Data Analytics boot camp and Mc Gill University's Professional Development Certificate in Data Analytics for Business or  Professional DevelopmentCertificate In Data Science and Machine Learning. I am 40 and need a University name also to back my credentials. Hoping to get some clarity from you,True

@JSmoove90,2020-11-28T02:08:18Z,3,"I have taken one, I highly recommend just going to Web dev bootcamp first and learning the data analyst stuff in your free time...One for the simple reason you can get a data analyst job just knowing sql and how to do charts....I took the data scientist route and when I interview with employers they are basically looking for software engineers then being able to apply data techniques maybe for visualization...Just my opinion",True
@Carageous,2020-11-20T22:09:42Z,5,"Alex, what would you suggest as an alternative? If I’m self taught or boot camp certified, that still leaves me with not meeting the minimum qualifications of a bachelors degree.

Of course it's not purely binary, because some people know more about SQL, Python, or just have better insights in general than others, but what counts is passing the code interview (and the other interviews).
