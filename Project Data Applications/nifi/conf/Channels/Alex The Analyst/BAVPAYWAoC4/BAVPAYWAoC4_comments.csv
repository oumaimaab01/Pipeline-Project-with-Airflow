@moonyaco,2023-02-03T10:20:49Z,0,"Thank you for this video. Before watching this, I had a call asking me about my understanding of the data analyst and data engineer role. I knew nothing about the data engineer role and the hiring company was mostly concerned about how good I am at SQL and Python. Since I was still trying to get my feet wet through an entry level data analyst job, I am still learning Python through online videos. I was surprised that they only had a data engineer position available and did not mind that I had a commerce degree instead of the a data/statistics/math related one.  After watching this video, I'm pretty sure, as someone who has only gone through courses related to data analysis, data engineers are definitely require a whole lot more training before they can get hired relative to a data analyst.",True
