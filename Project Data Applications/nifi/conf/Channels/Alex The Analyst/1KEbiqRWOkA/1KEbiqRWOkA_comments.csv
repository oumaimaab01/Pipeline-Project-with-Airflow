@dawewatwese6301,2024-03-05T19:53:41Z,0,"Hi Everyone, I kinda followed all of these for the past 4 months and I still haven't gotten any interviews. I have emailed many recruiters on Linkedin but they don't even send a reply. I also have a portfolio but I noticed on GitHub there is no traffic, meaning the recruiters are not even checking my portfolio. The saddest part i got laid off from my current job, but even with a computer science degree and BootCamp certificates, i still got no offers, this whole thing is starting to get depressing",True

@pluderr3947,2024-03-05T15:57:31Z,54,"I followed all of Alex's tips and got my first data job 4 months ago, fully remote paying $25 an hour.  Not much but I'm proud! I don't have a college degree at all, just hard work and proving to people that I can do the work. What really set me apart was my python skills, my employer knew this was a valuable skill and with this I was able to automate an entire week's worth of data entry in just 3 hours with Selenium.   Alex is totally right when he says that projects and working with a recruiter is what will help you land that first data job. If it weren't for me creating projects and showcasing them during my interview and not working with a recruiter I would not have obtained this job.   Those who are working towards a data job, don't give up and continuously improve your skills especially SQL and Python. Thanks Alex!",True

Your future employer's internal recruiters couldn't fill your future position and now they have to pay someone to find you. Just follow the money and you will see.
