@mvgustafson,2023-08-12T16:49:46Z,0,"Thanks for sharing your insights. I'm in my early 50s, and 3 years ago stumbled into a Business Intelligence Developer position. I love it; wish I'd known the world of data analytics existed decades ago. Now, I'm faced with the reality that my career has never been linear.  It's taken many twists and turns with different skillsets, including primarily focused on raising kids for 15 years.    In my current position, I am  the most knowledgeable in the company and100% self taught by reading books, online courses, etc. This is meant to boast, it's actually a somewhat sad reality. It's frustrating not having anyone to talk to with more advanced skills than myself to know if I'm approaching projects the ""right"" way.   I look at postings for other jobs specific to my skillset (Power BI) and based on my actual experience with the tool, I can't even find anything that isn't entry level that's paying anywhere near what I'm currently making.  I've been sitting on the fence on whether or not to pursue a master's and frankly, this video helped cement the fact I really don't have a choice if I want to advance my career.  I can't get in 10 years of experience with the expectation I having an additional 20 years to work.",True

I changed majors several times before I stuck with computer science and took several semesters off in the process. I was interested in being a mobile app developer, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that I loved the idea. I took a course in SQL and had already been using Python for a while and I fell in love with it. I got a job as a merchandise coordinator for a small company, but this company also has me handle data projects. Going to stores, talking with people, looking at sales and transactional data, trying to figure out ways to increase sales or make some processes more efficient.  I decided to stop going to school, though, because it was going to cost me an additional $20,000 to finish since it‚Äôs a private school (the only school I could go to fully online, or at least the only one I knew of). I also have a family and don‚Äôt have much free time. I felt, since none of the classes I had left had much to do with data analysis, that my time would be better spent working my current job‚Äôs projects (all done in Excel) and my own projects using that data and other data, but using SQL, Python, and visualization software as well. I felt like I could learn so much more without wasting two years learning things that weren‚Äôt valuable to the career I actually wanted.  I‚Äôm sorry this was really long, but I guess my question is if you think this is a wise decision to make?

@physicsteachr,2022-08-01T08:09:23Z,0,I did all three and it cost a lot of avocados...üòÖ.  Took grad-level courses in math and played around with computer models in college.  Did a solid two years of self-teaching (which doesn't count 13 years of just coding for fun) before starting the bootcamp.  The bootcamp was definitely the most fun of the three but then I was basically paid to do it (Covid-enhanced UI) and it had a solid job guarantee. It worked out great for me but I raise an eyebrow even more at claims of rags-to-riches in under a year.  My program did streamline the networking and job search process and ultimately placed me with my current employer.,True

For me, it was actually a pretty natural career change as I was doing a ton of data analyst type work in my job as a biologist. I kept getting more and more into it and better and better at it and realized I a) should be getting paid more, and b) absolutely love this kind of work, so I enrolled in a MS Statistics program and am learning a lot of coding etc on my own. All the coding stuff is actually pretty easy to learn on your own. Self-learning graduate level math and statistics is going to be nearly impossible for most people and is a big part of what separates data analysts from data scientists from what I understand. Some of it is very, very challenging. Learning Excel and SQL is a cinch by comparison and just requires time investment.",True

@brookewhatnall,2022-03-14T01:39:08Z,2,"Hi Alex,  First of all thank you for you're very clear high quality videos, finding your content amazing and very helpful.  I'm 30 with no degree. Went from high school to completing a cadetship in photojournalism. After this I made a move into the tourism industry, in particular adventure tourism and paragliding. From 2013 right up until COVID I was instructing paragliding, flying tandems and working as an operations manager for a tandem company in New Zealand. The roles in this job were broad, and covered some basic web development and marketing, and allowed me to apply my photography experience in a marketing capacity. Long story short, COVID hit, wiped out the tourism industry in NZ and I made a move back into photography full time and have been shooting real estate up until preset.   I've been considering changing careers, as my heart isn't in real estate, and have always had an interest in IT as a hobby (basic web dev/swift & iOs/some python). Recently discovered the field of data analytics and it was like a lightbulb moment. The mix of analytical and creative problem solving aligns so well with my way of thinking, and for most of my life I've been slightly obsessed with using and leveraging spreadsheets to collect data and find ways to improve various parts of my work and personal life. I was writing spreadsheets find ways to improve the operation of the tandem paragliding business pre-COVID and never knew this falls under the field of data analytics.  I'm working my way through the Google Data Analytics course on coursera, as well as the datacamp modules (SQL is so much fun!), and know this is the right career for me, however I'm having trouble deciding whether to commit to a bootcamp later this year. I'm looking into Ironhack in Berlin, as I will be there through the summer, and more importantly they offer a job guarantee type funding (no payment until you earn over a certain amount in the field). Considering that there will be no upfront cost, and being realistic that it's a fantastic fast track for skills, but knowing it won't get me 100% job ready, what are your thoughts on going down this path? Will combine it with self learning up to the course date, and focus on personal projects afterwards until I manage to land my first job. Would a bootcamp be sensible in this scenario? I feel that I'm a little too far in my life to start a 4-5 year degree.",True

@desireelauterbach5444,2022-02-17T09:23:08Z,0,"I spent $ on a 10 week bootcamp.  I spent 3 weeks there from 7:30am (everyone was asked to) and we stayed until 8-9pm daily!  They had too many students and not enough instructors (we started with 2 instructors and an assistant instructor that was a recent bootcamp graduate), and at the 2.5 week mark we had only 1 instructor and they quit mid week with zero notice!  They had the assistant as replacement for a few days but too many students (all chairs filled and lounge area) so they asked some students to quit for a refund or they threatened to cancel the whole class right then and send everyone home!  No one volunteered.  I was one of several asked to go even though I had been doing well.  In fact, on my time off myself and 3 others won an award at LinkedIn's HackHer event that year!  I was partially refunded but I lost lots of money due to being from out of area and having prepaid for living space, and other arrangements I had made to be there for its entirety, not to mention the hardship it caused back home because I had to change those commitments when I went in good faith.  Save your money on bootcamps as my story is not uncommon.  Also, even thought they say their prep materials will mean it is okay for anyone to learn coding before attending a bootcamp, you should know html5, css3, Javascript, SQL, GitHub, and React is recommended.  They are used at all the major bootcamps even if they concentrate later on other languages.  Learn online by doing, not just watching videos,  and join programming communities.",True

@3690markm,2022-02-09T15:13:15Z,0,"Hi Alex.  Marshall here.  I appreciate your honest opinion on things even if it takes admitting a little emotion around why you feel strongly for/against something.  I've recently decided to change my career (or get on one altogether).  It's something I've been struggling with since graduating college back in 2008, just after the recession.  Since then, I have been traveling for the past 14 years working odd jobs and mainly focused on my bucket list, climbing rocks, camping under desert stars, solving climate change crisis through biking and organic farming (we see how impactful that was, some would call it a gravity problem I guess because it can't get fixed.  I see that now).  I finished with my B.S. in Mathematics back in 2008 like I said and now, I'm finally getting back on track with plan A, which is what I arguably should have done from the start.  However, I don't regret a single thing and have experienced an unbelievable amount for my age which is why it's quite a philosophical conundrum.  I've moved past that now.  Furthermore, (fast-forward to today) after looking all over for some way to use my bachelor's degree and establish a new career, I've felt a strong pull toward Data Analytics/Science.  I'm 36 years old now and 14 years out of college and, however, have 5 years of Management experience in the Retail environment.  I do realize the mountain that lies ahead of me and have realistic expectations about obstacles and hurdles that are sure to come, albeit still a bit blissfully ignorant of the details. In addition to my love for mathematics, I speak French as well.  None of this is related to tech.  But I'm all in on this and have decided that a bootcamp is the best thing for me to get back on track quicker and with structure, pace, and guidance.  For people like me, it simply seems to be the best option.  It's crunch time. I don't have any spare time to throw away (much like the money you didn't have at the start). I've still got car payments/insurance payments, buying a new computer, etc that I must keep paying for so 2 years simply is too much time to spend on a degree.  It's not like I have extra money just lying around though.  I've busted my butt the past 5 years making a less than desirable wage in a very high cost of living environment (Front Range CO) which is totally not sustainable and still somehow managed to save just enough to get me through the next 10-12 months without a job.  No luck was involved there in any way.  Just old fashioned drive, focus, and determination.  Like I said, I'm all in on this thing.  I'm going with a combination of General Assembly and University of Denver.  It will definitely be a chunk of change but I'm 100% all in and banking on a ROI.  Furthermore, I do agree that a M.S. in DS is more intriguing, shiny, and desirable and will be seeking that down the road after landing a first job.  Right now, it just simply isn't an option like I've already stated.  So, maybe this helps shed some light why someone would want to be as efficient as possible with their time and take a risk with their Savings and go for it with a Bootcamp.  All in all, I feel like Indiana Jones sprinting toward the closing tomb door and can hopefully slide under and escape the collapsing structure.  So, Thank you again for all this very enlightening content you're posting about Data Industry career paths and providing tons of very valuable insight on how to make a successful transition.  I just stumbled upon your account last night as I was working through some Excel spreadsheets and look forward to watching them throughout my journey to tech.  Sincerely, Thank you.  Right now, somebody like me needs a kind person such as yourself being real, laying out genuine knowledge of the path one must follow and skills one must acquire all the while staying positive and uplifting.  If it's one thing I've learned traveling the world on my own, is stoke must remain high, especially when taking on the impossible. Cheers my friend.  Best of luck to you in your ventures.",True

Since I self-studied for pharmacy, I‚Äôm fairly certain I can self-study for data analyst.

If I had money, I would support your page (maybe one day in the future when I am a data analyst!)  I am struggling with deciding what to do with my life. To be honest, I am totally lost. I've got a BSc in Economics, and I do enjoy the subject area but it is tough to get a job directly related to it. I just graduated last year, but I have some work experience (internships) - Under Revenue Management for an airline (looking at data and forecasting some trends), at a Bank (operations - mainly coding and excel work which I did not enjoy) and now I am working at a think thank doing economics and policy research.  I just do not see the value in pursuing economics further for a master's degree. I have an interest in Finance and Data analytics. I got into a few unis - for different courses and I've narrowed it down to 3:  1. Economics & Finance 2. Business Analytics 3. Applied Data science and statistics (with a professional placement year)  I just do not know what to do, or what I will enjoy. Without a CS background, I do not feel comfortable with coding, and my current skills are in STATA & Excel. I do not find it extremely difficult to learn to code but I know it will be very challenging plus I am not sure if that's what I want to be doing with my life - coding on a daily basis. I do enjoy looking at data to drive insights though, but I do not enjoy the coding aspect as it seems daunting. Also, I feel like it does not involve economics at all, where else with a finance degree there is some overlap and I do have an interest there. The job prospects are one that drives me away from finance - I do not want to be working late nights every day of the week (this is not me).  I am leaning towards accepting the program in applied data science w/placement because I think a placement would give invaluable experience for someone entering that field. Furthermore, I think the skills I will learn during the course could be highly transferable to another industry - say I didn't enjoy the industry after giving it 5 or so years, I would like the option to go back to economics.

The classic even entry level jobs require a masters degree and 2-5 years of excperience in that specific thing holds very true.

@Shadowoftheoldones,2021-02-06T05:45:08Z,8,"Self-learning is great, but if you can afford a bootcamp, I don't really see a downside over teaching yourself. Having a guide helps you identify what you need to learn, and gives you a pace (and you also have people to talk to when you get stuck). Yeah, you won't be totally job ready after 6 months in one, but you'll be in a better position to teach yourself. I'm halfway through mine, and I'm way more confident with python; at the beginning I didn't really know enough to start teaching it to myself. On the other side, I will say that some bootcamps are way too much money. You aren't getting a full degree, and you shouldn't have to pay for one.  Also: Avocado!",True

I've come to realize, I think, that my current job is just too stressful and I think data analytics would be right up my alley. I'm not looking for no stress at all, just less stress than I currently have.  I would love to hear more about how long different types of projects can take and some examples (with company names redacted) of actual projects you've worked on.

@midlander8186,2020-09-25T23:23:26Z,0,"I don't know at what age you began your pursuit of knowledge of and a career in data analysis, but you're certainly younger than I am.  I don't think you have a proper appreciation of the time spent pursuing knowledge.  In this video you mention the time spent pursuing a knowledge of data analysis, no question about it, but clearly the financial cost of your pursuit was more important to you than the time you spent in this pursuit.  For me time is paramount.  You mentioned avocados and dedication.  My dedication is to assessing whether a pursuit of knowledge of data analysis is worth my time and the opportunity cost of time spent in such a pursuit.  I think I might be well suited to data analysis because of my education in math, but I don't know whether I'd like a career in data analysis, and frankly this video has dissuaded me from pursuing such a career.

@donnelly5757,2020-09-25T07:28:30Z,4,"Hey Alex, interesting insight on the degree approach! Very useful content as usual!   I have been self-teaching myself for over a year now using Python, SQL, and now Tableau, and I have enjoyed every minute of it! I am 45 yeas of age. My job history prior to joining the Navy at age 33 was working low-wage, low skill jobs except for having run a small income tax service business preparing basic and more simple business tax returns for clients for a few years prior to joining the military. I served four years in the Navy as Hospital 'Corpsman working in a General Surgery clinic. When I got out, I pursued both an undergraduate and master's in exercise science. I graduated back in 2017. Since, then I have only been able to find low-wage, low skill jobs (helper clerk at a grocery store, physical therapy aid, ticket-scanner at  ski area, Target cashier, etc). Basically, other than my career in the Navy and owning a small income tax return business,  I have no civilian career established. I have no money, and am $100k in student loan debt making $17.5k a year.  I do not want to work in a clinical setting where I am working directly with patients.  What would you suggest I do to increase my marketability in hopes of getting a data analyst job? I have no wife or kids, no house, so I am not tied down to any of those obligations. Should I consider going into more student loan debt to pursue a master's in computer science or statistics? What other options are there?",True

I wisely choose self-learning especially as a alumni because it is thousand times more affordable. For the past several weeks, I'm watching so many youtube videos related to my desired positions as a Data/Business Analyst.  I also purchase some coursera courses through promotion.
