@00pepexxx,2024-02-10T21:27:49Z,1,But what if you can already use python or Rstudio to go through data? Will the companies have anything against it?,True
@marmalar,2024-02-08T20:46:20Z,2,"This is so true! I literally just started working as a Data Analyst and the public school I work for has just SQL and MS Report Builder... not the snappiest of response times for queries and report-building compared to my previous Corpo-rat job as a Front-End Dev, but I am happy to flex my brain in a crunchier way that I am enjoying so much better! Hopefully, next role will be at a fancier company with shiny new tools... but this is awesome for starting my Tech Career pivot during a rough economy!",True
@fiattenebris,2024-01-31T11:35:25Z,1,"Agree! If you are a data analyst, you might tap into the data source yourself using SQL, or someone else will make a .csv avaliable for you. Even if you use Python for data cleansing, ultimately your internal client will use Excel so you need to know it well enough to present the results in a way they will understand and be able to perform ad hoc analysis on the fly.",True

@ryanhendrakurniawan,2023-10-10T04:02:38Z,6,"Meanwhile if you look at junior data analyst vacancy in Indonesia, you'll find out that almost all of them require Python, which is ridiculous",True
@jphd21,2023-10-09T23:41:03Z,20,"Thank you for saying this!! There is a misconception out there that the more tools you know, the better analyst you are!! Which is not true at all!!",True
@TaherKoronful,2023-10-09T18:41:40Z,1,What if i am using Bigquery and google sheets ?,True
