Is there a reason that you wouldn't create the schema for the table and create an auto incrementing id column that is the primary key to assign a unique id to every row, then use the row_number function to search for duplicate rows using all the columns except the id column. This would save you from having to create a duplicate table to store row_num as you could just use the id column to delete the duplicate records. This also seems like it would make your database easier to deal with since it would have a proper primary key. Sure, it is a meaningless primary key, but it would certainly make updating the data easier and faster in many cases.",True

@SomeStatus,2024-04-26T20:14:10Z,1,"Just wanted to leave a comment for anyone who has converted from a .csv to a json and having issue with NULL parts of the video.  Per ChatGPT: When you converted your file from CSV to JSON, it's possible that any empty values in the CSV file were transformed into the string ""NULL"" in the JSON file, rather than being stored as actual NULL values in the database. That's why querying for NULL values using IS NULL doesn't return any results because the values are actually stored as the string ""NULL"".  To address this issue, you'll need to modify your query to account for the string ""NULL"" instead of actual NULL values. You can do this by adjusting your WHERE clause to check for both actual NULL values and the string ""NULL"".  Here's how you can modify your query:  sql Copy code SELECT * FROM layoffs_staging2 WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL OR total_laid_off = 'NULL'; This query will return rows where the total_laid_off column has either actual NULL values or the string ""NULL"". This should retrieve the rows you're expecting.",True

But from the first encounter of your content, I knew I'm gonna walk on your foot steps. I loved it and also I was looking for some data like this last 2 weeks, I did tried on most the US, Indian data bureau(s) and where not. Yesterday I decided to make this project at hand, AND WOW It was that data I was looking for. Thank you so much. This is my second project ever in SQL. I love it totally from the beginning to the end. And I had so much fun doing this project, literally. I was laughing with the funny parts, even overwhelmed in the end at that industry populating part juts like. I cheered yayy. I made a mistake too, I forgot to run the deleting query of the duplicates. I had to run from the start to find out where did I miss. I love your energy and how to take things so calmly and carry the learner with you till the very motive. I probably have written too much now. I am so excited to follow this project till the visualization part. And here's one more thing I tried, I wanna show you - In the populating part, we can do it without making the blanks, null. This is the query I tried,  UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1 JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2 ON (t1.company = t2.company AND t1.location = t2.location) SET t1.industry = t2.industry WHERE  (t1.industry IS NULL OR t1.industry = '') AND (t2.industry IS NOT NULL AND t2.industry != '');",True
