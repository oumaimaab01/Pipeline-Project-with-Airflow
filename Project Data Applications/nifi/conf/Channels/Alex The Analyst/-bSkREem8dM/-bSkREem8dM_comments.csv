@bobsutube,2023-10-09T16:00:25Z,1,"As a designer of many OLTP databases - I don't understand how an OLTP is considered ""flexible"" while an OLAP is considered ""rigid"".  Both have the same considerations - usually you can add a column whereever you want, just don't change or remove a column.  Changing or removing a column in an OLTP database will break the application residing on top if it.  And some application layers will even throw an error when you add a column, even a nullable one, to an OLTP table.  There is nothing flexible about an OLTP database as far as I can tell - and it is less flexible than OLAP imo.  I'm open to hearing arguments the other way - I'm just not understanding",True

@LarsPW,2023-03-12T18:41:59Z,0,"I think that a database is rather a basic element of both operational or data warehous databases. Operational databases are used by multi-user applications as human ressources, payments, bookkeeping, logistics etc. They are mostly of the relational type. In a conventional environment a data warehouse consists as well of one or more relational databases loaded by ETL-jobs extracting, transforming and loading data from the operational databases into the data warehouse on a regular basis, at least once a day. While operational databases just contain the data needed for daily business the data warehouse builds the long term data memory of the entire company. The data in the data warehouse must be made accessible by business intelligence software to produce short and long term statistics and reports supporting the control of business.  Having the IT organised in the way descibed above the operational database(s) with their OLTP can be kept relatively small and technical processes of any kind run more quickly. Many reporting abilities of business applications can be stripped off because most reporting could be done by the business intelligence software relying on the data in the data warehouse. In other words: The evaluation of business processes does not need to rely on reporting functionalities of business applications and data mining could bring data of different sources together independent of the source having them created.  A data lake is an unstructured collection of data in its original form. It could be seen as the opposite of a data warehouse, but most companies have some data of which an ETL-process is not viable, e.g. correspondence and lots of descriptional documents.",True

Database is just a collection of data, similarly a data warehouse is also a collection of data. A database can be a data warehouse, but it can also contain operational data, which usually differs from a data warehouse. Also a data warehouse is not only OLAP, as OLAP is a technology that can be implemented on top of a data warehouse or completely separate from a data warehouse.

One of the more common generic alternatives are hierarchical databases. Some simple examples of that are xml with xquery or the windows registry. I have even used what was tab delineated files and a file system hierarchy to do bioinformatics research. A second thing is that databases don't need to be persistent, ACID, or on disk. The point being keep your mind open to things past RDBs. A different data store and query system may provide a better solution to the problem at hand. If you do use RDBs, please bring it to third normal form, preferably BCNF.

@Knight3rrant,2022-05-15T19:47:14Z,0,"I disagree with your descriptions in some ways. Especially the bullet point and mention of the data warehouse's data being summarized. You seemed to say, without saying the actual word, that the database data was being aggregated when the ETL process brought the data into the data warehouse. Ok. That is fine and in my experience happens that way quite often by default. The issue I have with that is you also describe the Data Warehouse as where the the analysis and reporting of the data occurs. The sort of 'analysis' you can perform with aggregated data is severely limited. As in 'kindergarden through grade school' limited. Any sort of analysis with aggregated data will be comparing volumes of X and volumes of Y against dates when known incidents occurred or certain conditions obtained (i.e. an outage, inventory shortfall, holiday weekend, etc) at most. And that is pretty much the limit of what can be done when performing an analysis with aggregated data. I - myself - as a systems data analyst and data architect, have come to regard these terms as having become 'executive-speak' as of 2022 and are not very useful in describing the concepts required for conceptualizing modern data storage, processing, and analytics - especially in light of the revolution slowly unfolding with the emergence and evolution of cloud (distributed) technologies.

@DanDirindon,2022-05-11T20:09:19Z,0,"Sorry but you have described a Data Lake in a too generic way. It sounds only like a place where you can put everything, and nothing more! So does any company that holds data own a Data Lake? I do not think so! In my humble opinion, a Data Like is more an idea than a well-defined concept, appreciated more by the technology vendors to sell huge systems. The term was coined by the Chief Technology Officer of Pentaho, James Dixon, but then it evolved depending on the interests of users, vendors and academic gurus. A serious Data Lake should have the technology, tools, space, resources to load and manage any kind of data mainly from the scratch, with no predetermined or predefined structure or schema. Including real-time data, raw, not cleaned data, or unstructured data, videos, voice, text or clickstream! Independently from the true presence of all these kinds of data in the company and from the real usage of this data. It is strategic to maintain a central repository with metatags and the references to all the data stored in the Data Lake to avoid losing large amount of time to look for something. The same for a system of Data Security to prevent unauthorized accesses to each portion of data. And a lot of effort to avoid that the Data Lake evolves in a Data Swamp! To be more precise, a Data Lake is useful but not strictly necessary for machine learning or artificial intelligence like many people say. And finally, let me state that at least 99% of the companies in the world do not need a real Data Lake, no matter what the technology vendors suggest.",True

@FrostSpike,2022-05-11T15:00:34Z,7,"Data in the core of the warehouse is normally full-grain (albeit not necessarily all the tables/columns - it's a subset not a summary). It's highly normalised to keep the size down as much as possible. Overlaying the data warehouse are the data marts which are structured (with summaries) for easy analytical consumption. Some people conflate the two and see the data marts (sometimes called information marts) as being part of the data warehouse (and, depending on the platform, might just be views over the curated store) but they're logically a separate layer performing a different function. The Data Lake fulfils the same function as the Data Warehouse core but is more flexible on the types of content it can capture. There's a new-ish architecture called a ""Data Lakehouse"" which sort of composites the two concepts.",True

Analytics on a data warehouse is typically done by a data analyst with traditional data analyst skillsets (SQL, R etc). Analytics on a data lake is typically done by a data scientist (Python, ML etc)  An important point to note is ""if you have all this data and you have no idea what to do with it"" for data lake, a vital thing to focus on when creating a data lake is the structure of your data in the lake (as in directory and file structure) if you just dump it all in, it will become a data swamp and waste of money",True
