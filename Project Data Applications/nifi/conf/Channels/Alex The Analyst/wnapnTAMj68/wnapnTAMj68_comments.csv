@KenSherman,2022-07-07T17:00:59Z,2,"To enrollees & potential enrollees: I stress having a sense of healthy urgency to complete this program. It is not a course, per say. Courses are individual modules adding up to a full specialization, program, or professional certificate; it is a number of courses rolled into a program where one should pace themselves to actually LEARN the materials & not speed rush through it just to obtain a certificate.   However, you can still review the materials after you've finished if you rushed through it. I don't recommend this method because most ppl don't typically commit themselves 2 do that. And don't cheat. You only short or limit yourself if you don't properly leverage the program's skills & training the right way.   Employers are generally not hiring based on your tech/hard skills alone (or at all) which can be more or less OTJ training anyway. They are hiring more so based off of your soft skills. Faking it until you're making it usually don't always apply. So build on your business acumen or portfolio after SUCCESSFULLY completing the program & let the program work FOR you not against you.

@Rhand007,2021-12-07T20:03:40Z,2,"I think your review is too positive, but then again you didn't do the course. You just read through the Syllabus and based on that it actually sounds good and promising. That's what I thought when I enrolled. Unfortunately, it's not that useful. Google made this more from a marketing perspective rather than a desire to create real Data Analysts. Majority of Tableau, Excel and SQL is theory and course progression is usually handheld (copy this, copy that, etc), exercises and exams are too few and too easy. It will ask questions like ""copy this formula into the sheet and tell us the result from options A-D"" rather than ""please tell us which formula you would use from options A-D to achieve result x"" or simply give us a target ""what's the average cost of the items available in the NY shop"" and force us to discover ourself which formulas to use (THAT would be useful learning). It focuses too much on theory and too little on hands-on exercises. It's question pool is also very limited, if you make any mistakes during a test and have to redo it, it are exactly the same questions. I'm in the last course (R) and I already know now that despite completing this course, I will have to go to YouTube/Udemy and spend hours more on actual SQL/Tableau courses and exercises. This course is only useful for those who need an introduction to Data Analytics (and should just do course 1 and 2) or for those who want the Google Certificate and can get it cheaply (sponsored or max 2 months subscription fee).",True

@theMiaow,2021-06-06T15:30:00Z,1,"So I've completed six of them and I've discovered one huge flaw regarding this certification. IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TECHNICAL EXERCISES. I am most particularly disappointed on the data visualization course, which it barely touched on Tableau and they taught more about the theory behind how to choose the right visualization and storytelling than Tableau itself. And I'm gonna be extremely honest, freecodecamp's tableau youtube video covered WAY MORE than the google's course, which is laughable in my opinion. How are the students gonna be confident with their tableau skills on the job if this is the case?! And I am paying $39 for this cert, yet a free video on youtube covered more than a paid cert, wtf?  Also, the courses that touched on SQL and R don't really prompt us students to THINK for the answers. Rather, it literally let's us copy and paste the codes for us to follow along the tutorial, which is an extremely bad teaching method in my opinion as many students will most probably find themselves to be unconfident with what they have learned in the end. Imagine learning programming just from watching lectures and no homework were given to us to further test our understanding. Yeap, this is EXACTLY how it felt like while I was doing the google's cert. Numerous times I had to rely on other people's tutorial videos, and I'm beginning to question the validity of this cert's claim that it readies us for a job in the data analyst field.",True

@rezayahyaei5357,2021-03-13T19:41:24Z,0,Hi Alex. I'm currently studying my Master's degree in Medical Informatics. I'm in a great dilemma right now whether to continue it to PhD (data analysis specific to biological data) or just learn the general data science on my own and start my career. I feel that doctoral education is a waste of time and has low potential income. Is it more difficult to start an entry-level job in data science (or analytics) in a foreign country (e.g. US) or to start a PhD? Since you're already in the industry I'd like to know your view. Thanks a lot!,True
@AmitKumar-kh2tx,2021-03-13T19:35:17Z,1,"Hi Alex.. One question  Is the certificate only for U.S citizens, and not for Indian Citizens??  Can't Indian citizens do the certification here??",True
@RicardoLelis,2021-03-13T19:25:46Z,0,I won't be reconsidering! Sorry but teaching in R was a mistake. Python gives you much more versatility since you can use it in many other programming areas which get you a more tools to take on the many day to day challenges of the programming world. Google should go back to the drawing board and redisign this course. What a bum!,True

It seems to be a well-structured course and doesn't require any specific IT or math background knowledge. One thing I would recommend is that you can actually audit the course, do the ungraded quizzes, then pay to complete the graded assignments. You can do this to study for as long as you want and pay very little as well. I personally prefer to go through and digest every small details so completing this course in 6 months seems like a good option for me. Trying to complete it quickly can be counter productive.",True
