IF your employer treats you well, you're compensated fairly, and the perks are good, then your employer should always be given the opportunity to negotiate to keep you. There is something in the argument that yes, they should have already been doing more--but communication is a two-way street. If you're searching for more opportunity and would like to pursue it within the company you work for, let your management team know you're willing to take on additional responsibilities. They may be thinking of doing something and looking outside for a candidate because they don't know someone on the team already is interested.",True

You are doing everybody looking to get into this industry a great service and you deserve any and all success that comes your way.  I also want to focus on what you said about PwC and how they wanted you to shut down your channel due to a ""conflict of interest"". This is interesting (and a bit unsettling) because this has happened to at least one other prominent Youtuber called ""Techlead"". He was fired from Facebook with the reason cited being that his channel was a ""conflict of interest"".  At the risk of sounding naive, stupid, or uninformed... can you explain why your channel would be a conflict of interest? Is it because:  A) They are worried that you will directly or indirectly ""advertise"" for competitors or leak sensitive information?  B) You giving tutorials and giving tips on the data analyst hiring process will cause a greater influx of uniform-and-impressive-looking job applications and will put greater pressure on HR.  C) The opposite of B): your videos will encourage people to try for higher prestige companies like Google or Abbots, thereby decreasing the number of prospective applicants.  D) Some other factors I never thought of.  I apologize for this long comment AND for asking a question whose answer could possibly taint your professional persona. It's just what you said about the interview with PwC kind of alarmed me. I have just finished reading 1984 by George Orwell, so I guess I'm a little paranoid :-D.  Keep up the good work!",True
