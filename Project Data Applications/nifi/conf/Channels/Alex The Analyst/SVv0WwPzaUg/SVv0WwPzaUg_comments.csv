@michelemoneywell8765,2021-05-30T01:15:00Z,0,"I have an ethical question for you Alex. What if you found out the company you are working for was using your work product for evil purposes. I can't think of an example, maybe you can. Something that would lead to deaths, or like rounding up unvaccinated for FEMA camps or children for trafficking or figuring out the best money laundering -- I don't know good examples. Would you quit, even though the pay was high? Would you collect evidence first? Or would you stay there, justifying your part wasn't evil. This is a serious question, and I'd like to know what kind of person I listen to.",True

I just transitioned from a Data Analyst to Product Owner, I landed a remote job as one for a Blockchain technology company and I fell in love with the role for 3 reasons:  1. I am the client/users voice inside the company (client-facing role) 2. I get to coordinate and communicate with a cross-functional team and learn from their expertise in totally different areas (I love learning new things). 3. I get to lead a product vision and launch it into the market (I love innovation).  I'm currently working on my Medium blog and Youtube channel about it. You inspired me to do so.",True
