Then I saw that on UDEMY, there are three begginer courses that stick out beside the one provided by you: 1. SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence  by 365 DataScience, they even have their own platform where they provide courses structured in modules and a verifiable certificate.  2.

Learn visualization: Tableau, Power BI 4. Learn to query: SQL 5. Learn Git and GitHub (putting projects there will help build portfolio)  A note to all: don't pay full price for Udemy courses. Wait until they go on sale, then buy a couple/few to hold you over until the next sale. If you are low income, Coursera offers financial aid. Have to answer 3 essay questions and wait 15 days to know whether approved or not. Have to apply for each course. Get on mailing lists of various learning platforms. Datacamp recently had 3 days free. Also, the first module of most courses is always free. Check out bundle packages on TNW (deals . thenextweb . com I think.)
