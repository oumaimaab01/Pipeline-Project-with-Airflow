When I moved on to intermediate I understood that Im stucked a bit. In MySQL for instance FULL OUTER JOIN doesn't work, only  LEFT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Then I got that in this course you use SQL Server Management Studio. For such beginners as me It could be nice to get the information in the beginning, that you use a slightly different version. I managed to install the SQL Server MS. But sadly I can't download the database Parks_and_Recreation into the SQL Server MS. it shows different errors, so there is no posibility to try all commands you use in your video.

I have already finished your Power BI for Beginners and now into SQL. Though I have already finished the Khan Academy lessons on SQL, I found that there are difference in the codes used in SQLServer compared to I think SQLlite in Khan Academy.

Your explanation helped me a lot in understanding the concepts of LEFT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, RIGHT-OUTER JOIN AND INNER JOIN. There's one thing I am not sure of though.

In other words, i get the idea of sql queries, where, order by, but what the heck do you do with the results?

@rockymarquiss8327,2023-01-10T18:07:49Z,0,Other databases have an exception join - I don't see that in MS SQL. An Exception join returns data that ONLY exists in one table.  Arguably this can be accomplished in the where clause of an outer join - testing for the keys of the secondary table being null but having it part of the join clause is cleaner. Am I missing something and it exists and not seeing it? For example:  select * from OWNER CUROWN left exception join NEWOWNER newown on CUROWN.OWNERID = NEWOWN.OWNERID would produce rows in the OWNER table that DOES NOT have any data in NEWOWNER.   This can be simulated by: select * from OWNER CUROWN left outer join NEWOWNER newown on CUROWN.OWNERID = NEWOWN.OWNERID where NEWOWN.OWNERID is null  But if you have multiple conditions in the ON clause you have to test that EACH key is null.   In this example it returns values where the owners have not changed.,True

@rondraughon5572,2022-07-15T21:32:06Z,0,"If you'd like to shorten your code so you don't have to write EmployeeDemographics or EmployeeSalary every time for everything, you can use an alias by adding ed (for EmployeeDemographics) after EmployeeDemographics in the FROM cluase and es (for EmployeeSalary) after EmployeeSalary in the JOIN clause. Your code for the RIGHT JOIN where you have 5 columns selected would look like this:    SELECT ed.EmployeeID, ed.FirstName, ed.LastName, es.JobTitle, es.Salary FROM EmployeeDemographics ed RIGHT OUTER JOIN EmployeeSalary es          ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID  INSTEAD OF THIS  SELECT EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID, EmployeeDemographics.FirstName, EmployeeDemographics.LastName, EmployeeSalary.JobTitle, EmployeeSalary.Salary FROM EmployeeDemographics  RIGHT JOIN EmployeeSalary          ON EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID  Much easier, don't you think?",True

However, in the final section here finding the average salary of a salesman you used an inner join which eliminated the salesman salary from the employeesalary table because it didn't have an employee ID. By not including the value (NULL, Salesman, 43000) , it skewed the average salesman salary by only evaluating those salesmen with matching employee ID's from both tables. Value should be 49750 not 52000 and you should have used a FULL OUTER JOIN instead.",True
