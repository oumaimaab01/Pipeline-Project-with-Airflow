@RyanNolanData,2024-04-10T13:31:11Z,0,"Great to see your insights on being promoted. I've been in the Data Field for almost 3 years now and this has been my progression.  1. First Data Analyst Job. I got this a year after college. With covid happening in 2020, I wanted to try to sell SEO marketing and I failed horribly. Had a degree in Electrical Engineering which helped me land the first job, but also feels like it was a giant waste of time 2. After my first big project at the new job, I got a $100 a month raise. 3. Started working a ton with the executive team, and the company moved me from Marketing to Engineering for reporting. Recieved a 10k raise. 4. There was no room to grow (Told no use cases for python or Data Science in the company + no raises), looked for a new job. Landed a Job at a fintech (first 6 figure job) where I could grow into a Data Science role + use python 5. My Department got obliterated, boss left, every other data person went to different departments or left the company. Stayed in my role and learned as much as I could about Mode, DBT, Streamlit, Langchain so that I could build internal BI tools to optimize the teams procedures + reporting (which was almost nonexistant or incorrect) 6. Title change to Data Scientist (Still only data person in a full Risk/Underwriting Dept), and 3% raise (not happy about the raise part, especially taking on multiple peoples old work)  I didn't study new Data concepts at my first job, I thought I would be able to learn at the job which was a huge mistake in growth. When I started looking for my next job, I made a YouTube channel to force myself to study. I should also note, I was able to land my 2 jobs through networking as well. My Fintech job I got through a connection on my sports card YouTube channel. Really curious how connections will help on the data side of things. It's almost a year with this channel and have made over 100 vids, almost at 6k subs.  Anyways watched your vids when I was trying to land my first job, it was super helpful.",True
