@Ananya.Worley,2024-05-04T18:59:56Z,1,"Love this, thank you for being so transparent! I completely agree that switching companies is the most surefire way to increase your income but I was wondering if you had any suggestions for situations where the company you're working at is amazing, lets you work remotely, and gives you an above industry average salary increase annually.   I know that I am capable of earning more if I switched jobs, but the current job market is terrifying and I don't want to risk ending up at a company that doesn't give me as much flexibility/benefits. I'd love to hear your thoughts, thank you!",True
