@ajaypatro1554,2023-10-29T18:36:06Z,0,"Hy, Nicholas, Myself Ajay I've been meaning to reach out to you for quite some time now, I wanted to know opinion on my roadmap for Data Science for Geospatial Industry, I will not waste your time I will share what I am doing write now and what are my goals are and please give me idea what to do:  I have a postgraduate degree in geoinformatics, but I've had trouble finding a suitable job in the field of spatial analysis. This is mainly because I lacked Python skills. However, as soon as I started the CS50 Python course, I realized there's a whole world of spatial analytics out there (which is essentially like supercharged spatial analysis with data science). I'm currently enrolled in CS50 Python and plan to take CS50 SQL next. After that, I wanted to know if Google's Advanced Data Analytics course is a good choice for someone like me who doesn't have a fundamental understanding of data science and statistics. I'm also interested in statistical learning, but I'm not sure how to go about it since it's currently in R on edX. I did find a book in Python for it, though.  I also have an interest in computer vision applications in the field of earth observation and machine learning for spatial data patterns. Essentially, I want to do what Foursquare and CartoDB are doing in spatial data science, with a focus on image processing for earth observation (although this part can wait for about a year).",True

Also many of the jobs I applied to could have cared less about the actual certificate I received and more about my portfolio and me actually being able to demonstrate the skills required. I guess what you're paying for is having most of the learning material in one location and prepared for you rather than hoping all over the internet learning from different sources.

I am a hands on learner and this helps.  I am following the IBM YouTube Bootcamp as well for the explaining of the verbage, that way I get both.  Can't wait for your similar upload that you mentioned in your other video, IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME.  THANKS AGAIN.  YOU ROCK❤💪🏼🔥 Oh yeah, I bought Cole's book😂",True
