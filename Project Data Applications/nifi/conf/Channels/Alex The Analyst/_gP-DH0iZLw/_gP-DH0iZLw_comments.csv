Something like Chief Digital Officer? I am working in a data tech company that provides analytics to the Oil & Gas sector and currently doing my masters in DA. I don't like being an analyst (aka doing frustrating manual work) since most of my career is client-facing roles (sales, customer success, etc). I prefer to be in an executive role where I can lead a company towards becoming more  Data Driven that can lead to its success. Would be nice to know your point of view on that. Thanks again!",True

As an undergrad graduating in 2022, I have taken an interest in a more data scientist track compared to a data analyst track. Since data scientist roles more often than not require master's degrees, should someone look to become a data analyst initially and eventually become a data scientist later in their career, or would you suggest a different path for someone looking to become a data scientist?",True
