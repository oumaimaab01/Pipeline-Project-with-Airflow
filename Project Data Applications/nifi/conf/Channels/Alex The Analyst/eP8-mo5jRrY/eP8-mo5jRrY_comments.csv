@douglasmcgalliard9996,2022-11-17T17:15:26Z,1,"I would like to know how completing a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating your skills and knowledge is going to equate to 5 years experience? because no one hires anyone in this field with less than 5 years experience. They only look at senior level candidates for any of these types of positions. I have been 2 years trying to get a paid position and can't even have a conversation with anyone because I don't have enough work experience. Why would anyone go into such a field when there is no opportunity?  I get calls all day long from recruiters and it is the same old thing ""you don't have enough work experience"" or we need this skill or experience in this particular industry etc. It is a waste of time!",True
