@mandyglynn1538,2023-01-29T19:37:35Z,0,"Hi, Alex!  Did you ever figure out why your Tableau wasn't connecting in your portfolio?  I am having the same issue and haven't been able to find a solution yet.  Thanks!",True

@trentsmith8427,2023-01-22T13:57:33Z,1,"Hi Alex - could you discuss or touch on the stress that goes into a data analytics job? Obviously, there is going to be stress in virtually any field and any role, but would you consider Data Analytics a ""stressful job."" I have a below-average tolerance for stress and was wondering if this field would be something to look into. Thanks so much!",True
@inkoso,2023-01-21T18:49:12Z,5,too busy -- none of the dashboards are useful in a business context nor do they convey anything easily digestible. none of this applicable to a business setting. i wouldn't hire this guy.,True
@RC-fi8nn,2023-01-20T18:48:23Z,0,"Hi Alex, love your videos. I am currently seeking a career change and - as an introvert - am wondering if data analytics if right for me.  What would you think about a career in data analytics for introverts and people who prefer to work independently?  Now, I am fine working with people, but I do my best work when working independently and it's where I'm happiest.  Would you consider doing a video on this topic?  Thank you! üôè",True
@KBarn-lo7ip,2023-01-19T20:43:13Z,0,I have a question. What are the chances that a job and Dan and Alex will be replaced by AI?,True

@TheDankrista,2023-01-18T16:48:13Z,1,I just joined the Maven Bootcamp.  Thanks for this breakdown Alex.,True
@paulsamson1430,2023-01-18T11:21:38Z,1,"I already built a portfolio with GitHub from your previous video, do you think having this would also be a good idea or have either one is good enough?",True
@elmago1298,2023-01-18T04:20:53Z,2,"I might not be the best at internetting, but i just clicked on the link above for Maven and their website is all kinds of jacked up.  All other websites I've visited tonight are normal.  The Maven site is just completely off: the structure is off, there's no organization, the pictures have no scale...i mean, i was looking at someone's eyeball zoomed in like 10000%.  It's unusable right now.  Has anyone else seen this tonight?",True
@onseayu,2023-01-17T22:04:04Z,19,"Hi Alex!  Not sure if you take suggestions for videos, but I was hoping for advice on getting a data analyst role with no professional experience at all.  Because that's the position I'm in, and on top of that, no degree or relevant work history.  But I do have a portfolio, and have won multiple data challenges. I've been applying for weeks with zero responses.  Not sure where to go from here, so I'm open to any advice, on any aspect. I know it's not exactly the same situation you were in, but hopefully you have some insights you'd be able to share.  Thanks!",True

@traetrae11,2023-01-17T16:55:41Z,1,I like this review and want to check it out for myself now. I think a better option would be to provide a test out option for a small fee that would allow them to verify that you actually have those skills. Once you pass the badge would be added.,True
@usmanmalik4024,2023-01-17T16:35:19Z,5,Was desperately waiting for this because I am just going to start with the portfolio after having completed all the projects so i wanted to ask you which one is better github or maven analytics for creating a portfolio so please tell me thanks,True
@sandipsarker5970,2023-01-17T15:30:13Z,1,Hi Alex. Make a video on Data analyst remote jobs that can be done from anywhere in the world. Plz,True
@oluwafemihunsu6200,2023-01-17T15:20:08Z,1,"Hi Alex,thanks for this update. I just want to know,as a biginner is it OK to specify that you are in data analyse intern on your resume?",True
@jbpauler,2023-01-17T14:54:09Z,13,"This is a great review Alex!   Especially appreciate the feedback you provided, which I will address here:   1. Noting the additional fields as 'required' is a great suggestion, and just an oversight on our part. We will update it. Thanks for calling it out!   2. Adding additional skills / certificates that are non-Maven to that skills section is something we've talked about, but didn't make it into this MVP launch. I agree with you, opening that field up would be smart. We're still debating this one internally (what to do, how it should look, how open vs prescriptive, etc), so can't promise quick changes. But expect changes here at some point.   3. Not sure what happened with your Tableau embed attempt. At first glance, I can't see anything you did wrong. I know this is working for other folks, so need to give it a closer look. It's possible there was a bug when you were trying this (still a very new product!) or maybe I am just missing something. We have this embed guide to help folks through the different embed options:   https://help.mavenanalytics.io/en/articles/6792558-how-do-i-create-a-great-portfolio-project#h_6ed62fc1b2  Consider this product a work in progress. We love feedback like this, so keep it coming!!",True
@Cameron_David_,2023-01-17T14:37:00Z,1,Its looks good but its kind of using your profile to promote their services which is not so great for a personal portfolio.,True

@DJAlstein,2023-01-17T13:24:29Z,10,"Hey Alex love the review, i just noticed something maybe you would like to be improved. sometimes when you talk a bit louder the mic is clipping, one way to deal with this is to set the mic to -6 DB at its loudest when you are recording and then use a compressor later on in post production to make it louder that way its consistent, loud and clear. these are my 2 cents. love ya buddy keep being awesome",True
@techampgaming6001,2023-01-17T13:04:46Z,1,Thanks Alex!,True
