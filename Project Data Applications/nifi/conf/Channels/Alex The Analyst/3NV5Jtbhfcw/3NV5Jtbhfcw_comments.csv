@thomaslarson9662,2023-11-29T17:49:01Z,1,"@AlexTheAnalyst Myself and a couple other participants were having trouble with the ""Total Purchased"" populating as ""Sum of Total Purchased"" and it is providing a different value. I noticed that when you click on the visualization for the card, Power BI automatically applied a filter ""DE"" to the output and when remove ""filters affecting this visual"" it corrects the error. You can then rename ""Sum of Total Purchased"" to match the demonstration in the video.",True
