@susanwangcfa3685,2023-01-08T20:49:24Z,0,"Alex, you look much better without those glasses =).  What I do not understand about this example is:  Does it assume that the user is aware (or unaware) of the missing data?  I would have to think that if one was aware of the missing data, the better option is to simply update the original data source, so if the user were unaware of the data issue, what is your suggestion as to how this would materialize during the selection of Joins?  (In this example, I believe you were searching for it only because you were aware of it, so just questioning how obvious it might be for the average, unaware user.). Thank you.",True
