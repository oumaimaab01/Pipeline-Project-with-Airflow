@SlishSlosh,2023-09-20T04:45:40Z,0,"If you want the strongest chance of getting a data analyst job while spending the least amount of time and spending the least amount of money, well keep dreaming. But through WGU you can realistically graduate start to finish with a bachelors in 1 year. Thatâ€™s $8k in tuition I think. Youâ€™ll have a solid amount of information and a solid foundation to learn new things as they show up in the tech world.",True

@saverna1,2023-08-29T09:48:10Z,4,I save up for grad school courses through my University after spending time studying free content. It's a great way to network and build a formal portfolio along with building a formal foundation that is recognized internationally. Many courses cover memberships to professional publications and groups that would be out of a typical self study persons reach. 10 courses is a Masters degree and you can usually take your time to do a few certifications before rolling your experiences into a degree,True

@kimmaekhyun,2023-08-24T13:28:34Z,3,What a coincidence! I'm planning on joining a 12 weeks (345 hrs) data science bootcamp that cost about 1300 usd (in my country that's like 3-4 months worth of income) with an internship & job connector program.
