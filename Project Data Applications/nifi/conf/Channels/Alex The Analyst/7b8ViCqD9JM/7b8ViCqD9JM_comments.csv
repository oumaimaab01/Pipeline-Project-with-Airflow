@apeekintime,2024-03-28T04:42:02Z,0,"Recruiters are great - but they really don't accomplish a ton until you get into more senior roles. The biggest advice for a job seeker - APPLY ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE.   I landed so many more interviews by applying directly with employer than I ever did applying through LinkedIn or any other job board. My hit rate with corporate job boards was easily 50x higher than any third party job board.   When you start applying for manager, or executive roles then you really need to have a recruiter working for you. Often the recruiters for management and higher roles have a connection to the hiring manager/ELT/Board and that will make all the difference.   My last job change took me from a senior analyst role to a director/senior manager role because I had a good recruiter working with me.",True
