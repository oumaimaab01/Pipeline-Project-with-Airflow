@vonillabrownsugar,2023-04-22T04:02:58Z,0,"I'm currently interviewing for another data analyst role. I rarely ever use SQL in my role, mostly use Tableau, GTM or GA Looker Studio, other visual tools. I've had 12 years in creating high ROI digital marketing campaigns,  so when I became a Data Analyt,  it still baffles me why there needs to be so many visualization tools to make educated marketing decisions on how to optimize campaigns  (Python, SQL,  GA4, R, Tableau, Power BI, etc, etc). Truely, in all my years doing digital analytics,  we rarely ever used all these tools. So many exceptional data anaysts are passed over because the hiring manager is hung up on specific tools that are rarely used and specific tasks  can be taught to almost anyone. It feels like hiring managers are looking for unicorns, but they just a need a reliable horse üòÇ",True

@oyindamolatomoye6520,2021-11-18T21:46:43Z,18,"Alex, I appreciate your mentorship on YouTube to those of us looking to break into data analytics.  However, I'm a Nigerian (Africa) where the unemployment rate is sky-high. Because of this, many companies list DA Job descriptions exactly like this. In fact, many give you age limits!! They tell you to have 3-5 yes experience as a Junior DA. They expect you to have a Post-grad degree in statistics, economics, business, CS et all making it hard to break into the DA field in my country.   Currently. I just finished a DA bootcamp with a start-up and I'm about starting a 1 month internship with that start-up.   I have my Bachelors and Masters degree in Pharmacology. Switched into DA too late (I'm almost 30).   Really need your candid advice and encouragement because what works in your home country - USA may not work in Africa. We don't have the luxury of choice here. We take what jobs we can get even if the envt is toxic and the manager is Lucifer's elder bro.   So, what are your thoughts? How can you tailor your videos to account for those in Africa?",True

@akixiang,2021-11-18T18:27:50Z,22,"This post made me laugh, my company have a data analyst position, the task just produce some simple dashboards from Excel reports each period, but the JD required all data science skills you can think of, it is only because the hiring manager had no idea what was actually needed, so copied from all job ads related to data analyst!",True
@rookiebobplayer244,2021-11-18T17:47:50Z,20,"One general one to look out for , ask within this position, who is the oldest member that is in that exact role.

@meliwazhere,2021-11-18T17:34:45Z,6,"I agree with you 100%! Places looking for junior ""rockstars"" ultimately want you to do everything and don't want to teach you the skills you don't necessarily have (like Python).  I think it's important for people to check Glassdoor on interview reviews and job reviews. For example, is there a live coding session or is it a ""homework assignment""? (Where the company tries to steal your work).  My company has very bad reviews on their interview process (due to a homework assignment that can take 3+ hours) and then they wonder why applicants are dropping out of the process!",True
@BummerSlug,2021-11-18T16:30:47Z,30,"100% correct from my experiences. I appreciate that you mention to still apply, just ask about it then make the call.   I try to ask indirectly about work load.
