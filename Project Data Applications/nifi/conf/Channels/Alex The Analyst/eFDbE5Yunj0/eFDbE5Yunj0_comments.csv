I am currently doing this right now and some of the courses, such as, 3 and 4, are challenging as the tutors are disinterested in teaching, does not explain complicated concepts properly and you must have a good knowledge of python programming before enrolling. Also, the 4 and a half/5 star review of the course is an over statement. Anyone planning on doing this, I would highly recommend you to have a good read of the comments and reviews.

Honestly these courses are so buggy, the lessons are either oversimplified or too complicated, I don't feel like I learned a thing, particularly in some of the Python courses. The whole process was incredibly frustrating. The moderators are helpful and answer your questions quickly and fix your problems, but having so many issues is really disruptive to the learning process and I feel like I'm going to have to do a lot more independent studying to actually learn the skills this course was supposed to teach me. On its surface it looks clean and polished, but I don't recommend taking it as it's so surfacy and you'll end up just having to take another one anyway.",True

Honestly, Excel, and Cognos related courses are great! However, Python part is not so useful in terms of getting real coding skills, and I enrolled to the course mainly because of Python for Data Analysis. The problem (if briefly) is that it doesn't really explain the logic of coding, which would allow you to continue learning by yourself further. Instead it just give commands and you need just run them. They skip many parts while explaining how codes works.   I hope at least the Certificate itself would have an impact in the eye of employer.  But if you are really honest (I really hope so), and the job prospect is so indeed good with the the certificate I feel very optimistic.",True

I must admit it got super hard from course 4 - Python for Data Science, AI & Development. The learning curve is exponential. Each of those 7-15 min videos took me 4-5 hours to complete with contact pauses-plays. The Python in this course is definitely not for beginners. I completed the 4th course just for the sake of it but I don't believe I have mastered any of the skills.

My tip is to practice it using your terminal and not just the jupyter notebooks they provide.   Also thanks Alex!

@rumaisay746,2021-01-27T17:01:32Z,1,"I will be honest here Alex, i love all ur content. But when i went to see the reviews on individual courses, they were disappointing. I will still do the course though and makeup for all the lousy tutorials from here and there. But not just from IBM on coursera. This certificate though and these concepts in sequence would matter for me. Thats for sure. At the end of the day there is no one rule, and we all need to look for what works best for us. We should alwys look for reviews to  have realistic expectations.",True

@sfundomabaso3200,2021-01-27T04:00:29Z,2,I'm glad you touched on this. I took a data science course using R since I'm more comfortable with R and I got bored along the way as I was learning nothing new. I found that it's mostly everything I've already done in 1st year university can you recommend some for graduate students who are trying to land a job please,True

@SocalNewsOne,2021-01-26T14:59:50Z,1,Thank you for sharing your insights into this field.  I am an old timer who is trying to change careers very late in my working life.  Graduated with a business/accounting degree and moved immediately to computer support.  I finally realized that I thrive on problem solving; the bigger the better.  Per your recommendation I have enrolled in the IBM Data Analyst program.  Just finishing up the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree.  Was not sure about moving on to their Data Analyst program but even with their current discount they are $200/month.,True
@aayushivats365,2021-01-26T14:53:59Z,1,"Hello Sir, I started with the data analyst course but switched to the data science course since use of statistics  and specifically wanting to learn R interested me(I am pursuing my major in economics currently with minors in statistics and mathematics). Can I still get some data analyst roles? Or should I switch back to the data analyst course? While comparing I realized that the data analyst course has excel which the data science course does not have and lacks the machine learning aspect. I am comfortable with excel given my practical labs in the college statistics courses I took. So is the data science course the right choice to get some entry level data analyst roles? Thank you so much in advance sir.",True
@sergioramos3437,2021-01-26T14:44:13Z,0,"Phew , glad I didn't waste my time taking this lol ... With the peer graded assignments, it varies ... I did my best to look over like 90% of the assignments I graded in detail; but it gets exhausting lol .. I've been graded harshly, and I've been graded lazily by peers when taking that course.. also worth noting, if you take this specialization, youre basically half way done with their data science specialization as well !",True
@Redmonkey118,2021-01-26T14:41:16Z,13,you‚Äôve really convinced me to try being a data analyst. Thankfully I have an IT B.S Degree so I hopefully will land a job after studying & learning.,True
