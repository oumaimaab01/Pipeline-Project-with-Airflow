@ericfiumano4694,2024-05-14T15:23:49Z,0,"My 2 cents:  in the information era it's very important to show the most you can, too.   I'm no developer or what, but I've been wanted for a position where I had to use Python to retrieve data and, you know what?, I was beeing chosen even if I genuinely told the co-founder of the company that I just used Python to run some exercise using pandas and numpy but, since I had never had a true reason to use it, I've never got myself involved in deeper learning.   In that case he was happy cause could see a person that had other experiences but was also open to learn more and more.   Then, also, to surprise them!   For the same company I had to attend 4 interviews and, in one, I was asked too whether I could use an aumation tool that could (can't remember which one) and I tested it in the 2 previous days. So, I had no relevance of such info on my CV, but when I had the interview I said...""I've never worked with such tool, but I tested a couple of times and could create a dashboard and send it to emails given some rules.."".   So, maybe you can't now, today, but this doesn't mean you can't learn it! :)",True

@AventuraAnalitica,2024-05-09T19:59:20Z,2,"Hi Alex,  I blew a SQL technical interview recently not because I don't know SQL but because I was really nervous and unprepared.  After looking at the questions calmly after the interview I realized they really weren't that difficult.   Do you think companies keep that on your ""permanent record"" meaning it might affect other jobs I might apply for within that company?  What's your experience?",True
@malcorub,2024-05-09T19:01:02Z,3,"With my last two healthcare analyst remote interviews for two different healthcare systems, I actually worked directly with the hiring manager and never spoke with a recruiter.  1.  First one started with email from the manager followed by a 30 minute phone call with the manager followed by a proctored SAS-SQL technical test on paper/panel interview that lasted 2 hours the following week.  2.  The second one also started with an email from the manager followed by a proctored SQL technical on paper.  From there,  if I passed I was invited to a formal interview with hiring manager and director.  From there a panel interview from the team the following week.",True

@johnvak7390,2024-05-08T05:32:16Z,0,"No freaking way people have data analyst jobs and tell interviewers they have 3+ year in SQL but cant do simple joins and aggregation. This guy probably has a job as a data analyst too. Why the hell is it so hard for me to get a interview?! Oh wait, it's because I have no work experience, and my portfolio is not even glanced over. Great  P.S. I later found out Alex said he lied his ass off >_<",True
