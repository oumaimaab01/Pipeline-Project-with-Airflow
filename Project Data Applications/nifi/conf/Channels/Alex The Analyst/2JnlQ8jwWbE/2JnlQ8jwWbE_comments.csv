@NathanEckelTV,2022-04-13T11:49:23Z,1,"I could be wrong @Alex, to me the last couple of these seem like culture / SME onboarding issues that seep into a very new industry.   3.  No Scope / Loose Scope with frequent backend revisions 4. ""Priority"" / ""Urgent"" Projects that aren't utilized/viewed  Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) can often be notoriously unaware of how unmanageable they can be and the effect this has upon the team of professionals who work around them.    A couple ideas based on your sharing here - which I really appreciate. Might part of a solution be to simply be data driven on the back side of a project?    1. If this is ""urgent"", could we insert language to that effect into the scope document (or create such a document) and then continue tracking afterward to see if/how it was utilized.    - (For at least our internal use) Did the urgency on the front end match the degree of utilization on the back end? - If there isn't much scope on the front end how could we document this and have the stakeholder signoff on it?  2. If this seems too confrontational or unorthodox could we present this resource-enhancing idea beforehand to our lead or executive who we are most accountable to?  I have seen in my experience as an instructional designer working with SMEs that guardrails and boundaries are really helpful - exactly the same way as a highly paid consultant would deftly manage the expectations and avoid getting into a place where they are stretched too thin.  Your video *did not* come off that way at all - however reading between the lines - this was invaluable for me and other newer folks to see that SME management is always a vital part of the job - much appreciated!",True

Drove me up a wall. I kept getting ""Meets All Expectations"" ratings at each performance review cycle and my manager (who couldn't write a single line of SQL btw) kept telling me that I needed to ""make more of an impact"" in order to get promoted to the next level.

@arcadevampire,2022-04-13T00:42:17Z,5,"Regarding your 4th point, after a two decades of analytics experience (marketing science at an advertising agency), I start with the mindset that my work may not be used. For me, when it's not used it's most likely it doesn't support the stakeholders proposed plans. They are quite likely to have commissioned a few pieces of analytics from different angles to back up a viewpoint or story, thus want it there to be able to pick and choose. I don't take it personally. However, knowing this, I'm always comfortable pushing back on timings. I tend to find when someone wants something today they actually need in a week or even longer.",True

Also beware of those informal ""side"" requests to ""write a quick script"" for someone.

Relating to your point on ""my work didnt get looked on"", what I H-A-T-E as a modeller is when one does extremely complex and sophisticated techniques to solve a very difficult modelling problem, and people dont understand nor appreciate the work and effort. They treat it as ""nothing"", as ""paper"", as if its easier than what it is while its not. And on the data side, what I hate is when one has a stressed PM who does not understand data nor have a realistic understanding on how complex and time-consuming certain moments can be. It all boils down to appreciation of others work. I gladly get deep into details and fix and problem-solve, but its demotivating when one does it to someone who doesnt appreciate the craftsmanship and effort put into it.",True

A lot of the time though I prefer to just put on some music and hack away at some SQL for a while.

@JustAn0therSoul,2022-04-12T11:57:32Z,4,"From a spiritual point of view and personal experience i would recommend not to fake laughs and not to put on a mask at work. I know its so common, and also kind of expected but not truely being yourself is draining too and have the ""mask"" of being happy or whatever on is bringing more conflict than just being yourself. If you have a bad day and feel drained and someone makes a joke and you just dont feel it, there is no harm in not laughing, if you dont find it geniuely funny, dont laugh, if anyone asks (sometimes they ask by giving you a look) you just state your point, im having bad day, its not my kind of humor and so on. And this can be applied to various situation not just faking laughs, people are sometimes emotionally very demanding (often without realizing it) , sometimes a compromise is okay but sometimes people want more and more over time, it starts little and one day they demand a million things and when you then create some distance to not being drained so much, they perhaps feel hurt and then they blame you. I think its better to start clear of, compromising is ok at times but if things get to much it should be named like, ""yea i can work a few hours more this week, but i dont want it to become a habbit"" just to have a example situation. But you need to be on your toes as many of these things happen more in the subconscious than in the conscious mind and it takes a little bit of sensitivity to communicate these things.",True
