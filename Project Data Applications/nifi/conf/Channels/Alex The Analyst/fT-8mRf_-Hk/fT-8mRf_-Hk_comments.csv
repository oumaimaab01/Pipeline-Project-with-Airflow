@kre45,2024-05-17T00:34:43Z,1,Just started learning sql on Udemy this week and I am doing pretty good so far with answering your interview questions,True
@TheSupersayan6,2024-04-12T13:56:37Z,0,"i'm a little confused about the Senior Citizen Discount question, i've seen the solution it says to use the timestampdiff but is there any alternate way to solfe this question in mysql?   #SELECT customer_id  #FROM customers  #where 2023 - year(birth_date) >= 55 #where date_sub('2023-01-01',birth_date) >= 55 #order by customer_id asc;   i've tried a few different ways but not getting the desired output  thanks.",True
@adhamazzam433,2024-03-05T13:53:51Z,0,"Thank you very much, Alex! I just finished watching all your boot camp videos. They are really very helpful for beginners. And thank you for recommending this Analystsbuilder, which is really useful for practicing ❤❤❤really appreciate your help and hard work 😊",True
@idwtv534,2024-02-17T05:50:41Z,0,Is it just me or does anyone else also feels these are beginner level problems?,True
@malcorub,2024-02-08T23:57:52Z,1,"Some of the easy questions start turning into medium questions when you consider the nested functions like with the COSTCO ROTISERIE CHICKEN scenario.                                                                   SELECT ROUND(CAST(SUM(lost_revenue_millions) AS DECIMAL), 0) AS Total_Loss  FROM sales;    I have an easier time with temp tables, stored procs, creating and inserting into tables than I do nested functions.  But still, great learning tool Alex!!!!!",True
@mohamedtarek2056,2024-01-27T16:18:18Z,0,This is really a great platform,True
@BATMAN-sh8mm,2024-01-12T13:16:08Z,0,Honestly these questions are easy level,True

@kehindekehinde9719,2024-01-08T13:58:20Z,1,Thanks for sharing always,True
@reliablevariable1615,2024-01-07T04:00:28Z,2,"As these interview questions get more difficult, it also gets more important to validate the data. In the second example, the data set is small enough to visually confirm that the error is uniform.  If that dataset was 10,000+ rows long, it will not be practical nor would it be possible to validate the data visually. I’d be asking what types of assumptions do I have with the text and how do I write queries that would check against those assumptions. (E.g., do the names have any trailing or leading space? Is the naming convention for the error always a concatenation of the ID at the beginning or can the error show as First Name and then ID?)  Depending on how big your testing dataset is and who you are speaking to, the thought process can be scaled up or down accordingly.",True
@ivanko-nebo,2024-01-06T19:14:35Z,1,"Hi Alex.   There is an issue in ""Senior Citizen Discount"" moderate SQL question. The task says ""If a customer is 55 or above they qualify"" - this should be meaning "">="" condition. But it is not accepted as correct by the system. I get ""your solution is correct"" only if I change to "">"", which contradicts the task.",True
@rebekahmenn2118,2024-01-06T17:10:19Z,2,"This is great! I'm taking the free Harvard SQL course online, and seeing that these queries are medium-difficulty is encouraging to me... everything made sense and is very straightforward. I really look forward to learning more SQL and getting into this industry!",True
@isaiahsmith6946,2024-01-06T02:14:47Z,0,Thanks for the website Alex. One thing I would say is after doing medium SQL questions on websites such as stratascratch the ones on analyst builder are much easier. I've only been doing SQL a couple months and can get a majority of the medium questions correct on your website but fail to get most of them on other websites. If I'm applying to entry level DA and DS roles should I be ok if I can answer the medium questions on analyst builder?,True
@BeccaNiederkrom1,2024-01-05T21:27:46Z,1,"I've shared your channel with so many Alex, so good! I am an ""old"" lady now lol but thinking of documenting my journey of learning SQL and seeing where it takes me. =)  Maybe inspire some Gen Xers.",True
@AAT977,2024-01-05T20:53:46Z,2,Loving these practice videos,True
@Siejec,2024-01-05T17:49:22Z,1,Alex never fails to show something fresh and interesting! Props!,True
@davita6379,2024-01-05T15:27:35Z,0,"hey,alex for Cake vs Pie Question(Hard) does using Pivot function make more sense?because its advance and its corresponds to level of challenge. this is how i solved it   SELECT date_sold,abs(Cake-Pie),case when Cake > Pie then 'Cake' Else 'Pie' end as type  FROM (     SELECT date_sold,product, coalesce(amount_sold,0)as amount_sold     FROM desserts ) AS SourceTable PIVOT (     SUM(amount_sold) FOR product IN ([Cake], [Pie]) ) AS PivotTable;",True
@MichelleLe-om3fv,2024-01-05T07:29:48Z,0,"I guess everyone has a different definition of easy, medium, and hard because datalemurs easy questions are hard for me 😅. Id say this is easy - medium, too",True
@princesrivastava4475,2024-01-05T04:42:43Z,0,Best thing i learn to write down what we need to do in query 🎉🎉🎉,True
@nicjohnson3812,2024-01-05T04:18:35Z,2,Great content. Your presentation setup and communication skills are superb. One minor suggestion is to be mindful of formatting best practices e.g. each column name on the next line preceeded by its separator comma.    I just unraveled a spaghetti noodle factory of self-taught SQL and the poor formatting added a lot of time.   Reading code that is consistently formatted speeds up an analyst's work and following formatting best practices is a sign of your professionalism in an interview.,True
@wellingtonporto2682,2024-01-05T02:44:52Z,1,"Amazing lesson, Alex! Now, I feel confident to delve deeper into SQL knowledge through the AnalystBuilder website, and more importantly, to excel in SQL interview questions. Thanks a million!",True

@rickball3147,2024-01-04T15:04:22Z,0,Been working through your exercise prompts. I have a quick question. In MSSQL why is it required to CAST int into decimals to conduct equations between columns? It is not required in MYSQL.,True
@stingrgaming,2024-01-04T14:32:13Z,15,I think these should be classified as Easy not Medium,True
