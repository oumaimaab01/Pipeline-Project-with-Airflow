@acs7991,2021-04-11T09:11:27Z,2,Hey I'm a commerce graduate and I've worked in Audit for a year. Do you think it's a good idea to start taking data analytics courses online and try and shift careers due to Automation? Like will analyst jobs be safe from getting replaced in comparison to Audit/Finance jobs. Or is it better to stick to Finance. I'm asking because I really do not have a coding background but I'm seeing a lot of marketing of late about the Analytics field and I'm a bit worried whether to make a  shift or not,True

Will they see such a programme as enhancement to my development experience and as a good start for the DS field ?   Or will they say that it's too late at my age and therefore compare me to much younger graduates in the DS field  in which case they will expect me to take a pay cut ?",True

@jvjjjvvv9157,2021-04-10T16:21:31Z,0,"I would really appreciate any feedback regarding what I'm going to ask, specially from people working in these fields.  I am 36 years old, I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science and I work as a software developer, but I have never been too interested in tech. I am pretty sure I would be better suited for a job involving more analysis and more 'strategical thinking', something that is less technical and more about 'seeing the big picture' than programming is. I am very interested in fields like politics, marketing, social sciences and so on, and I guess there is much use for Big Data in all of these, so I would like to find a job where I can be closer to 'real world' fields like those while still taking advantage of the IT background I already have.  My initial impulse is to go for Data Science because it seems more complex and interesting and it also appears that it would pay better, but I have a slight fear that in the end it might feel too technical: too much about mathematical models and too little about 'real world' analysis or decisions. This makes me want to reconsider and give Data Analysis a second thought, but I'm not sure it would any be better for me in this sense, and honestly I am not as interested in tasks like reports, visualization, etc.  I know it's probably wishful thinking to believe that any stranger could help me much in making up my mind, but...any thoughts?",True

I worked in tech briefly after graduating and worked in data operations (got experience data cleaning, mining and creating dashboards with SQL and Tableau). But I took some time off this past year for a ""gap year"" experience of sorts (I was supposed to be traveling internationally but due to the pandemic I ended up working with kids instead). Currently working as a research assistant and learning more quant and qual analysis tools and have started to realize I want to become a Data Analyst. Due to my non-traditional background I know I have a lot of work to do on my own. I am planning to start the Google Data Analytics Certificate course in coursera soon and start building a portfolio. I hope my random degree doesn't hurt me in my prospects but I figure I can't change the past so I might as well just focus on learning skills through my current job and classes and my own projects and work my way up. I don't want to get a Master's unless absolutely necessary just due to the costs of graduate school. Thank you for your videos they are really helpful in these early days for me!",True

You can become a data analyst from scratch in 1-2 years but a data scientist needs 3-4 years in addition to being very smart.

I don't think I'm selling myself short in terms of technical expertise or intellectual challenge or anything like that but I might be selling myself short in terms of salary.

@troymann5115,2020-10-31T07:02:25Z,4,"Alex how would you define my career?  I have a BS in Chemical Engineering but really should have went into Industrial Engineering.  After many years of coding I found that just solving problems with computers was my thing.  So I became a sort of dual Cloud Architect and BI Developer.  That led to learning the Hadoop and Spark stacks and some lucky breaks into IoT projects.  It was there I started meeting Data Scientists that trained me to do what they wanted.  My job title is frequently ""Python Developer"" or ""Cloud Architect - Data Specialist"" or ""Data Engineer"".  However what I do is work closely on Model Testing, Model Deployment, and Data Cleaning/Data Quality.  Other people write the formal reports but I frequently work on side initiatives at behest of the Analytics team to do forms of EDA in Excel, Spark or just SQL.  Often I rewrite SAS models into Python because other developers rarely understand dataframes.  On the side I do kaggle problems every day except during crunch time.  Most people want to get into different models but I care more about good features and validation.  Business problems implemented in production are more important than POCs.  On many projects I will also help Agile PMs work with the DS team in a way that is not so dysfunctional.    What is my job called?  I thought about getting an MS in data science but most of the concepts I already know.  I can't keep up with the PhDs but they still can teach me stuff.  However I am thinking about getting an Analytics MBA to be able to set people straight because its what I end up doing most of the time.  Someone needs to point out landmines in the data.",True
