I recently finished my courses on SQL and Power BI and when it comes to Power BI (and maybe Tableau as well) I noticed that it has tools for querying/editing/computing data just like SQL. Therefore doesn't it make SQL obsolete since data can be imported directly to Power BI, edited and then visualised? What is the advantage of using SQL for all those computations in this case?",True

@alexiar1470,2021-05-18T12:03:40Z,0,"Hey Alex, Alex here, so i remember watching a video of yours where you discussed how you got into DA, but i‚Äôm curious cuz i never learned if you actually had a degree or certificate in DA.   Also i‚Äôm currently taking the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and i was wondering if you think that is enough to get a job with like Google promises? With a salary of around $68K a year like they say on their site and all. I just wanted to know if i‚Äôm wasting time (and money) paying taking this course only for me to be told i need additional education, work experience etc to actually get a job that won‚Äôt pay me in peanuts. Thanks for your response in advance!   -Alex",True

I am planning to start my career as data analyst and i have a Q, is there any scope of getting job without making a portfolio, i am asking this because my PC is 32bit and it doesn't support any of the applications. So if there is a way to start my career without portfolio then please let me know.",True
