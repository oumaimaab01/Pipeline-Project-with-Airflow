Now, take a look at the ""AVG(Salary)."" This means that for each group (which we found above), find the AVG(Salary) for that group. For this example, this means that for the Sales Department, find the AVG(Salary) for that department. And same for the Marketing Department and Engineering Department.

For example. Item 123 could have lot a, lot b and lot c in 1 location. there might be 2 in one lot, 3 in another and 5 in another.  My solution was to subquery the ""Sum all items in a location"" then ""Inner join"" that sum and join on the Item Location (as that will always be unique)... so instead of having a really large query, this partition by would have shrunk the query down to an easy to read ""Look here is the items, their locations and total sum of all the lots in each location..
