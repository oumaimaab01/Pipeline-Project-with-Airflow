You talking about your family and wanting to provide for them and support them as your number one is what truly resonates with me.

@thepantelemon,2022-11-18T16:46:09Z,0,"Thank you for the video and your perspective! Do you have conflict of interest here? because I would rather say that conclusion you made is overly optimistic towards people who entering or is going to enter the field. I think that senior engineers won't be affected too much because there is a strong demand for good senior level engineers. Mid-level would be probably more affected, but I suppose new grads and switchers will be mostly affected, because they will be competing with people with few years of experience. Why would company ever considered entering level applicants if the company received some amount of applications from people with a few years of experience?",True

I understand the employee position but theres also something you are not seeing as employees. While a lot of employees can perform remotely not every employee can perform remotely. I have employees who lower their performance ever since working remotely. People say, well fire them ! but its not easy because its not easy to replace them and they now it. i have always treated my employees with respect and dignity and treated them fairly, during coronavirus i did not fire ANY employee at all and even when had 0 income for months and months i only lowered their salary for about 4 months or so and after that full salary again. But what they did in exchange? They became less loyal actually, having more than one job and underperforming. I have eventually managed to keep the good ones but my point is, NOT EVERY COMPANY is evil and yet we are all getting treated like we are to blame for the employees misery. I just think theres always going to be people whi will do the least effort possible and trick the system if not supervised and theres also tech  projects which are not all software based.

I'm trying to become an analyst as a recent graduate (MS in Applied Math), and I just wanted to share an experience I had around 4 months ago:  I was referred to a relatively large (at the time, $20B market cap) tech company by a friend. I excitedly interviewed, did quite well, and waited to hear back. Six days passed, and each day their stock price was getting demolished.  On the seventh day since my interview, I received an email saying the position was already filled--""Thanks for your interest!"".

@yasutalodin4266,2022-07-19T19:43:12Z,6,"Even though I 'shored up' my resume by taking a Tableau Analytics course through Emory University when my job got outsourced in September of 2021, I haven't been able to buy a job!  Every 'entry' level position wants you to have a BS in Engineering, Computer Science, Economics, etc. preferably a Masters, know Tableau AND Power BI (expert in DAX), along with Python AND R, SAS (or some other statistical package), Snowflake, data modeling, data warehouse, data lakes and whatever industry proprietary package--all of this with 2 to 5 years experience.  Oh, and you need to be able to do regression modeling as well.  All I'm thinking is ""this unicorn already has a job and if they don't, they're not looking for an 'entry' level position"".  It really has gotten completely out of control with what these companies 'expect' out of an entry level candidate to the point where people like me (someone who knew SQL, Alteryx, Pivot Tables (regular and Power) and Power Query BEFORE I took Tableau Analytics) can't smell a job and yes I'm on linkedin.  No one told me I needed a portfolio so I'm working on that, but I still can't find a job.  As far as people working from home, I come from the Coca-Cola family of companies and worked on their campus.  I get why they want people to come in a couple of times a week.  Home Depot requires that most of their employees come into the office a couple of times a week. If you think about it, a lot of people eventually lost their jobs and can't find work because corporate workers began to telecommute 5 days a week.  The people who work in the cafeteria, the custodial company lost their contract and had to let their crews go, a lot of the security people lost their jobs, the media specialists who ran the town hall meetings got laid off, the receptionists around the campus, the data quality people who ran product-testing, the maintenance people who are now down to the bare bone and on and on and on.  You could make the argument that they should've gone to college and learned blah, blah, blah, but we were glad they were there when we came into the office a couple of times a week.   I guess what I'm saying is that, the world doesn't just revolve around people who can work from home.  Other people can also be negatively affected by those choices, none of which helps the economy.",True

For once, companies have had a hard time filling positions and were forced to address pay, time off, quality of life, work/life balance, etc. It's about effing time. You cited a whole host of excellent reasons for which this was necessary. We spend such a disproportionate % of our lives at work. Shouldn't it be livable?

Torn between help desk or data analyst roles.  I am leaning more into data analyst because U can go into more different areas.

Soo Thankful for channels like yours and others on diverse education to learn on DA and going beyond videos to learn those skillsets.  I appreciate listening to your personal quality of life stuff.
