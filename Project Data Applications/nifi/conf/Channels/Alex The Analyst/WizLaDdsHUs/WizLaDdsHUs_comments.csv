I plan to start your bootcamp videos, and I have actually enrolled in a data analytics grad certificate that starts in Jan. I know a grad certificate probably isnt necessary, but I have a way to get it paid for, so it makes sense for me to do it. I havent seen much discussion on any of the grad certificates. Im curious what you think about those. It looks good- covers SQL, excel, tableau and power BI, and has a whole course on solving problems with data etc. Given that a grad cert would be directly relevant. Would move my education section up on my resume? Doing so through a university has the added benefit of building a network in the feild.",True

I'm a research fellow (PhD in mathematics) hoping to leave academia soon and move to the data analytics or data science field. My past employment features extensive analysis of data using python which I've really highlighted in my cv. Should I still prioritise personal projects or move employment above because of this? Should I include personal projects at all, they are all on my portfolio...?",True

@patrickmeehan6856,2023-03-15T02:28:06Z,0,"Thanks for this!  Bolded key words, key word optimization, and using active verbs to lead off each bullet point will, like you said, help a resume get through those automated first rounds of resume selection at potential places of work.  Is there a way you could re-upload with ""Assistant"" , under Work Experience, spelled correctly?  I imagine most viewers will disregard your advice and just copy and paste it, assuming it is perfect, and an employer will immediately notice this misspelling.     Thanks, also, for the advice about how non-tech workers, like teachers, can produce a tech-adjacent resume.",True

@altair7676,2023-03-14T20:36:45Z,4,Good content as always Alex appreciated. One question: you mentioned putting a link for the projects you have done to prove and maybe do a showcase about it.

@vectoralphaAI,2023-03-14T11:59:01Z,1,OK so here's my question. Both LinkedIn and Indeed have their own free service/ tool to create an automatic resume created from the information from your profile. LinkedIn themselves say that they create the resume for you formatted in such a way to get through all the automate resume checkers most companies use these days. So are these resume tools good to use then?,True
