@JohnnyHandsomeCapital,2022-11-20T12:39:23Z,0,"Thank you for sharing this. Although i personally like udemy as a general idea, everything i found to be usefull on udemy had a completely free course on youtube too. Either for Python, C#, Java, Javascript, Data Analysis, Excel and such. So from my personal point of view udemy really needs youtuber to promote them, because it's youtuber who are the biggest threat to their business modell. You can actually find whole university lectures on youtube for free and if that's not helpfull i don't know what is. Also in combination with a couple of more practical videos like the ones you are providing i can't find real use in paying udemy for something that i can have 1:1 for free on youtube and often from people who know better than the guys on udemy.",True

This was me some years back...we were practically doing all the data cleaning/prep/EDA and simply called it QA. I had no idea until very recently that this is one of the most crucial stages in the DA /DS process! The only thing back then was that I would ask over and over again what all the data we captured through all those expensive sensors would be used for and EVERYONE said they had no idea, only that they knew it would be in a database, end of story! Now that I know about data science and its sub-fields, it's all making sense to me now.",True
