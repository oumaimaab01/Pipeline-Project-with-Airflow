@georgejetson9801,2022-08-27T10:16:05Z,0,"I have a bit of a dilemma. I get advice to not show age but only including the past 10 years of work experience. The thing is, I want to move back to health care analytics and I had solid experience in revenue cycle, a variety of cerner products, medical records, HL7, HMO,  plus a nursing degree.  That experience was 15 to 20 years ago though.  My current experience is government software testing,  but nothing to do with healthcare.",True

I followed your channel religiously and your interview tips really helped me to ace the interview. The best advice you gave was to start doing projects instead of taking class after class because I was one of those people who was focused more on taking class than to practice my skills. After watching that video of yours I started working on my projects instead. I am really grateful to you. Thank you for being part of my journey and for guiding so many people like me. I look forward to learning more from your channel.",True

@justsomeguy1408,2022-04-12T14:05:46Z,3,"For questions about culture, does it hurt to ask questions about specific aspects of the culture?  I recently asked what a company does to support the health and well-being of its employees and to prevent burnout.  I worry that questions like that can make it seem like I'm not willing to put in effort when needed, but at the same time I don't want to jump into a meat grinder.",True

@kyledechau5955,2022-01-19T21:43:43Z,0,"So my current status is I went to college for Stats degree (learned statistics, some analysis, R, and Java) but still feel a bit underprepared. I want to become a data analyst as soon as possible. The problem is the interview. I studied certain questions but I wanna know how to get to a point where I always know what the interviewer is talking about and can give a decent answer. I'll keep studying SAS and SQL but I hear there are a lot of aspects of a data analysis project I am unfamiliar with, so what is the best route I can take to get me to a point where I almost always know what they are talking about?",True

@adityaraizada7614,2021-08-08T09:35:55Z,0,Great work Alex. Thank you so much for these questions. I also think some of the questions may change on the basis of region like people in US definitely would be asking some where different questions compared to people in India.

@aKelev3n,2020-05-13T01:49:33Z,1,"Hi Alex, First of all, thanks for your content. Your videos are very informative and helpful for my research to becoming a data analyst. I am currently an accountant and have recently started looking at becoming an analyst. I did not have a computer science or statistics, or programming background but I know my excel and small amounts of SQL and your videos have encouraged me to start the transition.    I'm currently using Khan Academy for basic SQL, Stat, and looking at Coursera or Udemy for SQL and Python. I am also considering starting my road to get a certificate in Big Data from my local respected community college in my area. I was wondering if you could put out a video about which resources you used when you were self-teaching yourself some of the technical skills. I've also found that not a ton of jobs respect many of these boot camps that are popping up left and right, any opinion on that? Because bootcamps are over promising obviously to learning many items in just 12 weeks.  Again, thanks for the great honest and informative content and you're very encouraging on the career path switch. -AD",True
