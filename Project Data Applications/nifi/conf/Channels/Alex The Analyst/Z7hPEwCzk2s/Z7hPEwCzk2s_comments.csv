@ChikoriTak,2024-05-28T13:30:07Z,0,"Thanks Alex for an amazing course!  I have a little comment regarding the formula. I think ""$"" should be added for a fix range. For example, in tab ""XLookUp"", the range H2:H10 and P2:P10 should be fixed. Therefore, the formula should be =XLOOKUP(A3;$H$2:$H$10;$P$2:$P$10), and then it can be applied to other below cells.",True

@rairaMB,2023-12-08T14:35:12Z,0,"I got this solution to value error from the net;  When using XLOOKUP with multiple rows, the result may be an array of values rather than a single value. If you enter the formula in a single cell, and the result is an array, it will return a #VALUE error. Solution: To handle the array result, you need to enter the formula as an array formula by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing the formula. This will enclose the formula in curly braces {} and allow it to return multiple results. For example, if you want to get the corresponding values from columns O and P for each matched row in column I, you can use the following array formula: =XLOOKUP(A3, I2:I10, O2:O10&P2:P10)    and it worked for me",True

@the_joerne_supremacy,2023-04-01T23:31:05Z,0,"Not sure if someone else commented on this, but when you copy/paste formulas, you have to be sure the various cells AND ranges are still the ones you want to use. Like when you had to change the A3 to an A4, when you were wanting to lookup Pam Beasley in the first example after you pasted the formula from the Toby Flenderson XLOOKUP. If you look at the lookup_array and return_array in the Pam Beasley formula, those ranges shifted down, and I suspect IRL you want to continue letting the lookup and return start from Row 2. This can be solved by using absolute signs ($) in the cell references, but that might be a separate tutorial. Great videos!",True
