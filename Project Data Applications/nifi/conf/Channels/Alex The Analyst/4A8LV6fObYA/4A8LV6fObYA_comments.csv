@Lidijamne,2022-05-14T05:31:33Z,1,"Hey Alex, i am in the process of deciding which one between these two to take: Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (cost 39$ a month) or the The Tableau Data Analytics Certificate (course cost around $3000, it incorporates business analytics implications)? I have a bachelor of science in economics and looking to do a career shift to business and data analytics. I know the first certificate includes the use of R programming language, so i am quite curious as to which one you recommend minding the cost, skills that will be acquired and career and employment prospective. Thank you so much in advance üôè",True
@crazydrifter13,2022-03-19T04:29:48Z,0,They're trying to LOOT us. Maybe its a news for people in the US but education and specially exams should not cost that much.,True
@PatrickBateman12420,2022-03-17T14:11:09Z,1,"I shelled out $750 (at a discount) for the exam prep course. The course offers a mockup exam which is extremely valuable. Using Associate Cert. preparation is NOT enough. For example, an exam question requires us to know the difference between Rank Dense vs. Unique, Initial SQL vs. Custom SQL ... the title sounds cool, but the exam is challenging if you haven't used Tableau Desktop/Prep/Server for a while (I would say years). Long term, I think the same is going to be a requirement. Short term, probably not ... I took the exam on March 4, 2022, and was still one of the first 1,000 (got this early bird thing) which tells me the demand is still low (or many fail?).",True

@joeltochukwu4199,2022-02-27T20:20:27Z,1,Phewww. Thanks for the video @Alex. So many requirements and certifications out there that I'm asking when does it stop which in turn makes me feel like a mediocre.

@williamreyes4188,2022-02-26T00:50:23Z,12,"Hey Alex how are you? I recently found your YouTube channel after taking an interest in data analytics. I‚Äôve seen tons of your videos already and I am grateful for what you do and all the amazing content you put out. I‚Äôve began taking the Google data analytics course and have been taking plenty of notes, and so far I  think it‚Äôs an amazing course for someone who‚Äôs a beginner like me, but that‚Äôs what scares me. I went to college for a technical certificate in automotive. For the last 4 years I‚Äôve been working on cars and making a living in this industry. I‚Äôm currently 22 and I know I have plenty of time to switch careers and do something I‚Äôll love. What scares me the most about jumping ship into data analytics is the fact that my resume may be pretty weak compared to someone coming out of college with a bachelors degree in statistics or data related. I plan on making a portfolio and creating an amazing LinkedIn page once I develop my skills more but looking ahead it scares me at the thought of not being able to find a job in this field and being stuck in my current career. Any words of advise and encouragement?   I know the google certificate alone won‚Äôt get me a job and I plan on taking a few more courses and definitely watching a lot more of your videos as well, but any advise would mean a lot to me thank you!",True
