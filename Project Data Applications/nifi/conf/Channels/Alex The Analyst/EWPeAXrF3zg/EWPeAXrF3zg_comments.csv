@xuanyuliang101,2021-10-21T09:46:17Z,0,"Good evening Alex! Your videos are very helpful to beginners such as me. I tried the last question, the highest salary, with cte like you, did and I also tried subquery but I got a little bit confused about it. select      d.name as Department,     e.Name as Employee,     Salary from Employee e join Department d on e.departmentid=d.id where (e.DepartmentId,salary) in (select DepartmentId,max(salary) from employee group by DepartmentId)  This answer is accepted, but why does it go wrong if ""e."" is added to the ""DepartmentId"", like ""e.DepartmentId""  in the last line? It seems that they don't have too much difference... Looking forward to seeing your reply. Leon Kind Regards",True
