In my opinion, you learn more stuffs working with Startup but you have the stability with big companies. You could add to work in consulting, to go to work in a company but it's your client",True

@dmarcolinok,2020-12-15T11:21:50Z,1,"First of all, broccoli. It sounds nice and it is very similar in Portuguese, my native language: brócolis. Amazing video, Alex. I am just starting my life here in the USA and I was already a Data Analyst in Brazil.  Now that I have authorization to work here, I am applying for jobs as a data analyst too. And man, market here is crazy. Especially during pandemic. Every position that I think I am a good fit, I have more 200 people competing with me. Anyway. I am 28, no kids, live with my husband. I never worked for a startup, but it feels like I am going to learn a lot and that will help me with my path to a big company in the future. I really appreciate your channel and all of your tips.  Now I know what to expect if I get hire by a startup.",True
@veronicab2096,2020-11-13T06:08:20Z,1,"Tell your son your fans like Broccoli, too!  I’m new to Data Analytics. I was lucky enough to find a position in the field. It’s an interesting blend of Fortune 500 job security and training with a the same kind of variety you’d find at a small business. Unfortunately, the pay is like a small business as well.   What skills (beyond the basics - SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel) could I focus on to make myself valuable? What soft skills would be useful?",True

@cesarjr2571,2020-10-20T16:24:32Z,2,"I've worked as an IT Support at a Start-Up company. It wasn't the best, to say the least. What would you say to the employees who are starting fresh at a start-up with how to handle the workload, the fast pace environment, the many hats you might wear, and the stress level? By the way, I love broccoli 🥦I consistently eat it most days along with my chicken and rice",True

I feel super stuck in my current job, but i’m constantly working towards improving my statistics knowledge and also learning sql on udemy,  It’s so difficult right now here in India to get a new job because of the pandemic situation, but I truly hope that in the next few months to come, I’d be able to bag my first job as a data analyst:D   Wish me luck!",True
@hrushikeshthorat1433,2020-10-18T22:18:32Z,2,"Broccoli 🥦 Working with startup is really an advantage to grow your skills! I have a question please.. Since, I am a self paced learner, and if I wanted to complete some projects on Data analytics (real time will be a plus), which website or way you would suggest me to achieve some projects which are recognized by the industries for an Entry level or Associate Data Analyst? It would be really helpful for lot of us. Since, most of the freshers like me are stuck onto this (who are self paced learners), we don't know where to exactly apply our knowledge and most important, very few companies offers a data analyst jobs to freshers with no projects. They need experience, So may be doing industry recognized or real time projects might help us?",True

Currently on contract as a data analyst (tho there isnt much analysis in my work - i'm doing routine procedures and also building and debugging data pipelines) - anyways, on contract at a fortune 100 company and looking at Data Engineering roles there.  Last job was a single-person-with-some -help shop where the stability of the company seemed to fluctuate by the hour.
