@danielegant,2021-08-18T15:25:30Z,0,My last company gave us subscriptions to Coursera (we had to apply). I was able to learn how to code through it which helped me in my then job. My current company gives each manager a training budget so I could take courses as long as they make sense for my job/job prospects within the company.,True
@indexplus,2021-07-27T05:23:01Z,0,"He said learn on employer's time, not dime. Actually, employers love to pay for certificates, they will probably not pay for a degree even if you could attend in the evenings",True
@indexplus,2021-07-27T05:16:59Z,0,"He s right, a typical data analyst will have a business degree and experience in less technical and more business/finance areas.",True
@Jefferson-ly5qe,2021-05-26T12:38:17Z,0,"Hey Alex, very informative video. I'm interested in data science and am currently choosing between online DS master degrees in Australia (coming from a bachelor degree in agribusiness). One is a year longer to complete but seems very thorough. The other is a bit light on for stats and python but is shorter and cheaper. I could use the extra time/money to learn more advanced stats/get online certs/work on GitHub projects. If I'm willing to put in the effort in my own time do you think a weaker degree is likely to prove a drawback? I'm imagining I would start out in analytics either way",True

@geo4design,2021-04-23T16:11:24Z,0,"Hi, I didn't know that employers dont invest on their resource knowledge leverage or fund them to re-skill that is not the case where I work so that amaze me, I can't tell where is it or their social media studio robot will pop the alarm and will look at my other comments as well but if you want to get a certificate is very common to get a voucher and time and if you fail one time they also cover it, so is good to know Im in a good place to start my career shift. Thanks for your videos",True
@aaronharris7975,2021-04-22T18:22:48Z,0,I disagree with employers not paying. If u are at a fortune 500; I've found this is the norm. My first company paid for my entire masters.,True

@sojournerlies3848,2021-04-14T18:08:14Z,0,"It's jarring as a new viewer to hear you harp so much on jobs not paying to upskill their employees as I just watched one of your videos yesterday highlighting tuition reimbursement as a benefit to keep an eye out for when applying. _________ If you're going to position yourself as above drama, then... be above it... You don't actually get points for claiming to be above drama and having no issues with someone, when you actively engage in with what you believe to be drama and spend a whole video being passive aggressive.  This contention definitely feels like a thinly veiled attempt at driving engagement. Which is kind of sad but on brand for 2021 influencer culture.   It was just weird to hear you say you love this guy like a brother and have no issue with him, and then in the very next breath say that he stole a video topic that you had not yet published - with a straight face. It was surprisingly accurate foreshadowing of the next eleven and a half minutes of judging his tabs, his video editing, and... his pull ups...  Not sure if yall see the Google Certificate as something that will significantly expand your niches viewership and are now trying to claim the biggest share of new viewers, but if so, I guarantee you aggy videos like this aren't going to keep viewers coming back. Fix it.",True

@taylorbosier,2021-04-06T15:18:52Z,30,"The poorly defined roles is such a true statement. Some jobs I've looked at turned out to be full software development with minor emphasis on stats. Some data analytics roles turn out to be business intelligence that is meant to look at the flow of data.
