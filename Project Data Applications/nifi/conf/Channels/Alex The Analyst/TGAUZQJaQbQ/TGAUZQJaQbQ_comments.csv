@dougmarkham8576,2024-02-12T22:22:28Z,0,"Weirdly, when dealing with data sets exceeding 300,000 rows,  it's easier to take the data into the VB Editor using variant arrays and write back rows where a column contains a value rather than apply filters.  Unless you're transforming your data within the VB editor or via power-query, Excel doesn't handle large data well. It seems to me that Microsoft intend you to handle large datasets with more advanced tools.  I agree that version control is less than ideal.  Now Excel online and OneDrive are being used to work on the same spreadsheets simultaneously,  I believe Excel can actually do what Google Sheets can do---works for me anyway.  I don't think excel is designed for advanced data visualisation; however,  now they're integrating some Python so who knows what they're planning. Perhaps some kind of AI / Excel integration to help automate data visualisation.   Whilst general programming languages offer perhaps a great variety of things to automate, VB and VBA can automate quite a lot both within excel, in windows,  and other Microsoft products.   The question is why you would learn enough VBA or VB to develop a broader ability to automate. You would do so only if your job required it. I think most people learning to program are going to be aiming at the future jobs markets: AI, machine learning, Data analysis,  website design and virtual reality/film/video gaming applications.   However,  what's noticable is that even very large corporations still heavily utilise excel. Often these companies lock-down their machines so most users can use VBA but not Python. I think that's the main reason VBA programmers haven't abandoned VBA altogether in favour of Python.",True

There are potential workarounds though with tools like powerquery but yes I agree at this point it makes sense to use a different tool or excel combined with some other tools like Python dataframes.  (2) Version control so this is part of google sheets. For excel files if saved in share point or onedrive you can do that.

@bgyw,2023-11-14T13:51:45Z,4,"This is interesting. I'm starting in data analytics and I've had this idea that I should use Excel since it's an industry standard. I used it back in the days (when Google Sheets didn't exist) but eventually switched over Google Sheets because it's free, the interface is much nicer and has plenty to offer for analytics. Trying out Excel now feels like a step back, especially in terms of UI. Maybe you should do a head to head Google Sheets vs Excel video.",True

@MegaTimPim,2023-11-14T13:37:43Z,2,Ppl who really know excel well have wonderful solutions for all of your problems. Except for large data exceeding the Power Query capacity.,True
@bms4654,2023-11-14T13:36:35Z,2,Thank you for saying it. No more cleaning spreadsheets and connecting vlookup....I also roll my eyes when I click a cell and it's a page and a half of logic functions. I hate SharePoint and SharePoint List more than Excel.,True
@sr-xd8jb,2023-11-14T13:28:27Z,2,I usually slice the datasets into multiple csv files and then load them to Excel.,True
@parkermonroe6599,2023-11-14T13:22:09Z,14,Size limits - I agree with for the most part but you can connect to your data with power query and load it to your data model to get around the limitation here most the of the time.  Version control -  you can set up power automate with an automated cloud flow to save a copy of the file in another location at various time intervals and grab the current date when the flow runs.  Collaborating with people - this one I haven't really understood with nearly all of my files being stored either in OneDrive or SharePoint they are cloud files that multiple people can work in at the same time. Only issue I've had with it is some things like pivot tables or power pivot don't like to have auto save enabled but those are typically only features I am using in a file for just me.  Automation - this one is fair. VBA is great and all but definitely not perfect and the random code I've received is really hard to understand what it's doing. I am excited that the Automate tab is in desktop version though because if you can write some typescript or record macros there you can also use power automate to run your macros in the cloud without the workbook being open.,True
@dixonstroi,2023-11-14T13:18:00Z,22,"I still love Excel, but since acquiring more tools my baseline is to do as much outside of Excel (using SQL, Python, Jupiter, cloud tools etc) as possible. I get the notion that Excel is not designed for those heavy duty ETL and aggregation tasks and it's geared towards the end of the analysis process; for working mostly presentation ready tabular data into tables, PivotTables, charts, etc. for quick consumption. It really struggles when you need to do anything relational of any significant size. Also it always bugs out at the least opportune time. Holla if you've had to re-enable PowerPivot multiple times in one day before.",True

@Wreckedballs,2023-11-14T13:10:10Z,2,"I passionately dislike Excel, it is a tool that is often used as a one size fits all solution. It is so engraved into modern business processes that it is only replaced when the tool begins to cost money due to its poor underlying function.  Previously working in admin for a large finance company had the culture of 'edit spreadsheet and pass it on, go to this spreadsheet enter values..  I really did refuse to build on Excel and it allowed me to focus on using more appropriate tools and advance I better tools.",True
