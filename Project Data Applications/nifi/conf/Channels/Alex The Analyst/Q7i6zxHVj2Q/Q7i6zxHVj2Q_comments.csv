Given Postgres's tight integration with mapping using PostGIS, it makes it a no-brainer for any map based database usage.

One huge issue is that Postgres does not allow temporary variables (you'd have to use a function), while TSQL does.  There's a way to do that sort of functionality in Postgres outside of a function, but it's not intuitive, and it's barely written up on the internet, so it took a while to get an optimal solution.  That said, I do like Postgres a bit more - seems a bit more ""pure"".  Postgres also seems to have a lot of datatypes.

But the SQL language is quite standardized (by ISO , IEEE standard or something) and the difference between the SQL dialects is mostly the servers' built-in functions, like string or data values processing and some special language extensions which are using the specific features of each DB-server. For example, the MS SQL server is using the T-SQL (Transact-SQL) programming language extension, but the PostgreSQL is using  the PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostGres Structured Query Language) and the Oracle DB-servers are using the PL/SQL (Programming Language/SQL) extension. The PL-extensions are used for the server-based business logic programming, mostly, for writing stored procedures, user functions, triggers, packages, etc. So, in my opinion, you should compare the SQL language dialect differences, not the PL-extensions and not the IDEs (which is not a property of the SQL language itself).",True

So if you own a company that needs to be sure that no data is lost in case of crash and you choose mysql because it's easier to code/understand, you might get a lot of trouble when you server will crash and part of your data is gone. When it comes to maintenance, there is always a trade off between a system that has great support and a system that has less (paid vs free).  Same comes with community.

T-SQL is just the scripting language, in MySQL its just regular ANSI sql, but in Postgres theres PG/SQL which is heavily influenced by Oracles PL/SQL. Also you mention not being able to show T-SQL which was again not particularly accurate. The easiest way to do that would have been to show that you can declare variables and use them in queries. Again the same applies to Postgres.   the other thing that I found could have been a bit better is how you mentioned the sys objects in SQL server.

@tonyshelver4931,2022-06-01T06:21:07Z,189,"I have used all these, MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL extensively for decades, nearly all in large system / large data applications.  MySQL has been used for small systems.  Also used Oracle quite a bit, especially in the 90s.  Review mostly focuses on the DB front end tool, rather than the DB capabilities, so a very misleading title / blurb to the video. There are multiple DB user tools, other than the standard ones supplied by the DB, including ones that work across multiple database types. The front end is a factor, but should NOT be the driving choice when looking at DB systems, unless you are a rank beginner, or have very simple DB needs.  This review is NOT highlighting how to actually select the right database, as behind the toolset they offer very different capabilities. For example, Postgres has unparalleled support for time series, sharding and geospatial systems.  PostGIS is the most powerful and widely used GIS DB extension / capability available on any DB type.  PostgreSQL is ultra-extensible.  The extension system is designed in from inception, and in addition to sharding, time series, and so on, also provides multiple database programming languages. In addition to pgplsql (the equivalent of MS SQL TransactSQL), you can program in Python, C/C++, and many others via suitable extensions.   The list of extensions to support various capabilities likely runs in the 100s, and includes adding in different indexing and datatype options.  MS SQL:  I used this extensively as well.  The big stand out here for me is Transact SQL.  If you are doing complex, large data set manipulations, or are really locking down the database against misuse via the use of triggers, rules and so on (can do the same in Postgres),  this can be a life saver.  MySQL: their procedure /  procedural support is very young, and nowhere near as robust as MS SQL or Postgres.  MySSQL mostly came out of the embedded / small system / front end developer space, and has grown from there, where both MS SQL and Postgres have large system DB roots. (See ORM mention below)  So, I would say, if you are a beginner / front end developer, who is not going to focus on the DB capability, and has a fairly standard requirements list. look at MariaDB (open source MySQL), but you may want to consider PostgreSQL depending on your target application environment. MS SQL is great, but not open source.  ORM: The other use case for MySQL is if you are using the DB behind an ORM (object relational mapper), where the DB is just a data repository.  Then it really doesn't make a huge difference which DB you select, as they are mostly black boxes.  You should choose the DB that your ORM supports best, and is cheapest to own / operate. Obviously issues such as reliability and performance are important, and here Posgres and MS SQL have decades of experience to show.   In our case,  PostgreSQL was the only choice.  Our application is heavily GIS (Geographical Information System) and time series focused, where we have to analyse 100s of thousands of records for a single transaction to provide the functionality we need.  We also use pgplsql functions heavily for update and extract transactions as we have multiple front ends for the application.   MS SQL was tested but the GIS component proved to just be too slow and not nearly as robust / functional as PostGIS.  MySQL just didn't have the functionality to any useful degree. We could have used Oracle, but the costs were prohibitive....",True

I expect the 4th edtion will have dramatically better PostgreSQL coverage because of the new co-authors Regina Obe and Leo Hsu (authors of ""PostGIS in Action"").

If you are developing a website then MySQL is an obvious choice, it is part of the legendary ""LAMP"" stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack that powers many websites including WordPress (but not Django or Flask which use PostgreSQL). SQL Server does not play nice with MS Acccess (different data types and SQL syntax), but PostgreSQL plays nice with LibreOffice Base.

Taking about a program for how it looked is a little bit useless. To me, a it doesn't matter how pretty is the user interface for your database, the real important thing is the power and robustness behind the engine that keep my data.  Not all databases are suited for all projects. For example, a lightweigth service that requieres a db and is running in a battery powered device (your phone) can't use something like postgresql or mysql embebed in the device, you use sqlite for that. In the other hand, if your software runs in a huge server located in a well powered datacenter, and you must process 500K transactions per second, perhaps is not a good idea to use sqlite. Before I saw your video, I was expecting to see some metrics and plots when you compared the engines in terms of inserts per second, reads per second, etc.  I don't want to be rude in any way with your opinion, I just want to go to a point: You didn't compared the DB engines, you just compared the user interface. All of them are Database servers that programs can connect and work with bypassing the UI and go straigth via a remote client connection  to do the work. UI are for humans and are no longer requiered once you application is up and running.  This is my opinion and in no way must be take away as the truth or the only way of thinking. I would have chamged this video name to: which DB has the best user interface.  I'm not a fan of oracle database, but is one of the most used db server where the data must be secured. Why?

But no, you just confusing RDBMS (Relational Database Management System such as MySQL, SQL Server or Postgres) and its client application (MySql Workbench, SSMS, PGAdmin4 respectively). So the only difference you mentioned between those RDBMSs is their query language. All other differences are really just some UI elements of their default clients.  Anyone watching this, imo, should understand that distinction. You are not bound to single client app. There are many other clients, some of them even can work with several RDBMSs. And some of them are even can affect the query language! SSMS, for example, lets you write GO in the query editor as a delimiter between queries, but there is no GO statement in T-SQL, it's SSMS specific (their official command line client supports that too, I believe) delimiter, which makes your queries run as separate batches instead of one per editor tab. Some other clients give you more convenient features - Forge Studio for MySQL has quite good graphical query constructor. HeidiSQL is just very lightweight, can work with mysql, postgres and sql server, and probably something else, and it has freaking search bar in object explorer pane that even supports some regex magic (looking at you, SSMS, why with all Microsoft's resources there is no f-ing search bar right on top of object explorer??? Why search is buried in context menu and doesn't support regular expressions???). DBeaver is quite powerful and works with several different RDBMSs... That's just some clients that I remember and use or have used in past, there are surely way more of them.  In fact, any application that connects to a database is a client for that database, just not every app lets you write queries yourself and shows results as boring tables. Some let you instead, I don't know, watch a video on your screen and read some comments below, and even write one yourself :)",True
