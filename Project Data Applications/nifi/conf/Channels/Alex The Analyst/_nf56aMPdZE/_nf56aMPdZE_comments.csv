@Anonymity4LDAF,2024-05-04T02:26:51Z,0,Super helpful. Have you done a video showing what data analysis can be done with Chat GPT?,True
@PedroOjeda,2024-04-16T14:55:32Z,0,Generally it is pretty weak,True
@glennvandaele7998,2024-03-30T21:01:12Z,0,20 dollars for this? Thats way overprized. Most people will just use chatgpt and CTRL+C and CTRL+V. In Excel its really really bad as well. Maybe i was expecting too much.,True
@archonjubael,2024-03-30T19:45:29Z,0,"This was too basic for me, but it gives a bit about where to find and maybe leverage copilot.  I might have to finish this later.",True
@TheXtremeLife12,2024-03-27T02:28:54Z,0,"I agree Copilot for excel it‚Äôs not great for data analyst/ data Science types. I just took a copilot  for a test run today and couldn‚Äôt get it to do anything more than some superficial stuff ( I tried to get it to run a simple linear regression on a small dataset of advertising expenditure vs sales data‚Ä¶ which I can get to work using a program like Chat GPT 4)‚Ä¶ copilot failed miserably, basically said you couldn‚Äôt do regressions in excel (which I guess is technically true without data analysis add in enabled).  That said‚Ä¶ I agree it might be useful for people who have no idea how to use excel. The problem with that conclusion‚Ä¶ is that I feel like copilot is an expensive add on and it doesn‚Äôt really seemed to be marketed to that demographic of user. Like all the promotional stuff the last year seemed targeted to more power users. It requires you have a business 365 license‚Ä¶ which I mean most people running that at least have a decent working knowledge of MS Office.  So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I‚Äôll play around with more another week before Rendering a final verdict‚Äî but off the cuff first impression‚Äî I‚Äôm not that impressed with it‚Äî seems more like Mr, Clippy from yesteryear.",True

@michaelyiannatsos6794,2024-03-19T10:49:13Z,0,Thanks Alex! Easy to watch and informative!,True
@jja1941,2024-03-02T13:14:35Z,0,"Just like with Gemini there is a built in bias in responses, such as the response I received to the name of a Brother that taught me in Catholic High School. It preceded the response to the Brother's details with a paragraph of another Brother who 30 years later was found to have kid porn on his computer. Totally irrelevant to the question asked, but obviously part of the anti Catholic algorithm!!",True
@johnbainbridge1931,2024-02-20T13:03:52Z,0,"Thanks Alex for the video, great overview. I run office on 2021, not 360, so I'm guessing users like me also have to factor in this second subscription. I'd say from what you shared for a non-beginner like me probably not worth it. I'm sure this service will get much better (although maybe pricier too) in the months and years ahead though.",True
@youdodat2,2024-02-19T10:46:57Z,6,I‚Äôm not impressed.,True
@MinatoJunior-hl8tb,2024-02-12T18:11:50Z,0,Hey can you show an a video how to download a csv file faster into mysql. The csv file im trying to download is big. Im not able to use excel or the free version since the file is to big for me to fix some stuff on the data.,True
@user-mq9em3sv2u,2024-02-12T17:33:28Z,5,i am farmer and its really hard for me to keep the record of data mostly money like crop costs or lend money from others i thought i could use AI on my mobile inside copilot chat app like just writing add 500 in fertilizer column or add 2000 earning in 2023 wheat or paddy 2023  its a hassle to start my desktop and write one particular thing i could do it on the time sometimes i forget i got money from that guy or gave him this amount of money i am pretty much sure Microsoft can do this and they will improve this in future but they are just scared from people for there privacy breached like people would criticise them for it i would love to get that type of thing with AI and i dont know i can pay 20 dollars but i think AI should be free in future at least it should like google search engine was copilot chat is already free tho so that's good thing  I am not going to pay for copilot until they do this type of improvement,True
@Jim-tv2tk,2024-02-11T22:10:18Z,0,Doesn't work for me on desktop word. Online word Copilot is slow or just stops mid answer. Support sucks. ChatGpt 4 is much better so far.,True
@user-rp2fz7su9d,2024-02-11T16:15:40Z,0,"This is waste of computer space.  Did not give my an useful answers to my questions.  Microsoft installed it without my permission.  From a personal use, use at home, it's absolute garbage.  You're better of using google.  At there you can scroll down the results to get the information you actual need.",True
@dianadennis7225,2024-02-10T18:28:15Z,0,"Been waiting for this. it is expensive, given that it comes on top of the Office 365 subscription and has mediocre functionality. This iteration is def not worth the $; better to learn Excel üòú",True
@christianlawrence159,2024-02-09T16:16:10Z,1,"Seems to me it will only help people who have very limited skills in excel. Changing a data format is much easier to do manually. could do it in the time it took to type the requirement. A product like this surely comes in to its own when you have a ton of data, so it not being able to handle or help with the more complicated areas such as splitting out text in one column is weakness. Again can be done by formula find or using the other built in separation tools. 7/10 for basic users, for more advanced it looks more like a 3/10.  Good video though as totally informative and balanced.",True

@AIJimmyVideo,2024-02-07T00:23:03Z,0,"Wow, thank you Alex for taking the time for the ""unboxing"" and the walkthough video of Copilot in Excel and the other Microsoft apps. I appreciate your assessments of the limitations as well.  Wondering what you think of the comparison of Copilot in Excel vs comparable Gen AI features in Tableau, PowerBI, Cognos, and Hex?",True
