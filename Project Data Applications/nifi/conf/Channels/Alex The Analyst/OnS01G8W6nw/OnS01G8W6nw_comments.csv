@GeorgeRodriguez72,2023-08-20T05:19:27Z,0,"Alex, a comment you made near the end of the livestream got me thinking. You said you used to review resumes but now with all you have going on it just isn't feasible. Have you given any thought to taking all the content you have created over the years and feeding it into a LLM and creating ""Chat Alex the Analyst""? I know OpenAI has probably already ingested all your content but I'm a huge fan of Scott Galloway and he has talked about doing that and building some type of chat service for his listeners. Thanks for the livestream and I hope you had fun on your date.",True
