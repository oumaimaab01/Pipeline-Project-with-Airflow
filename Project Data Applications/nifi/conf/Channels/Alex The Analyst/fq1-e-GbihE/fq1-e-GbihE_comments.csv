@jimbrodeur8711,2024-04-14T01:00:46Z,1,"It took me almost exactly 6 months to the day from when I started learning the skills to when I started in my new job. This was a major midlife career change for me after owning a landscaping business for 15 years. The first company interviewed with offered me the job, so I never even made my portfolio. I'm now 6 months into it and looking for much more technical work. This is proving to be harder then getting my first job.",True

@Recklessness97,2023-09-07T16:41:51Z,7,"The problem is finding a place or company who will hire you. It's tough. Especially with little to no previous experience. I have an Associate degree in Business and the Google Data Analytics Professional Cert. I built a portfolio and GitHub, tailored my resume/cover letter to each job specially and still no luck. I've applied to ten jobs that I meet or exceeded the requirements last month and got no interviews. It's very discouraging and sucks. I feel there's always applicants with more credentials applying to the entry level jobs I am applying to.",True
