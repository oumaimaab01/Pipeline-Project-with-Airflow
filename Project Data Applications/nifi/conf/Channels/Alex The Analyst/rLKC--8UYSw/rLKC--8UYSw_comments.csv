@rafunongrum7085,2023-04-27T12:29:30Z,0,Hi Alex! Really appreciate all the videos you have put up. You are by far the best teacher on here regarding data analytics. I wanted to ask you... For a typical data analyst role how many rounds of interviews are there? I havr heard some companies have case study rounds.. How would you go about them? It would be really useful if you made a video on that. Thanks!,True

@asols4318,2020-05-21T15:38:17Z,6,hey Alex appreciate all the videos they've been quite helpful. I have a question about how much knowledge to have in python. Right now I'd say i'm pretty comfortable with data cleaning and data visualizations. Is there anything else you'd say is necessary or helpful that i can try and learn for a data analyst role? I know SQL is probably the most important skill but just want to be prepared with Python skills as well so i'm not stumped in an interview or anything. Thanks man.,True
