@KANOJIARICHA,2024-05-03T06:50:38Z,0,"This is very nice way to sort all the files in the folder. I modified the program a little, and allowed it to read all files from the folder and generate the folder name based on the file extension. This way we can eliminate the hard code folder names.  I have also used os.path.join() method to join the file paths without using '/' , which is again a good practice when working with files.",True

I am kinda new to programming and I would like to ask for help with two questions if anyone sees this:  1: When defining the if statement for the for loop, I tried to add multiple formats to a given folder like:  if "".jpg"" or .""png"" in file and...( the rest as in the video) but for some reason this made all files and folders copy into the destination directory, which I am not able to understand why?   2: It worked for me in Jupiter, but I first tried to do it in VS code with an Anaconda virtual environment setup, but for some reason shutil couldn't be accessed. OS worked fine. I have worked with different packages before, so I am not sure why this one doesn't like my virtual environment.
