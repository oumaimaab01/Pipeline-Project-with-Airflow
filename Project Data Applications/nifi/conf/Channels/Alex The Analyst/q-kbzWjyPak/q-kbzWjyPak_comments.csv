@newenglandnomad9405,2023-06-28T14:46:27Z,0,"Not related to tthis video but i have a question.  From your video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9URM1_2S0ho  As someone who just started learning sql, I have a point of confusion. I understood your video where you took covid data, arranged certain colums and ordered it, and then made a visual in Tableau. I get that.    My confusion is, when you're doing joins. What are you , or what does your employer, want to learn from that query.  How does salesman by title (15 min 8 sec in video) translate answer any questions?  Or video (13 min 36 sec). In other words, i get the idea of sql queries, where, order by, but what the heck do you do with the results?  My mental disconnect from any sql tutorial is, orders name id salary dept, whatever, how are you using the query results in the office for some kind of report on a daily 9-5 work basis?  I'm confused. Help. Love your channel!   I used what i learned from you and others to take Kpop databases and make visuals for sales and most popular songs. Just trying to understand how query results would be used ""at work"" in real life for some purpose.  Thanks for being patient with my seeminly ignorant or unaware question in relation to work production.",True

@Th3dutch,2023-06-20T23:56:07Z,8,"Hi Alex, thanks for starting a series on webscraping. I am already webscraping for a few months and I think it is a very valuable skill for any Data Analyst.   Creating your own data sets really gave me more appreciation for all the open data sets out there (especially because you start to realise all the hard work that goes into it).  Furthermore you learn more about programming and data structures, which is great!  Just wondering: when talking about covering advanced webscraping in the future do you mean scraping with  Scrapy? I would love to learn more about that, but unfortunately there are not many people that talk about this.",True
