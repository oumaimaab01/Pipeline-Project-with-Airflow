Somewhere in that middle to senior level one probably needs to think about getting some statistics skills, maybe even could be the right masters program for this field. 2.  I am concerned that a lot of the analytics roles that are so plentiful will be eliminated by the development of machine learning and the more advanced technological development of the programs such as BI and Tableau.  The field may end up over the next few years becoming a hybrid of data analytics, data science, data engineering.   4.

Biggest thing I would add is you have only focused on the technical skills here and not the other aspects that come into data analytics. From a technical standpoint I personally do not think there is much of a difference between Mid level and Senior level, slight improvements yes but the biggest technical difference is between junior and mid level.   However from a problem solving there is a big difference. e.g. junior analyst you produce the data which is ask of you, mid level you think more about what they are asking and find ways to add additional value or highlight opportunities you have notices. Senior level you are comfortable going back to a CEO or head of department level figure and asking is this really what you want because half the time they are not asking the question they really want solved.   Final thing I would add is you skill of communicating the data, you may be able to produce the most accurate model but if you cannot communicate the findings it will likely be forgotten.",True

@sergioramos3437,2020-12-17T14:17:30Z,1,Celery is necessary! What else would I eat with my wings ? Every week I watch these I wonder what the larger play is with this channel .. extra source of income? Future main source of income ?  Career boost by becoming a visible authority on the subject matter ? Benevolence? Some combination of the above ? You don't have to answer lol but that question has been gnawing at me,True

@iamaliahmad,2020-12-17T13:20:19Z,1,Great video Alex :) one day I'll be as good as you are at this!,True
@albertkranz6033,2020-12-17T13:04:44Z,0,"Hey  Alex, How does job title matter. Will having a title like Sales Analyst instead of data analyst affect my chances at a mid level data analyst job even if my responsibilities and tools used are the same as a data analyst. I spend a majority of my time in SQL server, Tableau, Excel, occasionally Python.",True
@ViorelClaudiuDascalescu,2020-12-17T12:30:31Z,1,Maybe celery and python work better for you :) https://github.com/celery/celery,True

@adamgdev,2020-12-17T12:14:46Z,2,"As the number 5 like to this video,  I have a burning question.   What is the word on the Google Analytics Cert!?! They were saying  it would be released end of the year and we are getting darn close.  Do you have any updates because I am over here pacing and stress eating waiting for this thing to go live.  The struggle is real!!  Any info would be great!  Also, do you know if there is an early sign up for it or anything like that?  I am super down to collab on this and keep you up to date with  the process when I take the course.  Cheers, keep killing it!  üí™üèΩüêÇ",True
@teddybagadonuts2617,2020-12-17T02:14:56Z,1,"I'm with you that celery doesn't have much flavor to it (it's basically crunchy water), but a few sticks after some super spicy wings can't be beaten!  I really think that this topic is one that a TON of people were looking for clarity on. Thanks for making another killer video!",True
@CunningCaracal,2020-12-17T00:22:20Z,18,"At 30k subscribers you'll have to eat a whole bag of celery. You can't escape this fate, Alex.",True
