No matter what I do, there just seems to be huge issues with the data types. I don't if it's me or what. I initially had trouble converting the excel or to get the excel to import. I gave up on that so went with csv. But then I had to constantly cast the data types differently. Very annoying. So I read a bit more and figured I could save the excel as 97-2003 version. HOWEVER for no reason that I can discern the total deaths and total new cases columns were NULL. There were no values whatsoever. I do not know why. I do now know how to resolve this. I've asked and googled and agonised for at least a week and I'm just giving up.

As many I didn't have a background in IT and wanted to make a career change from Marketing to IT. Before finding your excellent videos I have been struggling getting my foot between the door of many companies who offer a junior Data Analyst position.   Nowadays I am Power Bi Consultant at a medium sized company for 3 months and I am loving every day of my live. Your videos really helped me giving the courage to continue and finally getting the job I have been dreaming of for the last year.   For those who read this I can say that Alex's courses are really the only thing you need to get a Junior Data Analyst job. You might think you are not qualified enough yet to be a Data Analyst but trust me I still have this feeling but the real learning happens on the job. Don't be afraid, just do what Alex tell you to do: follow the SQL and Power Bi course, do a couple of projects YOU are interested about and apply, apply and apply for all the job offers you can find. Trust in yourself that you can be a Data Analyst and it will happen, don't give up. Good Luck !",True

Though it's limited to 65K rows... no thanks  The CSV method works fine *[ Tasks > Import Flat File... ]* to import the CSV file of the same dataset. The only downside is that I had to assign data types to each column and allow for NULL values by manually checking boxes. So that's tedious but the upside there is that you get a pretty good understanding of each row's data type before you are allowed to import the data (unless your import Wizard chooses the correct data types, mine did not). I was using an EXPRESS version of the software. I don't care to know about the differences, I just want it to work.  In any case i will make sure to have all data in CSV format whenever I need to import data.   Additionally, in specifying data types I chose integer for [total_cases] & [total_deaths] which led to the initial query after importing the data to produce a column that truncates cells where the division of 2 integer data types results in a fractional value...   I'm glad I learned how to use Python and SQL through that.",True

On my side, I had to work through technology issues related to running an SQL product on my M1 MacBook Pro.  Not as straight forward as one might hope.  I discovered (AGAIN) that trying to run MSSQLSVR on a Parallels VM just never quite worked right.  I could load various versions, then something just would behave - DOH!  Then, I went back to PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4.  Everything worked okay until a recent pgAdmin 4 upgrade started crashing.  DOH!  After this, I went back to my tried and true Docker/Azure Data Studio tools.  I was able to do everything in your video with a few minor tweaks here and there.  For example, (in my experience) Azure Data Studio won't import an Excel doc like your SQLSVR did, so I imported everything as CSV flat files and got to do WAY more CAST-ing than in your video!  I suppose my most important takeaway is that one should either buy the right computer OR pick one RDBMS and stick with it.  Too many squirrels can  be a HUGE distraction.

@vanct02,2023-05-19T13:47:16Z,0,"From what I have followed so far, if you do this project in 2023, be careful of some queries. First thing I noticed is that the total_cases is cumulative and it only increases. This means it does not accurately reflect the current number of covid cases for the country and if you do a simple division of total_cases/population, this does not reflect the infected rate. Some countries will give you 50%-70% infected rate, which is crazy, and it is totally wrong if you interpreted it as 50% of the population got COVID. So watch with caution. At this point I think this project has become far less relevant.",True

Error or anything similar with ""Divide by zero error"" the reason for this is because your denominator is 0. To prevent this from happening you need to alter the script Alex has provided:  SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/NULLIF(total_cases, 0)*100) AS Death_Percentage FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths  The NULLIF script is as follows:  NULLIF(expression1, expression2)  Two expressions are required in a NULLIF() function. The function checks to see if both expressions are the same. If they are, then the result will equal null. An example is NULLIF('Hello', 'Hello') will result in ""NULL"" because Hello and Hello are the same, but if they differ it will return the first expression (i.e. NULLIF('Hello', 'world') will return ""Hello"" once executed because Hello does not equal world). In this case NULLIF(total_cases, 0), if your total cases equal zero, it will result in a null and will null out your Death_Percentage equation because you cannot divide by 0. If your denominator is NOT 0 and it is a value it will use the total_cases value and complete the percentage equation to give you the Death_Percentage.",True

I got one error about ""provider is not registered on the local machine"" and another that said ""The system cannot find the file specified.""

While in Python you would have to create a different column by dividing those two, then you can check the data with some code:  df['DeathPercentage'] = df[""Total_cases""] / df[""population""] df[ [""a"" , ""b"" , ""c"" , ""DeathPercentage"" ]].loc[ df.b== ""United States""]  PD: I don't how how would I change     """""" df.b== ""United States """""" that part to make it search for STRIGNS THAT CONTAIN the WORD STATES tho.   WHILE IN MIN 37:43 It seems harder to do so. I struggled a lil bit to find a solution, tho the code below do HALF the work, dunno how to handle the IS NOT NULL more than dumping nulls. (Cant find a way to pd.notnull() to help me) unless I use it before to crate another DF.  df[[""b"",""DeathPercentage""]].groupby('b').max()     My point is... under your experience, which one do you recommend the most and which one do you think an employer would take more into consideration, SQL or DATAWRANGLING in PYTHON? And which one of those are more used IRL",True

@heimburgchr22,2022-09-22T01:20:21Z,3,Can't thank you enough for this content!!   Small note at 48:38  - I believe SUM(new_cases) and SUM(new_deaths) will be the same as new_cases/new_deaths (won't reflect the true totals) because you are grouping by date. I think it may be more accurate to use MAX(total_cases) and MAX(total_deaths) given that the values are compounded each day and will never decrease. Would love to hear your thoughts/feedback.

One thing in this video that I cannot figure out myself is that, around 46:00 when calculating the global cases over time, you used SUM(new_cases) and added them up to get total cases. I think it works for the first day when the very first new cases are detected, but after that, every country’s daily new cases can only be added up to get global daily new cases, but not global daily total cases. I think it can work in a window function as moving total, but not in this regular aggregation function.

I am trying to figure out how to SELECT & GROUP BY continent instead so that when I get to the part were we put it into Tableau, everything can be correct.  Alex's query is pulling the MAX of the whole continent instead of each individual country. My theory is that to break it down by continent, the function would involve some nested queries with aggregate functions to first find the MAX of each individual country, then add, or find the SUM, by continent (not even sure if that's possible).    SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!

I can't wait to see what else we are going to learn!  At 33 minutes we just hit the snag of having incorrect types for number fields, which I ran into a lot with importing data files. The issue is that import wizards only check the first few lines of data, and usually if they don't find any data they just assign a ""catch-all"" data type like VARCHAR. To help the wizards know what to do I either a) move a line up to the first line that has representative data in every field , b) re-sort the data so that this occurs, or c) add a dummy first line of data that I can then delete after import. Since these files were sorted by date and had a ton of blanks, I opted for dummy data and it worked great.",True

I did listen to it as i made a meal but i plan to work along side it later especially when i get a new laptop(thanks for that video also btw). Anyway i am curious about this data.   As a data analyst would you ever question the data? Like for example the covid data. To get the death rate percentage it is the deaths divided by how many have tested positive for covid. My concern is that covid spreads faster than we can test people..so that number will undoubtedly be higher which would inturn make the death rate lower. Im curious what your thoughts are on this and if questioning the data is part of the role of a data analyst or frowned upon etc.  Cheers.,True
