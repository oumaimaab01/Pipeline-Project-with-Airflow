@scstudios8,2024-05-23T03:24:47Z,0,"I find people do NOT want to drill down.  They rather want a tab at each level where they have filters they can set that vary by level.  When I do drill down, people always say, can you just make that level as a tab where I can have controls at that level.  Total, sub total, then sub sub total, it always seems better than drilling into the different levels.  The key is, the filters change at the lower levels and you simply gain more filters.  This seems to be WAY more intuitive and I never get requests for drill when people see the levels on tabs.  If the records are not massive, I can have the last tab be full detail so people can do anything on their own in some other tool with the raw data.",True

@the_Brus,2024-03-02T09:02:44Z,0,Nice but shallow. I would like to see more complex things. Like grid with few aggregations (eg. 3 cols) and drill down to show all unique details under it (eg. 10 cols).,True

@nimrod4463,2023-07-09T15:26:03Z,34,"For those who have the updated PowerBI version here is what you need to do in order to see the visualization in the order that is shown in this video: Go to the three dots on the frame of the visualization -> Price -> Sort Descending and unmark the Sort Legend. Now it is ordered correctly. On why it writes ""Sum of Price"", it's probably because of an Update for PowerBI Desktop Version, For that you can just rename it :""Price"" on the field itself. It has the same data.",True
@frybait0626,2023-07-09T11:22:45Z,0,"Can drill down be applied to other tables?
