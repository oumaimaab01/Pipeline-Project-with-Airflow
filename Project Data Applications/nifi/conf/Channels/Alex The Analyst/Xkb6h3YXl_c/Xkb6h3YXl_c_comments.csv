@MindyBrockdesigns,2023-09-13T16:59:14Z,1,"I'm currently working on my MBA capstone project as part of my journey towards completing my MBA in data analytics. Transitioning from a background in IT and marketing, this degree has significantly aided me in securing a technical data analyst position, where I utilize SQL and Python regularly. However, due to the accelerated nature of the program, I've noticed that my soft skills, particularly in effective communication and presentation, could use improvement. I'm seeking suggestions on how to enhance my ability to communicate and present complex data analytics, statistics, AI, and ML concepts to both my team and business leaders. Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated.",True
@NDE-SDJ,2023-09-12T20:23:00Z,5,"I absolutely agree that it is possible to develop your soft skills. If you feel insecure because you are an introvert and have some degree of social anxiety, I promise over the years that you will develop your own communication style and eventually you will learn that people will genuinely like you for who you are. It takes time, and not everyone will like you no matter what you do. But you will become comfortable with who you are. And maybe one day you will own it and create an entire brand around it.

@wilsonman8661,2023-09-07T03:46:45Z,1,Is this job more hard skills or soft skills?  Yes. :D,True
@fallabeaufaebelle,2023-09-06T02:24:04Z,1,"Your hard skills get your foot in the door. Your soft skills determine if that's the right room for you to be in.   When members of my family have hired people, they've told me that there's this bare minimum requirement of being able to do the job they're being hired for that gets your resume on a pile. But what gets you the job is what you bring beyond that. From there, it can depend on a lot of factors. My grandfather preferred in most instances to hire someone who was moldable so if they didn't have a lot of experience or got the basics but nothing specialized then as long as they were someone he wanted to work with then he preferred to teach them how things worked because he had a specific flow. People too set in their own ways clashed in the workplace.   It's not the ""best"" or the ""worst"" way to hire someone. It's simply how things worked for that newsprint company. You might be qualified for several different job openings, but only a handful are a good fit for you and the company because of all the things you're looking for as an employee and what they are looking for in an employee.   In general what I hear from employers is that being able to do the job is literally the bare minimum and if you want the job you have to bring something to the table they actually need outside of what the other folks can do because all the other applicants that are competition with you are also technically qualified for the job too.   Some great feedback I've gotten from my mentor (for those job hunting) is once you get in an interview to ask for feedback from the interviewer on how you can improve. They might be honest and tell you that you're hard skills are great and you'd be great for maybe another position but for a specific reason not what they're looking for in this role. Which is great because you can still keep your name in the hat if that before mentioned position does open up so long as you can establish a good connection. Interviewing and following up can help a lot with networking. Even if it doesn't get you that job you were going for, it can open doors to other opportunities! People talk and someone might suggest you look into applying somewhere else for a role they think you'd fit into and then tell their good buddy there to expect you since they thought you were such a great candidate even if you weren't the best fit for the role you originally were going out for!",True
