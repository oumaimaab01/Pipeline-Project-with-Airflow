Thank you guys for making another video together :) I am going through two major life changes, attempting to change my career & ending a relationship of 5 years.

@eimienwanlanibhagui4859,2021-06-04T13:13:56Z,0,"Thank you Mr. & Mrs. Alex The Analyst. For those of us who are family-oriented i.e. married with toddlers, this episode is/was really relatable. My own sugar is a graduate student and I am seriously thinking of pivoting to DA/DS. I have a very strong quant background - BS Physics with heavy Maths, you know Maths is the language of Physicists and MS Geoscience with GIS and Hydrological Science/Water Resources). But my path has taken me to an industry where I do not think my research-oriented and analysis/analytic persona is being utilized maximally. I got into the field in question after trying to get a job, unsuccessfully thus far, in my MS field. I have invested time and energy in GIS Analysis (analysis of geographical data - wanna do a video on that kind of dataset 🙂?). DA seems to be what I have been doing for long but without using the fancy, industry-needed tools such as Python, R, PowerBI, or Tableau to mention a few.  That said, @Alex The Analyst, your recent post on LinkedIn wrt getting a DA job requiring 30% technical skills and 70% perseverance is ....(do not know what to say).  As a person who pivoted and has been in the data industry as a recruiter and practitioner, what would you advise/suggest to (I love blunt feedback) someone who is strongly considering pivoting into DA or DS at almost 4 decades old?  By the way, you have a beautiful and I believe supportive wife. And your beard is brown in my humble opinion😜.  Let me now go and look for Episode 1 with your wife...",True

I am a product manager in hardware field, but I have an undergrad degree in biotech and I really want to return to this field (as data analyst hopefully) ! I have been saving money for this, but I am still very nervous from time to time about this big decision I made... This episode helped me a lot, so thank you!
