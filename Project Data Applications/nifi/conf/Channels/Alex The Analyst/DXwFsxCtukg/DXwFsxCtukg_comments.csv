@alexanderanikin2551,2023-02-10T11:09:13Z,0,"Hello Everybody. I don't recommend 'Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization'. I finished 3 first courses of this specialization and, to be honest, it is poorly planned; the second course does not correspond with the first, some topics (such as PARTITION, AND-WHERE inside subquery, etc.) are not discussed at all, and Mode Analytics frequently stops operating due to its 10Mb limit, and creating a notebook there is a pain. In the last course (capstone project), they discuss how to prepare data for analysis using python which wasn't covered in the course, and it wasn't a prerequisite. Moreover, they proposed to use tar.gz file in Databricks environment without explaining how to unpack it there (by the way, there is 1.6Tb json file inside). Finally, I dropped it and cancelled my specialization after completing 3 first courses. Let's have a look at how the UC Devis teaches Tableau. As for SQL, they definitely failed.",True

@pedrinchipedrinchi07,2023-01-10T16:06:29Z,2,"Hi Alex, Happy New Year and thanks for the recommendations. However in my experience, the sql for data science course and specialization are poor choices, especially for someone starting out in sql. Here are my impressions per course: 1. The first course is very basic and not at all interactive, it does not go deep into sql and is a continuous reading of slides. Better information can be found on Youtube or the internet. 2. The second course has very good intentions, but the pedagogy and development is terrible. It shows a good use of sql, but leaves much to be desired. Read the user reviews and you will understand. 3. Good course, it delves more into the use of databricks than Sql. 4. The final project is a clown, they recycle material from the other courses and the project does not focus on the use of sql for data science, not even on the use with python, it is them demonstrating that they can perform text extraction and analysis from Twitter.  Honestly I finished the specialization to get the certificate, but not because it will bring me too much value or knowledge, thank goodness I had already done other courses and at work I had had enough experience with Sql. I recommend you not to waste your time in this one and look for better options, the ones I did were all in Spanish.  I hope my review helps you, I wish you a successful learning.",True

@armchairstatistician1556,2023-01-10T15:06:35Z,5,"Unfortunately, with the Google Data Analytics certificate their data is not up to date. I ran into major issues, as a beginner, trying to work with BigQuery which has gone through several updates and did not match up with the curriculum. There were many complaints on the forums but no feedback from Google. Because this segment was so critical to learn I opted to stop the certification track and go another route in my education.",True
@sachi20ful,2023-01-10T14:28:53Z,2,"Thanks for the suggestions, Alex. Although I curated a path for myself after I finished the Google Data Analytics Certification in September last year. I took the following courses: 1. The Complete MySQL Bootcamp by Colt Steele - Udemy 2. The Complete Tableau Bootcamp for Data Visualization by Rayan Slim - Udemy 3. Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R by Jose Portilla - Udemy 4. 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu - Udemy  I'm also doing a Financial Analyst course by 365 Careers at present as I want to build a career in the BFSI industry.  I find Coursera courses pricey and they lack projects that I'd like to feature in my portfolio. Btw I'm using your 'SQL project portfolio' video to add a SQL project to my portfolio.  Also, would you like to connect with me on LinkedIn? Thanks.",True

@biancaportela3978,2023-01-10T13:44:29Z,4,"I've been going this learning data analysis journey for some time and I'm happy too see I've been doing some of the same courses! I did the Google Analytics Certification and yes, it's not very deep. The UC Davis SQL certification it's very nice, the first course made me way more confident with SQL, but the course 2... Very messy. I'm doing the course 3 now, and I'm liking it.   About the python portion, I did the course 1 and 2 of the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization and it was probably the best 2 courses I've taken in a long time. It's so hard that at the end of it you feel like you are ready to deal with most data needed to be a junior data analyst.",True
@DontaJones,2023-01-10T13:39:34Z,11,Thanks Alex for the videos. You helped me see a clear path of how to get where I need to go. I took the Google Analytics Certification and have been an Analyst for 8 months now.,True

@bitsofdataio,2023-01-10T12:43:58Z,4,I'm interested in data analytics but I don't really like the presentation aspect where you have to explain your data analysis to the stakeholders.  I'm a bit of an introvert,True
