@met_0133,2024-03-16T19:57:27Z,0,"Hey Alex, Love your videos by the way. They've helped me tremendously with my first data analysis projects. Quick question: If I already have Python installed on my system, should I remove it before installing Anaconda? I've read mixed reviews as to whether it's recommended or not. I'm just worried about running into errors since I have Python already installed and it is in my PATH variables. But also, would it be best practice anyway to save on storage by uninstalling the original Python before installing Anaconda?   Thanks for taking the time to read this! I look forward to your response!",True

Your tutorials and insights inspired me to learn more and upgrade my skills in this field.  Since then, I have been dedicated to improving my knowledge and have pursued various opportunities to work as a data analyst. Recently, I was fortunate enough to secure an internship in France where I will be analyzing environmental data. This opportunity has been made possible because of the foundation of knowledge that you helped me build.  I cannot thank you enough for the impact you have had on my career. Your dedication to sharing your knowledge and experience has had a ripple effect on my life, and I am sure on many others as well.
