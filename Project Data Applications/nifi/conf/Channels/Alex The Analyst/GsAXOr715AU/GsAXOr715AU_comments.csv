I followed your channel religiously and your interview tips really helped me to ace the interview. The best advice you gave was to start doing projects instead of taking class after class because I was one of those people who was focused more on taking class than to practice my skills. After watching that video of yours I started working on my projects instead. I am really grateful to you. Thank you for being part of my journey and for guiding so many people like me. I look forward to learning more from your channel.",True
