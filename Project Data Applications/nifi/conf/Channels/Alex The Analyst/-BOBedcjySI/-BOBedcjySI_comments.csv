@shivsharma9153,2022-11-15T20:43:56Z,0,"Hi sorry for digressing a bit   I am currently analysing an employees layoff dataset available on¬†kaggle. It has 1574 records and 9 columns, one of the columns name ""Total_laid_off"" (how many employees were laid off from the organisation,datatype: Int), it has 442 records with missing values. what should I do in this case to treat the missing values? should I replace them with median value or shall I drop missing values from the dataset? I have a similar question for another column name ""percentage of employees laid off"" (percentage of employees fired out of the total workforce). in this case, also shall I replace 552 missing values with the median percentage value? What could be the best course of action? I personally thought I should replace the missing values with median values because dropping so many rows would result in a good amount of loss of information.",True
