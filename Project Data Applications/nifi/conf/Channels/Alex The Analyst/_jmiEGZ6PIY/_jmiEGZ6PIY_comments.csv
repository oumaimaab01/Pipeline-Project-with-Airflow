Each day has a value of 1.   Jan 1, 1900 = 1.  11/22/63 = 23337.  I watched this video on 45202.  Times during the day are portions of one expressed as a decimal.  6:00 am is 0.25.  Noon is 0.5.  The 1899 start date was chosen so that excel could recognize and work with any date in the 20th century.  Unfortunately, negative numbers are considered out of range and generate an error message, so Excel cannot work with dates before 1/1/1900.  Cheers! Love the videos!",True
