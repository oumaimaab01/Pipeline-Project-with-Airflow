@domino_2396,2022-08-22T02:11:59Z,0,"Onion, and Mr Alex Bond, I just started with my data analyst career, your content and your tutorials help me a lot. I discovered partial over in your tutorials, and it's one of the functions I recently used in my new job that I truly feel like I'm an analyst now. (I'm self taught so I know a lot in your advanced sql, then know only a few in the intermediate ones)   your content helped me prepare me on what I should expect on this field, and frankly, I wish I found this channel while I was looking for jobs, but for a career shift, my current company is already good.   A friend asked me to be a guest speaker for their young professionals forum to teach stuff about excel. I'd probably go through your videos for pointers. I'm also eagerly waiting for your power bi and python videos. thank you for the content. Glad to be part of the 300, or 30",True

You will be making more money but if you work all the time what are you gonna spend that money on.

Making positive changes isn't about cutting things out; you have to actually replace that time with valuable efforts. If you don't intentionally fill that newfound gap in your schedule, you will inevitably fall back to old habits. You can't just quit old habits; you have to create new ones to take their place.
