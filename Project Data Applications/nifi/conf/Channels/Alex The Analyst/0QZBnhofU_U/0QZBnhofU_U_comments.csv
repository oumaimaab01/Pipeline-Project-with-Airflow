@ronbaron4849,2024-05-08T22:08:40Z,0,"Hi Alex,  I watched this and it really helped, but then I found Springboard data analytics bootcamp and it is pretty comparable to CF, except it also includes Power BI though seems less focused on Python.

@joyfuljaj,2023-01-29T05:17:47Z,0,"Thank you for the review. I'm doing the free course right now and searched for reviews to make sure I wasn't getting into something that was useless. The only other time I had looked into a bootcamp I was disheartened at the price. I am thankful the introductory course is available foran easy price because it will take more than the free part for me to decide to shell out several thousand dollars for this.  I am dipping my toe into finding another career and data analytics keeps coming up.  Unfortunately, based on a brief search locally, I don't think I will be able to replace my current income but I figure pursuing the skills will still be fruitful.  I was wondering how much prior knowledge of SQL, python, or other languages might I need?",True

@gsabella4,2022-08-16T20:27:42Z,1,"The stipulations of the money back guarantee are a bit sketchy IMHO. They can find you a job paying $40k, extremely underpaid, and if you decline - boom there goes your money back perk",True
@djb6496,2022-08-16T19:23:10Z,6,"Meh, I'm just not convinced. It just seems like an expensive super-google data analytics course. I don't see how well this course will prepare anyone for building portfolio projects and that type of experience is what we need to show potential employers since many of us will not have experience or background as a data analyst. This just feels like  a ""teach yourself"" bootcamp service. Everything I have seen can be learned online for free in under a year as well if one were so inclined.",True
@saywhut6096,2022-08-16T18:40:37Z,6,"I don't know what to say about the job guarantee... It says on their site that if you are offered work that is at least 15 hours a week, that it qualifies as a job offer.  Essentially part time with little hours.  I feel like people that take those kind of offers just won't be valued as much by their companies.   Also, since it's 15 hours does that also include freelance and contractor work.  Data analytics is such a broad term that I wonder if the guarantee actually covers real data analysis positions.",True
@rachel_aLOiVEr,2022-08-16T16:53:37Z,5,Happy to see this after seeing your other thoughts on bootcamps... I'm partway through acheivement 3 in the data immersion course with CareerFoundry. So far so good!,True
