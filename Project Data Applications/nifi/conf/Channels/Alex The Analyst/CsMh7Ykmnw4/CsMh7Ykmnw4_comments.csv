With the sheer amount of poverty, unemployment, cost of living and living in a world where oppprtunity is so bs you should 100% lie to these greedy high expectation applications! No one in this day and age has the credentials these companies want. I been hired and interviewed about jobs all the time and tell me these requirements are just ""technicality"". Everything these days are in serious demand and because of these compqny boomer mentalities they can't train the actual position on the job or help wprk for and pay for the training, degree or certification everyone struggles! So ya definitely apply regardless because they have no idea.of the struggle. I gotten jobs all the time and lied on them to filler their interests. You have too! World dors not give a fuq anymore and if they do the worse they can do is not accept your application and continue to struggle trying to find someone to fill their void.

@LazarusStirs,2022-06-03T20:20:19Z,2,"Saying not to lie on a resume, or not too grossly exaggerate, is absurd, when the rules of the game as established by employers themselves, require that you lie. In case anyone hasn't noticed, entry level jobs no longer exist. By that I mean every job listed as entry-level now requires 2 + years of experience. In effect, what this means is what I previously said, entry level jobs no longer exist. Thus, unless you fabricate something very cleverly, or exaggerated to the ultimate degree, how does one without the requisite experience gain employment? Employers have no right to expect a hundred percent veracity from prospective employees when the rules of the game as established by the employers themselves demand that you not be truthful in order to gain employment. Bottom line is, if you tell people to lie to you, don't be surprised or angered when they do.",True

That is what happens when you have multiple people applying for the same position, so I can get where they are coming from, but it means as an employee you do what you have to do to get noticed.   I have been stuck in a career change due to it being a career change and me lacking experience even though I have an advanced degree in the topic. It‚Äôs been very difficult for me to find jobs to get experience in order to have the experience to get the job. And I can‚Äôt do an unpaid internship with three other people depending on me.

@JustAnOrdinarySimmer,2021-02-25T17:43:54Z,18,"You should lie on your CV (UK) = at the end of the day, when someone is finally given the job - depending what it is but a lot of times what they want you to say at an interview can be completely different to what they want you to do on the job. For example, on the interview the employer would say things like ""we are here for you when you have tough family matters"" ""safety is everything"" ""respect is everything"" ""equality is everything"" etc etc you get the point. You get the job, arrive at the place, explain to everyone you're new and within minutes a hand ful of those employees have gone against what you was told on the interview/application. Apprentices for example - some of them go through a tough process to get the apprentice, and when they are on the job, they are treat like piece of shit on a shoe, being victimised by ""initiation pranks"" and just being the mental and physical punch bag for all the other workers. So why can't we lie on CVs when most advertised jobs are also based off lies? What's worse than your colleagues treating you like a retarded puppy at your new job? your actual bosses and supervisors getting in on the joke too!.  So for those reasons - I would say ""go ahead"" to anyone wanting to put on the odd lie on their CV.. unless it's for a career sort of job like becoming a doctor, cop etc..because then you are completely screwed. But applying for a job at some factory or whatever..go ahead and lie to get you that place.. chances are.. most did in the first place.",True
@anthonymartinez6875,2021-02-05T07:38:53Z,5,"I say lie on your resume.  Unfortunately hiring managers love to play these gatekeeper roles, and they do a fantastic job at it. In fact, they do such a good job at it that the United States, who used to be the epicenter of manufactured goods, is now reduced to a ‚Äúconsumer‚Äôs market‚Äù with its World Reserve status on the rocks. See, lying is something they had to do themselves to get where they are today...but then those same people expect their prospects to be honest??  As far as reputation goes, if they try to ruin your reputation, if anything it sheds a light on their character that they don‚Äôt want shining on them, and it may even introduce lawsuits. Personally, in the industry I represent (IT), I haven‚Äôt heard of an employee getting ousted for lying on a resume, and they have no business doing so. The best case scenario of just getting fired is actually the common method of handling a liar (at least in the industry I‚Äôm in).  Now when it comes to something where human lives are involved such as driving a plane or surgeries, I agree you shouldn‚Äôt lie during those times. Any other case, I say go for it. Once again, they can lie to you in your face, and yet they expect honesty from you?? They can lie to you about compensation, actual responsibilities, your benefits, your hours, and potential for career advancement within the organization. They can even lie to you about your longevity within that organization. I‚Äôve seen personal horror stories where people get let go after sinking years into a particular company simply because their services were ‚Äúno longer needed‚Äù. No justification. No closure. I‚Äôve even seen people complete a project, and get laid off immediately after without disclosing that the position was temporary.  TL;DR Lie.
