@mwredfern,2024-04-25T19:25:19Z,1,"I am a data scientist who came over from the data engineering side. SQL is my first language. And the reason is that when you get into the corporate environment and out of the small business (start up), the corps data is stored on oracle databases. Oracle is still the top dog. Also, a lot of the ETL is adhoc to serve a very specific customer and analysis. And the majority of you customers are going to use your data with windows apps. Like powerbi and sql server. And now you have TSQL. And because Microsoft knows most data is stored on oracle servers, the quickest way to get data from Oracle to a SQL server is SSIS jobs, using attunity connectors. üòä   So you really have to know PLSQL. Period. Even if your first language was Python.   Honestly, I use Python to code in front of  the directors and VP‚Äôs. And to build ML pipelines. VP‚Äôs get grins from ear to ear when you code in front of them, showing them some quick analytics and graphs. And you can‚Äôt built ML without Python. Simple.   I hope this helps with a bit more understanding. üòä",True
