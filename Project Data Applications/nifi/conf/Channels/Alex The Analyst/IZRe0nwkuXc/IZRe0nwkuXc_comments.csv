@katherinegarciacruz370,2022-03-23T15:04:06Z,4,It was very refreshing to hear that a data Analyst not necessarily needs to become a data scientist. I share the same feeling more towards data engineering and with this video I have realized that I am not crazy for thinking about it hahaha,True
@timbatman1958,2022-02-13T01:54:20Z,3,I am currently a data analyst in a data science department. Personally I enjoy putting data together to tell a story more than building predictive models. I've never felt the need to jump into being an official data scientist,True

@bl8413,2021-04-19T16:20:51Z,1,"Hey Alex, bit of a longer question here with some background information if you have the time:  So I am a PhD student in a social science field that stresses quantitative research. Essentially, what this means for me is that we utilize software such as R and STATA heavily, deal with large data sets/merging numerous data sets together, running various regression models, interpreting regression outputs, and running diagnostics on these regressions and engaging in data transformation to resolve any errors in the regression models. (Along with data visualization of descriptive statistics and regression outputs).   With all of that being said, my excursions on job hunting websites have led me to so many data analyst positions where it appears that none of the things I practice in academia are advertised as required skills in these respective data analyst positions. Am I simply looking for the wrong type of job? Do different types of data analysts do different things? Is there a uniform set of skills, as opposed to programs you need to know (such as SQL being a must), that practically all data analysts are required to know?",True

@harisjaved1379,2021-04-17T17:34:42Z,13,"The thing is that data analyst and data scientist are very different things. I was a data scientist for 3 years, our department got consolidated and I was let go. Due to extremely high work requirements for a data scientist I actually was looking at a data analyst role and quickly learned that I have never built KPIs, SSRS reports, and very basic forecasting. In one of my interviews I was given a task to do some simple EDA on a medical dataset. When I was done with the task, I actually built a pretty solid XGboost / Classification Models in Python ##(I know python, R, MATLAB, SQL and have written my own packages, cleanup functions) ## including the requested data cleanup EDA. In presenting my findings the manager and her team were more confused with my analysis than anything else. Needless to say I learned that you can‚Äôt go from data scientist to data analyst. Recently I got hired back as a data scientist with a different company.",True

@osito9810,2021-04-16T15:28:33Z,0,"Hi Alex, when you say "" if you have 2 years experience of Data Analyst, you should know a lot"", I think in depends where you did it, for example, I started my 2 first experiences working with SAS Software, It was not SQL, I needed after to learn sql, python etc  One other stuff, I have a computer science degree, and sometimes I think It was not necessary to do 5 years to do this job, because It was a lot of Math, but really who really cares in Company, It's better to be good in programmation and communication to do this job",True

I had some questions as well, wanted to clarify some thing. 1) Do you recommend learning T-SQL or PL/SQL as well?  2) What type of datasets to use for a project as a beginner? From a simple dataset to a more intermediate level. 3) How to make sense of data, to spot trends, facts, relationship between them and make inferences? It would be great if you can do a project series. 4) I've been toying with the idea of freelancing. So, if I get a project, how do I go about asking client the questions? Like, what are they looking for or just how do I communicate with them? I have no work experience and honestly this part terrifies me a bit.  5) Suppose a project is at it's end, we have made a report/dashboard. What comes after this?
