My question is about the 'working conditions' in the US in the tech branch:  In Germany with a B.Sc. you start with a salary of 40-50k in Data Science(25-30k after tax and social security). You also get around 30 days of paid vacation. And sick days are also paid (if they are rare).  How are the conditions in the US especially in the tech branch in comparison?,True
