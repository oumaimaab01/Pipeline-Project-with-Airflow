@NDE-SDJ,2023-11-03T20:41:04Z,1,"Excel has been a staple in my work in finance and accounting and is still so in data analytics. Those who say Excel is not powerful have never learned the advanced functions that Excel can do. Yes, they can slow down with large data sets. But if you can use your other programs to slice and dice your data sets into smaller tables, Excel is a great tool to share that filtered data with your stakeholders.",True

@MrZola1234,2023-09-18T21:57:52Z,0,"It's horrible that spreadsheets are so widely used.  They are inefficient, studies show they tend to be riddled with mistakes.  Excel is as outdated as using a fax.... maybe AI will be the death of Excel.",True

@Flylikea,2023-09-18T13:15:32Z,1,"Excel is the basic thing. It's really not a tool one can choose not to learn because they want to be more technical. You might want to be more technical and use R or python because statistics or sth. So, excel might not be your tool of choice, but it's the basics. Personally, I won't even bother with anyone hiding behind the excuse ""I'm sorry I'm too technical""... laaaazyyyy",True

@papercliprain3222,2023-09-18T11:59:36Z,0,"It’s pretty interesting that once you know one tool the others are easier, I had some experience with SQL and started to learn Excel and it was easy to understand what was happening with stuff like VLOOKUP after already knowing about select statements and joins. I’m starting to learn Salesforce and while they call everything a different name than those other two tools the concepts are roughly the same.",True
@Ultrajamz,2023-09-18T11:43:16Z,7,Yeah… we need to know excel… sadly… mostly to help the less technical… but hearing python in excel is coming is cool.,True
