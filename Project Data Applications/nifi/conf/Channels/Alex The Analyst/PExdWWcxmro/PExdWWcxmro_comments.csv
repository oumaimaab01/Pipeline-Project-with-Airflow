@summer7361,2023-07-06T17:05:10Z,0,"Hey Alex, I started working on my 4th portfolio project. The dataset i chose to use is Stack Overflow annual developer survey for 2022. Initially i was going to analyze developer stats for all countries but after some thought i decided to focus only on developers from my country.   The issue i realized is that there are only 191 entries that i can then use. Is this too few? Would you recommend doing all countries?   Also, if you're familiar with the dataset, could you suggest any questions that i should aim to answer and later visualize?",True

By then, I came to know your videos talking about data analyst, and it was 2 years ago. Deep down, I know data analyst is something for me, but I didn't take the step at the time. I kept switching jobs that I think would help me get better, but none of them seemed to work for me. One day, your vid popped out again, and I guess it was the so-called God sign...haha. I started to follow your vid for tutorials and take the courses you recommended!! After 9 months!!! I'm officially hired as a business analyst! I'm much more happier right now! So everyone who is watching Alex's vid for career transition, believe in him AND yourself! God makes way for you!",True
