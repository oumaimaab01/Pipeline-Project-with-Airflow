Even when you told us ‚Äò‚Ä¶you guys are the ones putting in the hard work to build the portfolio‚Ä¶‚Äô (towards end of video). To create contents such as this video must have taken tremendous work and skills from you. I have been watching Data Analysis related videos from you and others for a while. This is probably the first time I‚Äôm commenting a fair bit to share my thoughts. I had not given much thought before in using SQL for data cleaning process, even though I have known about SQL for many years. So, it‚Äôs good insight to see what you have shown. I‚Äôm more familiar doing the process in Excel using Power Query for example, and possibility of using Pandas for doing it.  Is it practical if doing the data cleaning with one tool first than import to another, based on your experiences?  Around 3:09 I was curious to try the Edit Mapping (bottom above Next).

Concerning  the datetime column the convert is mainly for a display  and when it comes to the change of the column  data type.. then we shifted into the table structure i believe. and that means we need to use ALTER not UPDATE. so the query should be  ALTER TABLE 'table_name' ALTER COLUMN 'column_name'  'data type u want'  so apply in the example in the video ALTER TABLE NashvilleHousing ALTER COLUMN SaleDate Date  and it worked for me. i hope it helps!,True
