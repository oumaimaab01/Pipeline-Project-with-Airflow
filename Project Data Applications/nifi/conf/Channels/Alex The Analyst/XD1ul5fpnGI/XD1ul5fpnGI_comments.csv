@user-cy4qx4yd9h,2024-03-24T20:41:53Z,1,"Hello Alex, the new Analyst Builder and everything it includes is incredible. It's amazing.  I wanted to ask you, if we want to start preparing for a data analyst role from scratch, can we still do your data analyst bootcamp in the order of your videos?  That is, what you teach in your YouTube data analyst bootcamp, can we also learn it within Analyst Builder in a certain order?  Your bootcamp with the 2023 content looks very comprehensive to get started. Does this bootcamp have exercises to practice like Analyst Builder? Or can we complement the data analyst bootcamp with Analyst Builder?  I'm asking so I don't get sidetracked.  Thank you very much Alex,  you have done a tremendous job,  congratulations!",True

I have a job as a pricing analyst and have been there for about 9 months, with no prior analyst experience besides a boot camp. However, I've mostly been stuck doing data entry and issue resolution with a side of technical things like using SQL queries and Python scripting. Long story short, I have a new boss who is expecting me to actually be an analyst, and I'm finding it really tough to learn on the job. Do you have any suggestions on how to get up to speed quickly to meet his expectations? I'd say my technical skills are adequate, but the soft skills that make an analyst aren't as easy to pick up through courses and tutorials.",True
