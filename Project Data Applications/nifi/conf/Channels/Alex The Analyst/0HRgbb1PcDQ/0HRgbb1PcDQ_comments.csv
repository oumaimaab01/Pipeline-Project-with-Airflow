@wwinston3929,2022-08-08T03:20:44Z,0,"Hey Alex, please help. So I‚Äôm currently working as a mechanical engineer at DC and I‚Äôm thinking about self learn and becoming a DA. The biggest reason is because of salary. Im working at a pretty large engineering company right now(over 15000 people globally), my starting salary is 75k, and almost everyone at the company gets a promotion every 2 years and get a salary increase of about 8% (asked a couple ppl within the company to confirm these numbers). So im basically expecting to get paid around 100k in 6 years (which is not bad, dont get me wrong, but i just want to explore other/better opportunities). However, 2 of my friends who‚Äôs working as data analyst at a local marketing company that has less than 200 employees in Maryland, started with similar salary, and gets a raise of 7500 dollars for just working there for 6 month, and expect to get a raise every 6 month at least for the first couple of years(someone we know worked there for 2 years and already making 120k). But, by looking at all the glassdoor/linkedin data, and your video, DAs dont make that much, so do you think this company is an exception? Or would you say most DAs actually do get an increase jn salary that fast? Thanks",True

If you were planning on investing in MUTUAL FUNDS - in your 401K or elsewhere, I strongly suggest investing in INDEX FUNDS instead. The expense ratio (essentially the fee you pay for the privilege of owning the fund) is much higher for mutual funds (~0.5% for the mutual fund, vs ~0.03% for the index fund, YMMV) for no guarantee of better performance (and often a pretty good likelihood of *worse* performance). Half a percent might not seem like much but the difference will snowball over decades of growth.  ...
