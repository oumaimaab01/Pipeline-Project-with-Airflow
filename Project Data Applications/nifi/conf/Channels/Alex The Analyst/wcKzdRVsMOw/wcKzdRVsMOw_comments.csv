If yes, were the recruiters apprehensive about the break in your employment?  Full disclosure, I'm a CS graduate who finished college last year and was working for one year as a junior tech writer. I had to leave this job due to complications caused by COVID and now find myself at an impasse at my career. While I have started working as sports writer just to get an income, I am really looking to get into the Data Analyst profile but I'm worried about having little to no experience, and even though I've started to read up on the latest technologies in the said field, I realise that I'll need a few months to get the hang of it before I actually feel like I can work as an analyst in a corporate environment. So it's making me really anxious as to how badly the lack of work ex would affect me.   So effectively, how many months can I give myself here before I make things complicated for myself?

@sergioramos3437,2020-09-04T22:45:51Z,1,"Holy shit you're in Dallas!? I'm in Fort Worth! Currently taking an IBM data science course .. had previously taken a course on Google sheets and fell in love with it so I thought I'd take a shot at being a data analyst as I'm between jobs right now.. I'm also an artist, and was thinking the domain knowledge would make me a good fit for something in entertainment... Any advice on how to land something like that out here?",True
@carmencurca8494,2020-09-02T15:04:24Z,1,"Hey Alex, I cannot believe I found your videos on YouTube!!! I was having such a hard time finding some real and relevant information on this subject as most of the people talk about data science.   Since you've been enough to offer you expertise in helping data analyst newbies, I wanted to ask your opinion regarding my case. I have been my whole life a travel specialist (airfares and ticketing specialist) and have no other experience whatsoever in data analysis. Since the whole world changed during the past few months, I am now looking for a second career, and I have always wanted to work in this field, but since I don't any education (my bachelor degree is in philology) or experience I always hesitated to try. However, I have already started learning Python a month ago and will focus on SQL also.  Given your knowledge and experience in this field, do you think I have any chance of getting a job after taking all the learning steps you recommended? I have many communication and customer relations skills, as well as working with many software related to my job.   Thanks a lot for proving all this extremely helpful information!",True

@donnelly5757,2020-08-21T20:33:00Z,0,Big question. Would working as a medical billing and coder be a good way to get my foot in the door in this career field? Can it lead anywhere into the data analytics field? I ask this because my VA VR&R counselor is trying to sway me to go this route since the medical billing and coding program that my counselor would hook me up with also helps with job placement. At least from here I figure I would be working and would have a budget to pursue a masters in data science.,True
