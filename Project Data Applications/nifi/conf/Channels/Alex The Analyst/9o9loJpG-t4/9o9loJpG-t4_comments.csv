@tomonhan3109,2020-09-15T16:29:47Z,8,"Late to the party but I just recently found your channel (Loving it). I think perception through average overall gives people a skewed view of salary because wealth distributed across the world is skewed. I think using the median helps paint a better perspective because that shows what will the actual middle man get paid. Suppose the lowest end would be like 10 dollars mid would be 100 and the 100th percentile would be 1000, average salary would yield a much higher value than the median. So people go in thinking they would get paid a lot more, but in reality it is just because people on top makes a significantly larger salary than those in the middle and the bottom.",True

@cosmosnomad,2020-09-04T17:06:29Z,2,"I think most of these salary guides are bullshit tbh. It's just such a one dimensional view of the employment market. For a start, any data analyst will tell you that you need a better idea of the distribution, whether that be a box plot, the IQR, something like that and the majority of salary guides only have the median. This seems one of the few cases that has some extra details. And then they don't appear to define the job titles correctly eg: miss out roles which logically should be there.",True
@JRPapollo,2020-08-27T04:04:16Z,5,"Thank you for this video. I'm 12 years into my IT career and make 80k as a Sr Systems Engineer. I am road mapping my path to six figures and have been focusing on data analytics, because I was under the impression it pays in the 100 - 120 range as standard. I'm learning R and Python and was planning on SQL and Statistics next. I have a degree in mathematics, so I do have some experience there.   I live in the Midwest and there seems to be an incredible amount of wealthy people around, and I have to wonder what they all do to make so much. I am doing well but am still paying off student loans. I don't live extravagantly by any stretch.   Now, I should also qualify, I made way less for most of my career, having graduated after the housing crash in 08. It was a VERY slow climb to get to this point, and I was making lower than average for every title I'd had, until last year.   I am not certain exactly what to do; maybe I should pursue an MBA. Maybe become a software developer. I want more for myself and am willing to work for it. The path just doesn't seem clear.",True

@hypercortical7772,2020-08-16T04:45:55Z,4,"Ok so here's my official mildly researched take: First of all you are probably looking at a different source than what she looked at. This is the 2019 Robert Half Accounting and Finance Salary guide. it forecasts salaries for 2019. The Job you are looking at seems to be specifically for Data Analysts in Corporate Accounting. Robert Half has other salary guides such as the Technology Salary guide. I think She probably looked at the tech guide for 2020. I saw your comment saying it doesn't look like the 2020 version is out yet, but it was definitely out at the time this video was created. I found an article from August 2019 discussing the release of the 2020 Guides. According to the Technology guide, In the tech industry A ""Data Analyst/Report Writer"" Makes $84,750 at the 25th percentile and $100,250 at the 50th percentile (which should be at least approximately the median, I think). These sound a lot like her numbers, she may have taken the 25th percentile and reported it as an entry level salary statistic, which while not entirely honest, is probably not too far off for this particular set of jobs since your entry levels are generally going to be the ones around that 25th percentile mark (i think). Now I'm still not confident we should take the rest at face value. first of all I don't know what proportion of Data Analyst jobs fit into ""Tech"" as opposed to other fields like finance. second, Robert Half is an HR consulting Firm. Their numbers are based on their own placement, and I'm sure that could skew the data, I just don't know how. Also worth considering that She seems to have a very specific idea in her head when she talks about data analysts, different than what most people might think based on job titles. She clearly thinks a lot of ""Data Analyst"" jobs are Not real Data Analysts despite being labeled as such. Maybe this is misleading on her part, but she seems to bring it up constantly so idk. for example: I've seen your video about becoming a Data Analyst with no experience. Based on the way you describe your first data job making 47k I'd imagine she'd say that's more of a ""Data Reporting Analyst"" type job, which she frequently distinguishes from ""Data Analyst"" when she talks about Salaries (not to mention the fact that you got the job seemingly without a particularly relevant degree. I don't think you said, but I imagined something like Psychology or Social Work based on your first two jobs. She usually talks about Math degrees as common for data analyst). And personally, as an aspiring Data Analyst and Aspiring Data Scientist who has spent time around echo chambers like the r/datascience subreddit, I probably Wouldn't think ""Data Analyst"" when I hear that job description. When I think data analyst I expect more statistical tools being involved. For example I'm Working thru a fairly popular textbook called ""Introduction to Statistical Learning with R"" which covers the basics of applied statistical techniques like Regression and Support Vector Machines. I've been under the impression that This is the kind of stuff associated with the term Data Analyst (Along with data queries, and cleaning and stuff)",True
@hypercortical7772,2020-08-16T03:20:19Z,17,"84k did sound high to me. but ~40k also sounds low to me. When I did job searches in my area (which is a city) I saw a lot of entry level stuff from like 55-75k. Entry level stuff past that was usually labeled ""entry level data scientist"" or something like that. Also, I might be wrong but it seems like higher salaries would make sense based on the kinds of degrees these jobs seem to ask for. I almost always see them asking for at least a bachelors in a ""Quantitative field"" which usually includes Math/Stat, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, Computer Science, or engineering. And I could be terribly mistaken as a student with no work experience but I was under the impression those degrees had a tendency to command higher salaries (especially Compsci and Enee). that's what I always hear at least. And I also sometimes see that a masters degree is preferred. I certainly hope people aren't taking on loans for a masters degree to make just 40k. But idk, maybe I've been Na√Øve and I have a rude awakening coming up after graduation.",True
