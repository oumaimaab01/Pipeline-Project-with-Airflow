Went from doing mail merges of 50-250 people into a single master word doc, convert to a master PDF, but then needing to manually extract individual client data by hand, 2-3 pages at a time.... Got tired of it and wrote a VBA Macro that automated it after setting up and starting the mail merge process. Ran on the computer for like, 2mins, ended with 50-250 individual PDFs. And I LOVE it. I'm so hungry for more efficiency/automation work",True

Thank you for taking the time to share your story with us.   I have always loved analyzing data. I retired from the Marine Corps a few years back and have been trying to find my place in a new career. I naturally look toward operations management; it is my comfort zone. I held a position as a Business Analyst as my first role right out of the service and loved the work, but I felt something was missing. I always used data to help me make decisions, but I didn't have the necessary KSAs to take me to the next level, so I went back into operations management.   Based on your recommendations in some other videos, I started taking classes on Coursera. While I have not made it to where I want to be yet, I know I will make it there.  I will touch bases with you in the future with an update once I make it; but, I will say this up front:  Thank you for being a part of my success.   -Andre",True

Your story resembles mine, only that I started in 1989 when I moved to the US, started as a Cobol programmer with Data General mini computers. Thirty something years later I would like to improve my data analytics skills, I have a background on Oracle SQL and MicroStrategy, but I need some top BI tools, e.g. Power BI, Tableau, and polish my Python skills. I will let you know, thanks again for your time.  Jalape√±os by the way.",True
@noor_51,2023-01-25T09:44:45Z,0,"Yes, career change to Data Analytics is very possible and the best thing to have happened to me. Just ensure that you get some credible certifications to prove your competence. This will make it very easy to get recognized among the crowd. There are tons of them, some are even free like the Alteryx certification. I can help guide anyone to pass the Alteryx exams. I am already certified.   Before all these, I graduated with my first degree in Mathematics. However, it was very tough finding a job with that degree. I then started learning Data Analytics on YouTube and acquired intermediate competence in using various software like Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Despite having these skills, it was still very challenging to land my first job because I didn't have the credentials to justify my skills. So I resorted to online freelancing while building my professional network. It was then that an idea struck me to seek certification that could enable me prove my competence in the said areas. However, another major obstacle was that majority of the certifications like Tableau, Power Bi, and Oracle were a bit expensive for me since I didn't have a job yet. So I learnt of Alteryx free certification and aced it https://www.dropbox.com/s/9imtpea345s166h/Alteryx%20Cert.jpg?dl=0. It became a good starting point for me and later on I was able to raise funds and register for the paid certifications. I am glad and appreciative for the progress I have made ever since.",True

@brandijean5186,2022-12-15T23:44:38Z,2,"Hi Alex! Your story is so inspiring to me, as our journey has a lot of similarities. I graduated with an associates degree as a physical therapist assistant, but by the time I graduated I was so burnt out and unenthused with patient care that I knew I couldn't work in the field. Shortly after graduating, and somewhat randomly, I landed a job as a data collection specialist for a local hospital. Right now, I'm looking for a data analyst role and it would be SO COOL if it was with a healthcare analytics company! I truly hope I am following in your footsteps, haha. I have actually just completed my first semester of a computer science bachelor's degree because I really love the subject. While I don't know if I want to be a data analyst forever, I know I want to be one right now - but the journey is incredibly daunting. I appreciate you sharing your story, as I am at my complete wits end trying to find a job. I don't feel like I know enough to get my first job, and the job market seems increasingly competitive.   This gave me some inspiration and hope that someone who doesn't really know a lot about being a data analyst in the grand scheme of things (aka, Me) CAN land an entry level role and go on to be successful. Thank you so much for sharing, and I can't wait to watch more of your videos.  - Brandi",True

I just completed a coursera class in SQL and a mini tutorial on Power BI, I have a 1 year daughter along with my girlfriend and her 7 year old daughter. I realize I need to find a career that has a future. While being a Medical Biller my boss would put me on excel projects since I was the most proficient at it. I became self taught on formulas and would take other excel formulas and see if I could understand and apply them my self. It felt natural and I grew to create tables and charts for her to present to our Owner. I applied for our Analyst position and found out really quickly I was out of my depths. The manager did like my attitude and gave me a list of courses to take. I appreciate this video as I know I have an understanding on what to do next.

Many of the thoughts you share are the same ones I've had/I'm having, since I'm personally kind of in the mid-point of your data analyst story :)  I feel like lots of people had had the same challenges: trying to earn the first or second job knowing almost nothing of the field, or knowing just super-specific stuff but not really how to apply it or how it fits in a data analytics team. But for people out there: don't let this give you impostor syndrome! The truth is most of the data analysts I know now really did not have any formal education on the field before starting their first position (many had maybe just a degree in engineering or business administration, but no coding or data analytics knowledge). These positions are so demanded that I feel like most of them are covered by people that have been self-taught and come from other areas of expertise.  About your specific story Alex, it sounds like you spent so much extra time at every job. It is motivating and inspiring, but for other people I just wanted to say that it is perfectly fine to do your normal amount of work and normal hours, and progression will come anyways if you are professional and work relatively well (and some luck is always great to have). In any normal company, part of your work time should be spent actually learning things from your daily work, so that you can be more productive for your team. I guess I would just like to tell people to take care when putting that extra effort, watch out for burnout, which is very tipical in the field.

I served in the military and came out the service w/ basic skills and no direction (12 years ago).  I worked in IT. I went to a school and got an associates at a college that is no longer operable. That degree did nothing for me. So maybe five/six years later, I decided I wanted to go the security route. That is where the struggle began. No experience, certs or education. I found it challenging to at least get a foot in the door so I gave up. And here we are in 2022. I have no idea how I came across the Data Analyst path, but I'm happy I did.

I found your video to be extremely informative and inspirational on career change and how you navigated pivoting. Through your determination and dedication, you conveyed how it can be done, but what really translated to me most, was the underlying message of limitless possibilities for achieving that which we truly aspire. One thought went through my mind is how you mentioned early on, how you enjoy working with people. I wonder how much you actually get to work with people ‚Äì perhaps in developing improvement processes and analyses for various departments? I also enjoy developing ways for making processes simpler and more efficient, particularly when others haven‚Äôt any idea how and in showing or helping them, this at times can make have such a profound impact.   I do have a pretty simple question for you though (and it isn't about why my script isn‚Äôt working üòâ). My question pertains to working with recruiters directly. You had mentioned those you used initially reached out to you, but can you recommend ways or even companies for initiating these connections in effort to get the job searching started?

This definitely is very helpful and in my case is helping me boost my confidence and know that I'm nowhere in an unrealistic place wishing to become a successful data analyst. I come from a statistician background who had worked as a data analyst! However, that was 16 years ago and then I moved on and became a successful entrepreneur as a manufacturer and supplier to Whole Foods market. Then i became a mom and chose to sell my wonderful business and dedicate myself to my beautiful child. Now, fast forward, I would love to find a way to make myself go back into that dark closet and pull out some really dusty and outdated stuff which were just put away for a very long time!! (my past data-analyst, statistician career!). I'm sure you can tell at this point wishing to pick up my old skills and experience requires a lot of confidence especially because age didn't stop all along those years just to make it even more exciting :P   I enjoy your positive outlook and personality and bottom line i conclude my main tools will be HARD WORK, CONNECTING GENUINELY WITH PEOPLE, and PRESSING ON in applying for jobs!

@scottkelly6350,2022-01-24T13:32:17Z,1,Undoubtedly the best thing you said was that were willing to work endlessly and push endlessly until you got there. It's equally scary and encouraging to see your journey. Scary because of how hard it can be to get someone to believe in you. Encouraging because you did it against all odds. I have embarked on a similar journey. Recently got a SAP certification and am now running up against everyone wanting 4-7 years experience and there not being a lot of space for the new guy and those spots being sucked up by those with related degrees. The message I need to hear to don't give up. I thought the hard part of getting SAP certified. I'm now realizing it is getting the first opportunity. Keep pushing.,True

I wanted to be a Pathologist but my young and dumbselfmade a decision that caused me to have major legal problems  for 10 years of my young life. Since this happened I was lost and felt like that door was closed.  So I just did any and everything. I knew I wanted a great respectful and challenging career but had no idea how to get it. Long story short....I sold cars for 20 years but I have acquired a deep seeded hate for this field. There was just too many bosses not enough Indians in an extremely toxic environment. At the suggestion of a friend that is a software engineer he introduced me to data analytics. I was so in love with this career field......until.. I did extensive research took an Big Data online class....the first class I was lost. I played with SQL but didn't realize we would be going full speed in this class. I crammed and crammed everything I could but decided...I don't want to memorize I really want to know this stuff. So I tried to take a less advanced class and get my money back but they weren't trying to hear it.....then covid happened. I got custody of my 3 grandchildren. We all got covid. I gave up and went to the worst job I ever had in my life back to selling cars thinking things may be better someplace else.....boy was I wrong. Anyway my Long story short...with all my health issues, family issues, ect...I made a 100% decision to become an Analyst at whatever the cost. I am 48 years old and I figured 3 years dedication to learning and putting everything I have to better the rest of my life. I can be an inspiration to myself, my children, grandchildren, and for those changing a career later in life. I  will have a good 7 years to work I'm the field if I live that long but if I do I will be able to plant so many seeds within my family.

Right after the first 5 minutes, i hit the subscribe button because i knew that your desires and efforts in this video gonna great and it really is. I went straight for 40 minutes and its just amazing.   I want to share a bit of my story. I'm recently getting enrolled in my first job. It's a decent job actually, but right now, for this first 4 months, i just don't really get ""The Thing"" that i might wanna struggle and focus with. I get a scholarship for my associate degree and the part of that scholarship is getting a work wherever i obligated into, the location and role that i got was the campus authority. So i can't choose it freely. Well i could say that i have to take it anyway but it is what it is, it's already the consequences so i can't to be an ungrateful person. Since it's pretty harder to get a full-time job rn in Indonesia due to covid19 pandemic  But after this 4 months, i thought to take a detour, to build my own career plan, and that's how i came to this video, which i really grateful that you've share your story. It looks like i won't resign from my job soon, instead i'm just gonna learn more and more about another skills, which might be useful in my job right now, maybe i could solve a basic problem just like you at your first 4 months of current company.  It's never be a short process, just like you mentioned it, but it achievable. Thank you for your great stories and encouragement right at the end part of the video. I'll down to your videos and stories tnat you've upload earlier.   It's such an honor to having you at my exploration moment in my life. Your storytelling skills is amazing, i and other people won't stick into for 40 minutes staright if it don't great. Your stuio's lighting setup were simple but amazing, and ofc the quality of the content is amazing. I hope you're doing well, stay healthy for you, your wife, and Max. Thank you, Alex.

Truth be told I was going to split the 40 mins in two parts üòÜ because I was so damn sleepy. I made it to the end so Jalape√±o! I worked for a big international oil company for ten years and worked with data during migration projects, but never on a real analytical level. Most of the experts told me that you can break into the field without a degree. Sure employers do like degrees but even someone like with me with a high school diploma only, worked on data migration projects with SAP and IBM consultants. Always felt like a imposter though but my contributions were significant on country wide levels. I never bothered to get 'certified' and acquire skills like SQL etc which I regret now. Skills that I decided to start aquiring now. Interestingly enough I told my girlfriend I need additional skills to secure our future financially. That stood out in your video.

I think I'm truly closer to career path I love. I think I'll continue my learning with some of those other data analyst skills because I'm LOVING getting back into SQL.

You really motivated me to start making a change to invest in myself. I‚Äôve had roles where I felt I was the weakest link because I didn‚Äôt have the technical knowledge to perform the job, but because I knew how to ask the right questions and had great people skills my managers really liked me and wished that I had stayed. I have three kids (3, 6, 10) and due to COVID they‚Äôre doing homeschooling but I need to make time to develop my skills so when I‚Äôm ready to go back to work I am competitive. My people skills and experience can only take me so far so I really need to build my technical skills.

I double majored in CS and Bio-tech in Taiwan, and I‚Äôm quite interested in being data analyst or data scientist! I have a lot (not much) of experience of doing machine learning projects in the field of biology, medicine or something like that and I love it, but the salary of being data scientist or data analyst in Taiwan is quite low (about 25k to 35k).

When I moved into a senior position and had to start doing paperwork like costings, purchasings and inventory, I had to work with Excel and that was when I found out I had a liking for calculations driven by logic.   I was always curious to find out more about Excel functions(and later on pivot tables and power query) and analysing my sales & purchases with them. E.g ""if I increased the selling price of a dish, how much more would i be able to make based on the average quantity sold?"" Or ""How much money can I saved if I switched to another supplier for ingredient x or y based on my average usage?"" .. stuff like that.   I only have a diploma in culinary arts and no computer science background. I couldn't get into a university because our family just couldn't afford it, so I went to work   What I like to ask is   1. What age were you when u got you real first job as a data analyst?  2. Would a data analyst job be suitable for me?  3. Arent you afraid that by sharing your codes/scripts(the one that automated a whole day's work into 5mins) people might take it, claim credit for themselves and get rid of you?   Like as a chef, we never give the full recipe, for the fear that evil bosses will take it, get rid of us and higher someone cheaper to do my job.  Sorry for the long comment, your video is very real and i can connect to what you said about having no background but trying something new. You're a good man to share your knowledge and experience!   Thank you Alex ü§ò",True

If so, from where? 2) I've been learning Python and SQL online on/off since the pandemic, and motivation comes and goes. Projects would be logically be a good step to take now.

I am always reading and studying as to what is the next big job trend in the job market, and yes your right (Big Data or Data Science) will be the next big drive in the IT World,  Everything is going to the Cloud and Automation,  I did try the CompTIA  Cloud Essentials (CLO-001) before this exam expired, but didn't pass, at the time I was worried as to where I was going to live, and moving in a pandemic is very stupid  and my landlord at the time sold the house, so I had to move.

I'm thinking a question for you, do you think datas integration in tables is part of Data Analyst Job ? It seems that the company want people that manage everything of datas (maybe to spend less money or/and because they don't know the skills of Data Analyst). In my oponion today and more for the covid situation, a Data Analyst needs to know how to create tables, integrate datas in tables, manage and clean datas with Python then to do vizualisations ( with Power Bi, Tableau, qlik etc ) and finally if possible to go far away with predictions and machine learning (data Scientist)",True

@badeemabidurken4420,2020-10-10T06:10:07Z,1,"Heya.  Thanks for your videos. You're inspiring to listen to. I fully think data analyst is my calling. Born to do it. It feels like about the only thing I could be good at. I felt like dropping some unsolicited self description of why I think I suit the task and maybe someone will find some use in my comment. Or maybe I will just put into words and onto the internet, a feeling that I've found my passion.  I'm a serial dropout. I dropped out of BSc physics/math/python programming, BSc biochemistry, Cert computing, Cert IT. I passed diploma in business, Certificate in personal training. And there is a handful of other small courses and minor papers I picked up too with mixed success. Psychology, stats, geology, plumbing and some others. I was unstable in many ways and sticking to something has been a challenge, despite plenty of A's along the way which became F's when I stopped attending.  I truly love love abstract, theoretical, technical problem solving and especially analysis. I love getting to the bottom of a pool of data and deciding what it all means and how it can justify how best to approach a complex problem. I've been curious my whole life and taught myself all manor of things on the internet from political theories to particle physics, psychology and cosmology. I've carried this momentum by myself my whole life (I'm now 30) with no-one to share it with or discuss it with as no-one around me is curious minded. Discussions about any of this is always derailed or twisted into a dismissive joke.  I've had about 27 jobs in my life. All blue collar which was so droll. I spent a long time depressed as hell because I was looking at the stars while stacking boxes, warehousing, cleaning or doing factory work. I had to do it to pay bills and I never really had the time to slow down and work on something on the side. My parents always demanded a lot of my time to help them on the farm. They're far more simple, practical, concrete and shallow minded people. So any of my intrigue was always met with frustration and exasperation as it wasn't related to the menial task at hand. I'm even pretty accomplished in the alpaca shearing shed now. I'm possibly the second best alpaca shearers hand in New Zealand. I chose not to move up to alpaca shearer because the work is more challenging and physical than is imaginable without first person experience. 13 hour days 7 days a week for 100 days straight if you are keen and get into it. Average joe would be flat as a pancake by morning tea time with the physicality of this job.  I've just completed building myself a 3 screen PC perfect for a workstation and learning from. I can't wait to rip into all of this. I'm hungry for the knowledge and can't wait to enter this whole new exciting field of curiosity food. An IT friend of mine has recommended that I do my Comptia A+ certification and get into helpdesk for a good entry into the IT industry and then I can go from there to start learning data analysis. I hope this is a good direction, as I have just started in this direction. I'm not daunted by the mountain of knowledge to come as I proved to myself in physics that I can get A grades in the face of a challenging workload of complicated info. Lets Go!  I don't really expect anyone to read this. Just started typing and this is what came out. Hope you enjoyed the read anyone who did read it. Any feedback or suggestions related to anything I wrote would be well received and appreciated.  Oh nearly forgot to mention. I like Jalapenos too.",True

It's enlightening and refreshing to see the light at the end of the road. As I research different skill set to become a data analysis and jalapeno :-) I find more opportunities to explore and learn. I welcome the challenge not only for my career but to be an example for my two young boys. As for your career change, it reminds me of the question teachers ask you in elementary school, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?'. For a young mind or even a mature one, the answer can easily change with new life experiences such as you said marriage, kids, and simply just learning things you like. I wanted to be an artist. I went to college and graduated with a degree in Visual Communication (Graphic Design). My last employment was in operations where I learned MSSQL. Like you, I was self-taught and created time-saving solutions while working on projects no one wanted or rather projects I created. Great experience. I was in the position of applying to an application support specialist within the same company before the COVID pandemic hit. Still grateful for the experience with the company and pushing forward to learning more. Thanks again for sharing.",True
