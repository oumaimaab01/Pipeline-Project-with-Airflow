The performance of these are really geared toward productivity based processing.  If you are using a laptop for gaming then get a standard SSD, if you're doing any productivity get the NVMe.  Alex:  This is partially why you feel your laptop is super fast, because the read/write speeds of your SSD are approaching the speed of your RAM, which is on the higher (if not highest) end.  Significantly greater than standard SSD since it has NVMe.  ""If you can swing it..."" then I would recommend 1GB of NVMe primary storage and 16GB of RAM personally.

@usuallyclueless4477,2021-04-19T20:56:19Z,6,"Nice video! About the processor, i3-i5-i7-i9 are classes, and does not denote how new they are. A first gen i7 (from 2009 or so) is painfully slow by today's standards. Even a 7th gen i7 (from 2016)  is comparable to a 10th gen i3 from 2020 in terms of performance. The current gen is 11th on Intel and 5000 series on AMD (yours is the 4800h, which is still an absolute monster even though its one gen old.) but most stuff sold on the market are generally new (3 generations old MAX). On laptops, the processors with the 'H' suffix are high powered ones while the 'U' series are power saving processors used in thin and light laptops that don't have much cooling potential. The U series consume less power, but are also comparatively slow.",True

@ldsudduthhanover,2021-03-30T12:57:07Z,13,"Intel i5 vs i7 (10th Gen: Comet Lake and 11th Gen: Tiger Lake) The i5 (for laptops) is a  4-core CPU, with a boost clock speed of just over 4Ghz. Intel now supports hyperthreading in their i5 line, so for a laptop, this would be a 4-core, 8-thread processor. More than enough horsepower for even 3D modeling. The i7 in the Comet Lake line is a 6-core, 12-thread chip.  Honestly, in the i5 vs i7 debate, unless you're doing some seriously huge data calculations and dealing with advanced 3d modeling, the i5 chipset is perfectly suited.   Ryzen 5 vs Ryzen 7 (AMD):  The latest-gen Ryzen 5 chip is a 6-core, 12-thread chip (comparable to the i7), while the Ryzen7 is an 8-core, 16-thread chip. Either is well suited for crunching numbers and doing data visualizations.  In both cases, it all boils down to how much you want to pay (or can afford to pay).   I'm firmly on the Red Team (AMD) side.  I got a deal on a Dell with a Ryzen 7 chip recently for just shy of $600.  :)",True
