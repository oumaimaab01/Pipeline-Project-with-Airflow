@KylianMbappe07303,2024-05-17T04:17:20Z,0,"quick note  if you have UNEQUAL ROWS  set the columns which are present on the econd database table but not the fist database table as NULL set the columns which are present on the first database table but not the second database table as NULL  since union actually merges so it will create additional rows to merge those columns NOW IF WE PUT NUILL IT WILL MATCH THE UMBER OF ROWS",True
