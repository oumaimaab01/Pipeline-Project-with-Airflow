@triedntruefitness,2020-08-13T02:15:34Z,0,"Can you elaborate on the revealing finding that most of the jobs on linkedin, glassdoor, etc. are bogus, not real or are already filled?   Also I took your advice and was contacting recruiters on Linkedin, they have been asking for resume submissions and they saying they are keeping me on file. In your experience is this indicative of a weak demand market in my area or a bad resume that is turning them off? I have SQL, Advanced Excel, python, and Power BI portfolios on the resume and experience with supply chain analytics on the resume.  Thanks you're an inspiration to all of us trying to get an entry level job in the field and are a huge help!",True
