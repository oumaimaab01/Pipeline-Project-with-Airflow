@donnelly5757,2020-08-29T17:51:05Z,1,"Wishing I had not missed this! I have been studying and practicing SQL for over a year now, and over 6 months of experience using Python demonstrated by doing projects which I have posted on GitHub. I have a masters in exercise science, though many consider the degree useless, the program I did was research intensive with doing a lot of data analysis using Excel and SPSS. My long term goal is to become a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and or data engineer. My short term goal is to land an entry level job whether it be as a data analyst, database administrator, or entry level database developer. My question is will getting an Oracle Database 12c Administrator Certified Associate Certification greatly improve my odds of finding work? I plan to take a certification course through Syracuse University this fall and have heard its very intense. My other option was SAS Base Level Programmer, but I have seen videos and read forums where SAS is being replaced with R and Python and that SAS will eventually fade out.",True
