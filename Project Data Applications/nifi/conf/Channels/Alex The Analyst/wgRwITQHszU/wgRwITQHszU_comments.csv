@inurspace,2024-02-16T02:32:33Z,1,"Thankyou Alex for a great starting tutorial. At work I have to move from my Access database to MySQL after working with that student Db for near on 16 years, goodbye old friend. Anyway, I tried installing MySQL on my own yesterday at work and couldn't get it right. Looked for some tutorials, but they were either hard to understand the accent or too old a version of MySQL. Today I found your tutorial, which helped me install it on my home PC in no time and I'm now up and running. (Will have to fix it up at work on Monday). I look forward to the next tutorial, as soon as I can get a chance. BTW, Parks and Rec are one of my favourite shows. Thanks again.",True

@hoangng16,2024-01-11T03:08:42Z,0,"Hi Alex, may I have some questions?  I have multiple large tables in CSV format. Usually, I will handle my CSV using Python or R, but this time, my local machine can't handle the data, so I'm learning about AWS RDS. So far, I have imported the large CSV to MySQL Workbench and done some computations (e.g., sum, mean, etc.). The next step is to make some visualization using the computation result. Should I:  1. Export the result to AWS S3, then sync it to SageMaker for using a notebook instance for visualize the result, or 2. Connect the SageMaker notebook to AWS RDS directly for visualization?  Thank you so much!",True
