@user-kq3tc5tu1c,2024-05-13T01:35:27Z,0,"Great refresher on both LIMIT and ALIASING.  For example, I don't think I've ever come across the whole ""limit a certain number of rows"" THEN ""return the NEXT row"" technique before.  Wow, I knew I had a lot to learn and, in some cases, relearn...  Good thing you have the Intermediate & Advanced lessons ready for me when I get there.  Keep this up and you're going to get a Christmas card!  Cheers ",True
