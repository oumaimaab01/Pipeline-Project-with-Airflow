@WaliSayed,2023-11-29T05:12:38Z,0,"Thanks, it is useful however what I realised is that No SQL databases store data in an unstructured way with low latency of data retrieval and a new field can be added without a major issue.",True

Thank you for this video bud! New subscriber here!",True
@lody33100,2022-07-27T23:19:35Z,0,Is that means there are chances for the sql to be no longer wanted in the few next years?,True
@fy7589,2022-05-18T06:34:50Z,3,"I use SQL for things like storing integer, decimal and boolean values and email addresses and password hashes. I always keep the sql table size relatively small. For large datas such as long text, image address et cetera, I use mongodb and I store the Id of the row from the SQL in the mongodb docs. I first select the values from the sql database then by the Id of that row, I select the mongodb doc's data. This way I reduce the select query load time significantly because when the sql memory size is kept small, it's much easier to select the id and then instantly find the document you're looking for from the mongodb. Also one more keynote to take here is that It's always good to make sure you overclock the memory and manually adjust the memory timings. For example if your tRFC timing is ridiculously high by default, drop it to something like 400-500, also If your tREFI timing is low like 9000, increase it to like 32000 or even more if you're not on an hedt platform. This way it'll take much less time to refresh the memory and you'll have more cycles to access to the memory. But you gotta run linpack xtreme and memtest and if you can, plug a gpu in and run a time spy loop in order to validate stability.",True

@rodolforincon8431,2022-05-04T18:17:05Z,2,"Just putting this out there, the reason why SQL doesnt handle big/large transactions well, is cause of the ACID properties, specially the i, which is isolation, meaning transactions happen wihtout interrupting or affecting others, thanks to that, many sql databases lock the rows or columns being used, so in the case of receiving large and many queries, its easy tor each the point where you are trying to access data thats been locked thanks to a previous query, so its kinda like a bottleneck",True
