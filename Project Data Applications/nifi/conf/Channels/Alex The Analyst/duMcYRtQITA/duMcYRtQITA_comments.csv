Having it be taught in R could be a good thing: it adds an additional programming language to your skills set. I'll be devoting 40-50 hours a week between this course and my Python college course as I am determined to put an end to my roommate saga by getting a good paying job and get my own place before before the end of 2021!,True

@4pastelribbons,2021-03-04T16:22:31Z,6,I was wondering if i should complete the ibm data analyst professional certificate by coursera or this google for data analyst certificate? i find the former a lot more comprehensive than the google cert but the hiring feature that google is offering is the part when im considering to take the google cert first!,True

@fekifeko56,2021-03-04T14:38:23Z,1,"Hey Alex ! loved the video, I have a question though : looking at what this Google certification is going to be, do you still recommend the Udemy SQL / Tableau courses ? or is it better to simply go with Google for SQL / R / Tableau and learn the rest (Python/ Power BI .. etc) through Udemy and Coursera ?",True
@matthewchelel790,2021-03-04T14:28:33Z,2,Alex - your videos are amazing and so insightful.  You make me want to become a data analyst.. lol.

@NugrohoBudianggoro,2021-03-04T13:12:10Z,10,"some points crossed my mind: - the r part is placed near the end of the curriculum after data cleaning. this may mean they will teach the cleaning part primarily using spreadsheets. - i'm a bit disappointed they don't mention google data studio. its their own platform and it is getting quite traction in the job market afaik.  that's it. i'm also disappointed the don't mention python. so far i practiced using python so i'd need to add r language to my skills-to-study-more-first (alongside excel, tableau, and basic statistics).  anyway they have this session discussing the certificate. it's only available for u.s. and canada audiences. could you please give review on that session too in case they don't make in available later? thanks.",True
