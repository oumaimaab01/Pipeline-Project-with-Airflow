@alikarimi-langroodi5402,2022-08-10T14:37:10Z,0,"Data:  Cognition is all about using data. Without data, nothing is comprehensible or understandable. Once you understand what you need to know, then you can put it in words and tell others.  It is difficult to summarise your findings without data. Alot depends on your common sense or previous knowledge.  Data is the most valuable part of any creature, including plants and other animals.   Even babies use and manipulate their data, using different experiments they plan, devise, and execute using their common sense.   Mostly they use their senses to gather data, the initial trigger to find anything at all. Sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch is all they need to find what to do next.  This is all we do as machines. ‚ÄòWhat is the next thing to do - to put all the information together to figure out an understanding.  Without some or all of the senses, learning would be much harder, but not impossible. It is known that a natural machine can function without a body. This would be impossible in robots. Without programming, no machine can ever work.  The following are the steps even used by babies to make sure what their environment is all about.   What to do or what not to do next is the object of any finding.   Babies gather their data, store it to use for the next time. Though the process has not exactly been mapped out by neuroscientists, yet. As time passes, a perfect picture of the understanding appears in memory.  Neuroscientists should be able to put the process into some form of a model and perhaps feed it to a robot to understand the subject.  How much data is needed to understand any particular incident, event, or the subject with all the senses available depends on the common sense of the robot.  Unfortunately, there is no method available to feed common sense into a robot without repeated experiments and trial and error, all creatures use to understand everything at all.  Complexities are the barriers to understanding, but using the Al-Kharazmi‚Äôs method to use some predetermined steps, it is possible to reduce complexities. We can then use the same procedure again and again in any set of experiments for fact finding.   Kharazmi, the first mathematician who invented ‚Äòalgorithm‚Äô after his name, used his most simple steps using only a pen and paper to figure out the size of the earth and a lot of observations.  These following steps are crucial in understanding anything at all, regardless of the complexities.  1- The first step is to absorb the data, otherwise it will be no good to you. That means you need to pay attention to your senses.   Often two or more senses help more in understanding what you need to know. Your learning will increase with all your senses working at the same time and decrease without them.  2- The second step is to observe the outcome and record it. Recording takes place making sure you have all the data needed. Sometimes more senses help more to control the recording.  3- The third step is using your body to adjust to your finding. A sudan action may be needed to respond to the finding. This may be crucial in protecting yourself against any unwanted consequence.  Children use these three processes alone to find out anything that may be dangerous to them, like fire or high voltage electricity. Other dangers like falling from a height are already pre programmed into their genes.  Storing the information in a compact form happens automatically in any natural brain, including plants or us.   However for robots storage is a problem they can‚Äôt deal with, unless programmed in the hardware. That is called ‚Äòfirmware‚Äô, using the machine language. Machine language only uses zero and one to keep the data.  4- The last step is retrieving the result quickly enough upon usage.   In robots, this process is extremely complicated using mechanical devices for control. The controls are applying brakes or power to any motor that needs to be switched on or off to control the speed of the movements necessary, generating the required result in time.  For babies these processes happen naturally and without using any preprogrammed help, other than the genes.   Babies use their senses alone in learning any process, until their mother tongue language develops.  Once the language is developed, there is no stopping in learning at all. The machine, the human body, is able to learn anything by itself, using positive encouragement of those involved.   Physical impediments are the only limit to what we are able to do.  Data and information becomes one and the same thing for us, but not for any other machines.",True

I recently graduated with a BS in International Business and would like to pursue a career in data analytics, probably in the fields of business, marketing, or economics. Because of the way the programs at my university's business school are laid out, I could go back and do 2 part-time semesters, while continuing to work my current job, to receive a BS in Information Systems with a focus in Business Analytics. This would be cheaper than most of the boot camps I've seen, and seemingly from a more legitimate institution. Is this something you would recommend? I'm not sure if the same knowledge/experience could be achieved/demonstrated through a cheaper or easier channel. Much love from North Cack, and keep up the good work.",True
