Yes, people will have to become specialized in the specific areas of data  as it pertains to their occuption and field. It just like web design and web development. Now anyone can create a simple basic web page and UX design. All they have to do is tweak things around.

And many things you have to just skip. Yes AI is will be essential, but not all of it.  At the end there is no guarantee that you will succeed if you constantly learn and learn, because unlike a robot you are a human. You will have an age, a life, a familiy situation in this game.   Me. I got into Business Intelligence in 2012. I learned old school BI and the principles of data warehousing. SQL was king. Python was good to know, then but C# better. Then my speciality became BI reports.  Big data came, i didnt jump on board.  Data Analyst roles came but I did jump on board. They sais much would would die, but as we know this is not the case.  I still call me only ""BI developer witin Microsoft stack"". I am not that attractive in many roles now.But for those roles I want (Power BI combined with Azure cloud migration) I enjoy them, because I feel I have made a craft of my skills now and perhaps found employers what suits my well being and happiness  rather than all the time my ""career ambition"". I still have jobs.  To peole who feel AI  stressed id say:  1) Think of economy and the businesses you like to work within. How would AI be used in them? 2) Think system architecture, learn achitectural aspects. 3) AI + regulatory aspects within 10 years. 3) Learn testing and error handling in general.

I don't want to cite names but we've been told for couples of years now that AI will drive ours cars around and no need for a steering wheel which might mean the end of millions of jobs such as truck drivers, cab drivers...etc. But till now, AI has not achieved this result even though a significant progress has been made but these AIs are barely assisting you in your driving and no sane human would trust it fully. I think as far as we don't achieve AGI, these are merely tools that can assist us in our jobs as Data Analysts and make us more productive. Edge cases and messy data are hard to deal with and this is why AI in cars are sturggling so far because of edges cases and human behvaior which are really hard to model.",True

@barbaraam7256,2023-05-21T22:57:42Z,1,"Jalapeño, thanks for this video. I'm at senior level now, but I'm also very worried because I see how many companies don't care about depth or precision. So AI would be a good substitute for them. Even with qualified and expensive employees they don't care too much about data, imagine with cheap AI.   But I hope you are right. I don't think our jobs will vanish within two years... hopefully. Maybe the jobs at big companies will reduce a lot, but there are a lot of small companies that could get a lot of help with us and some soft AI. I don't see how AI will manage those non sense requests from that marketing guy that thinks we are wizards and show our reports misinterpreting EVERYTHING we say to the CEO, so we have to babysit to not send the company to bankrupcy, lol.  But I think only very multidisciplined workers will have a good spot at the sun when AI becomes massive, and not only for data analytics. So you'll have to have some knowledge with data, and statistics, and programming, and business, and social media, and health care, and botanics, and tarot, and sailing, and feta cheese. Then you'll be valuable. What I'm doing now is to study (like always), dive in into topics and knowledges of the area, try to expand my knowledge into everything I think it would be apreciated, but to understand the concepts behind it and be able to validate some AI prompt when needed, just like you said.   And if AI becomes so massive that no one have any job, then we will all be ruined together, right? Like we are all together shaking with anxiety. Sad, but true. Huge hugh to you, stay strong and thanks again for the video",True

The biggest problem is whenever a new technology comes out, management goes nuts trying to use the new tech for everything. Managers want to show they have used the new tech to their bosses, even if the final product is clumsy and inefficient. I'm remembering XML in the early 2000's.  A great tool when used as intended. I saw data being stored in XML format on database systems and blowing storage space out of the water, only because somebody wanted to get a bigger bonus showing they used the new tech.  The hardest obstacle I see is for entry-level analysts is hiring managers believing AI can do their job,  forgetting every mid-level and senior analyst had to start somewhere.",True

While I did some data work in my previous job, it was maybe 1/3 of that job, and I’ve been very excited to finally get a rile that’s 100% analytics (the 40% raise has been really nice too!).

I also found ChatGPT outdated in some of it's recommendations, and this will always be AI's Achilles heel, it will always lag behind product development.",True
@matt_milack,2023-05-15T12:44:51Z,10,"If AI make majority of people globally jobless, because companies, corporations and conglomerates will significantly reduce the amount of their worker, how will they make more profit if all of those jobless people will not be able to buy their products and services?  Basically, if teams of 10 workers get reduced to 2 workers, across all industries, globally, that means that 80% of people who used to buy companies products and services will not be able to do so anymore, because they will  be jobless. So, I don't get how reducing costs by automation makes sense for companies if they lose 80% of their previous market.",True
