@DarkRaviForDeath,2023-12-26T14:03:49Z,3,"I just want to complain a bit here. I have a MSc in math and finished it two years ago from today. This mean's I've been job hunting for two years and am completely miserable stuck in my parents house. I've tried everything and more that you've mentioned above, including reaching out to recruiters, cold applying, asking for virtual coffee chats, building a presence on LinkedIn, etc.   Just this year I've applied to over 1000 jobs now with only 1 interview, which was a senior data scientist position if you can believe it. I guess senior positions have less competition - starting to think its better to upskill to a mid level now and then go for those jobs and senior positions since entry level isn't a thing anymore.   I did a bootcamp too but of course they are all mediocre at best. Honestly, after recently seeing a random youtube video of a 19 year old lie on his resume and get a job, I'm not gonna lie and say I'm not tempted to do this at this point. I am in Canada though, if that makes a difference. We do have some immigration issues it seems.",True
