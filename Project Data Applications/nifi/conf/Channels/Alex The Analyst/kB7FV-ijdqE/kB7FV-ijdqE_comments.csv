@kirillfedtsov,2023-07-23T23:04:20Z,0,"I came here because I needed to filter and order some csv files on backend and then send filtered\ordered csv files back. First I figured csv module is probably what I need but it's actually useless for ordering and filtering. Then I though I will just export everything into postgres, filter it there and then export it back into csv. And strangely enough the best way to export csv into postgres using python was suggested to be with pandas! And then I though: 'wait, why do I even need sql if I can manage my data in a dataframe and export  it back into csv'. So here I am! Excited to learn!  Alex, thanks for the video!",True

@huntercoleman1347,2023-03-07T15:14:19Z,17,"Excellent video. If I could give it 2 thumbs up I would. I especially like how he gets right to the point and doesn't waste the viewers time.  The whole video is filled with useful information. Tutorials where the host spends 10 minutes telling you what they're going to tell you, before they tell you are infuriating. So are videos that are an hour long but only have two or three actual pieces of information in them. This was the perfect video on the topic of filtering columns and rows in Pandas. Thanks Alex.",True
