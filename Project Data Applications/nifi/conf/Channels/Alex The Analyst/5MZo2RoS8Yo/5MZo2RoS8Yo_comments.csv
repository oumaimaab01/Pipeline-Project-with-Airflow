I am already excited and motivated to move forward with Data Analysis with Python from Coursera again. Before that, I would like to ask a few questions:  1) SQL from Coursera is a very excellent course, it did increase my morale. But I would like to practise different datasets and SQL queries on any online web platform. Please recommend a few platforms, if possible.  2) Coursera SQL has smoothly traversed from beginner level to advanced level. But I am a bit sceptical about how much in-depth knowledge of SQL is required in Data Analyst job?

@donnelly5757,2020-09-13T07:18:48Z,5,"This video gives me a lot of hope in regards to what I have been learning and what skills I acquired in graduate school even if my degree is not on par with some of the more quantitative degrees out there! With having spent over three years in college to do undergraduate and graduate level projects including my thesis using Excel and SPSS, I think with some quick review, Excel should not pose an issue. This fall I am taking an Oracle Database 12c Administrator Associate Certification course which I'm assuming I will learn more advanced SQL queries along with some other DBA skills. At the same time, I will be learning Tableau and Power BI on my own. I hope 2021 is the year I finally land a solid entry level job.",True
@malcorub,2020-09-12T01:38:34Z,4,"Great video sir... regarding going back to school for a masters 6:00 , not always necessary but if one does I am of the opinion that employers respect that more that one goes to school in their 30's or 40's as a working professional versus someone that did it in their early 20's.  My humble opinion is that it shows maturity and dedication to the profession.",True
