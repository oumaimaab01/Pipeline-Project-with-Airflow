@user-kq3tc5tu1c,2024-05-16T02:22:52Z,5,"Good Evening Alex, back at it again tonight.  Temp Tables in MySQL has been as instructive and as enjoyable as all of the other videos in the series.  Again, I'm really grateful (all ""thumbs up"" have been mashed throughout the course) to have all of this valuable knowledge in one spot.  Jim Kwik says ""Knowledge isn't power, it is potential power.  What we do with the knowledge is the power.""  Hoping to use your concepts at work to apply the power of your courses.  Thanks for all of your time and effort.  Cheers!  BB üòé",True
