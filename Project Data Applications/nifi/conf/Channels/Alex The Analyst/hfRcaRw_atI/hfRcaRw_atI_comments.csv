@vishesharora2352,2021-01-18T18:22:04Z,28,"I got asked a lot of questions on leadership, working in a group/team, conflict resolution, and making mistakes (or major failures) during almost all of my interviews. Thankfully, I could think on my feet and come up with an answer almost immediately! But I'll definitely prepare for such questions from now on.  Just to add on, maybe one more point could be to know your resume in and out. The last thing you'd want is the interviewer to ask ""So why don't you tell me about xyz thing that you've written on your resume"", and you've completely forgotten about that project (or whatever the interviewer is asking for) and end up giving some vague answer. It just leaves a bad impression.",True

@Holt196,2021-01-05T15:33:49Z,71,"What has worked really well for me in the past is asking about the background of the interviewer. It seems like a weird question, but it can be a really nice change of pace for a recruiter and it can be very helpful information if a potential future colleague is interviewing you! One time a recruiter went off on a full tangent and afterwards said they enjoyed a lovely conversation; what followed was him constantly going the extra mile for me and landing a pretty awesome position in 3 weeks or so",True
