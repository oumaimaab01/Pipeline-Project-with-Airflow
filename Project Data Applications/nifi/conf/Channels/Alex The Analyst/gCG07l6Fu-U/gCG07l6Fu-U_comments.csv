@DarrellWolfe,2023-05-02T03:10:19Z,5,"I know this is going to sound crazy to some people following this conversation. I've never made more than I do right now, working for the county, making $58K. A salary of $65 doesn't sound low it sounds unattainable. I'm so glad I started the Google Certification for Data Analyst, and then I'm doing Business Intelligence too. I already am an Excel power user, dax, powerpivot, power query, power BI, Tableau, SQL... I had no idea that was marketable to other areas. I need to get out of government. üòÇ",True

@ImpulzReponz,2023-03-25T02:32:13Z,5,Alex is spot on. Such a great presentation. These same approaches go for learning everything in tech.... especially building projects. Sometimes we all need to be reminded to break the tutorial trap and get started.,True

@BR0STRADAMUS,2023-03-01T22:35:39Z,8,"Taking breaks spoke to me on a spiritual level haha. I'm also in the CF Data Analytics course and working on my final project. I spent an hour writing a complex Python function to iterate through a large data frame and then create a new column based on seperate columns from different years in the data frame. I took a break while the function was running (it took close to 20 minutes to finish!) and during my break I realized I could just use a simple .loc method to accomplish the same task much quicker and with much less memory. Definitely a face palm moment, but taking that extra time just to think things through while eating a snack really saved a lot of time and energy for other column changes",True
