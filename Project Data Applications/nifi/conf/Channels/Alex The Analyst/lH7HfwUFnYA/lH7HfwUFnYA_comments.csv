@fabienneramon6316,2023-05-10T09:15:34Z,7,"Hi Alex, I have what may be a dumb questions, but i'll ask it anyway!  I am a 45 year old mum of two living in the UK, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer 10 years ago and who hasn't worked for 10 years.  Long story short i'm still not dead and don't plan to be any time soon contrary to what I was told, sooooo.......I will be returning to work this year and hopefully thanks to your amazing channel going back as a Data Analyst (I was previously an IT Project Manager in to financial services (a pretty clueless one at that)).   My strategy for completeness is to watch all your videos through once (check), then once more making notes to embed (just finished the excel series), then to go through them all and do the practical aspect and practice the skills, then get online certifications in these areas and then volunteer to work for free for a month or so in any local organisations who may need someone to tidy up their data etc to get some practical in house experience and then go through the interview job searching aspect.  So firstly thank you so much for giving me hope there is an after children career for me that I can grow and build on over the next 20 years of employability. So after my long preamble to show you what kinds of different lives of the people you are reaching out to.  Is there a reason there is not intermediate or advanced video's for Excel in the toolkit?   Thank you in advance for your reply and again, thank you very much for you kindness of spirit and generosity as I could never afford to pay for these courses myself and would therefore still be stumped and scratching around for bit's and bob's here and there.

@jerrydellasala7643,2021-12-28T12:58:59Z,1,"The demo is using the wrong technique for changing the format of the data. By highlighting the area of the pivot table and selecting Currency from the Home tab's drop down, you are formatting the cells, not the data. Doing it that way, when you add a column for the next year (2017), it will NOT be formatted properly. To format the data, right click on any value and select Number Format. The same window that's used for formatting numbers in cells will pop up, but it will not have any other tabs (Font, Fill, etc.). If you set the number format this way, when a year is added to the Pivot Table, it will be properly formatted because the underlying format of the Revenue data is Currency. Also, although this may be personal preference, I prefer using Slicers rather than Filters as they are much easier to use.",True
