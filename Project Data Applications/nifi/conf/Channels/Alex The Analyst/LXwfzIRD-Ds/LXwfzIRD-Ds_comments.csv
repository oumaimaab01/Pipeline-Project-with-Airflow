My question is I have completed Series 1. But now what? Obviously i can transition over into the intermediate series sure. But I definitely do not have the basics down. Unless I missed this somewhere i do not see any hands on experience besides following along. I tried Khan academy, but idk if its a glitch in their software but they dont actually explain if your doing right or wrong. You just move along. So how or where do we practice. Ill admit the easiest option is to just make things up and play around, but ill admit until im comfortable with the basics i dont know what i dont know so its hard to be creative when your still so new. (its like someone saying learn excel, or google sheets but if you have no idea what can even be accomplished or know what can be done your just learning a function.) I guess my only request is i wish there was more practice offered, or even references of where to practice that will help learn the basics and become more comfortable.
