I noticed that on minute 7 when you were giving the example for 'IN' you accidentally mentioned ""AND"" however the 'IN' is used for 'OR'.

In above mentioned query, we are looking for someone with both Jim and Michael as their firstname.  Instead, we are looking for rows where FirstName is either Jim or Michael.  We can achieve this by simply using OR operator instead of AND operator.  SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics WHERE FirstName = ‚ÄúJim‚Äù OR FirstName=‚ÄúMichael‚Äù;  Rather than writing multiple OR operator like above, we can use IN.
