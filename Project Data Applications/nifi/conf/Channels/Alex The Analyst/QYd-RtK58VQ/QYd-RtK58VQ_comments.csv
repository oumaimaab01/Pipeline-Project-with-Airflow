@anuboluwaji635,2024-04-23T18:21:37Z,1,"Hey Alex, thank you for the info! I would like to talk to you about the data analyst boot camp. I saw that you removed the SQL videos that were in the boot camp series and replaced them with MySQL. For the past several weeks, I have been trying to work on the boot camp because I want to get your certification, and hiccups were trying to work on SQL because I was getting errors when I was trying to work on the SQL projects. Now, I am about to work and complete the SQL data cleaning project which was in the bootcamp series and the last thing to do for the SQL series, but I saw again that the SQL videos were gone. My question is can I still get the certification although you replaced the SQL videos with MySQL? By the way, I do not have MySQL.  Thank you and God Bless!",True
