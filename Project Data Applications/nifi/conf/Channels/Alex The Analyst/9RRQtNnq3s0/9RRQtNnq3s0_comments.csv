@shivasuresh5957,2021-05-06T18:57:14Z,23,"Hi Alex, thanks so much for introducing the Google Data Analytics Certificate program to us. I completed all 7 courses plus the capstone project to obtain the certification. I started around March 18th so it feels good to successfully finish it. I spent many hours the last 6-7 weeks going through the courses so it does involve a certain amount of commitment but it is worth it since I learned quite a bit about best practices in data analysis. I was a bit skeptical about R since I have been using Python but now I have a very basic understanding of R as well. R wasn't too hard to pick up since it also uses packages and data frames similar to Python. There are some differences in syntax as to be expected. Thanks again for bringing the program to my attention.",True

It seems a bit slow at the moment (even with videos at 2x speed) .    A big upside of this course is that is has all the necessary skills aggregated in one place.   I think I just learn better from reading documents with exercises (instead of videos).  Does anyone have a suggestion a compiled list of quality readings/exercises for data analytics skills?  Good luck to everyone in their journey!! :),True

I've heard nothing but how valuable data analysts are and how much quality analysts are needed. With the cert, it almost seems like Google is trying to flood the market, so to speak. And we all know that when there's an over-abundance of something, the value of it decreases. Plus, there's also so much talk about how many aspects of data analysis might become automated in the near future. Idk.
