I am currently doing the coursera google cert for data analytics right now, and had to a mini project using Tableau (which was really bothersome for me as the intructor didn't even mention where she got her dataset from ie what was the title of the set). I am learning a lot more through you videos on Tableau. I have already learned that in the excel sheet the attributes in the sheet become the list at the left hand side when you are making your graphs and charts (through my own experimentation ie making up a dataset using 5-6 attributes)...I like your video as it is more subdued and calm...",True

@amystucker4282,2021-10-02T04:50:55Z,92,"Just popping in to say that your videos helped me immensely in creating a path toward gaining the skills that would eventually land me my first job in data analytics. Your series on building a portfolio was probably the most helpful in helping me understand how to transition into this new career. After 7 months of online studies (including learning from your videos!), and nearly 100 job applications later, I was finally offered a job as a marketing analyst. I've been at this role a little over a month, and I still can't believe I get paid to do something so fun. It feels like I'm just solving puzzles all day! I signed up for an Alteryx training the other day, and I was pleasantly surprised and stoked to see you as one of the speakers. Your videos helped me land this job, and now I get to watch your trainings as a part of my job! Thank you for all you're doing for us newbies to the field!",True
