@liamhays3181,2023-11-17T10:14:29Z,83,What I hated the most when I was starting on my main channel was that I had better content and videos generally than most of the bigger youtubers but i just couldn't move from a dead point. Here is my advice for beginners. invest couple of dollars in Fame ster and save yourself from stressing. I was sceptic and scared for may channel but it is completely safe. Cheers!,True
@Mirko-Peters,2023-11-09T06:52:21Z,1,"I've just finished watching your video on starting a data-focused YouTube channel, and I felt compelled to reach out and express my gratitude for the insights you've shared. As someone who has been contemplating the idea of launching a similar channel, your advice and guidance have proven to be invaluable.  Your approach to breaking down the process into digestible steps was particularly impactful. You didn't merely suggest ""starting a channel,"" but instead provided practical guidance on identifying a niche, crafting engaging content, and effective methods of promoting a channel. Your honesty when discussing the challenges one might face, such as finding motivation and overcoming the fear of exposure, was truly appreciated.  Your emphasis on authenticity resonated deeply with me. Instead of advocating for mimicry of successful channels, you champion the idea of discovering our own unique voice and style. In my opinion, this authenticity is the key ingredient in creating a distinctive and captivating channel.  One enlightening point you made was about the importance of having a content plan. I agree that a clear roadmap for the channel not only fuels motivation but also ensures the consistency and relevance of the content. This is something I'm keen to incorporate into my own strategy.  In conclusion, your video has provided the impetus I needed to kick-start my own data YouTube channel. Your evident passion and enthusiasm for your work are infectious and inspiring. Thank you, Alex, for generously sharing your knowledge and experiences with us. Your video has not only equipped me with valuable techniques and strategies but has also reignited my motivation to embark on this exciting journey.",True
@hiteshdagar5430,2023-11-05T05:34:46Z,1,Hey Alex just wanted to give you a huge shout for imparting me knowledge and confidence to go and build my own tableau portfolio and get employed. You are doing a commendable job. Keep on doing the good deed and all the best for future.üòÅ,True
@jungecoder,2023-11-02T13:23:59Z,1,"Thank you, Alex, for the excellent advice! Pretty inspiring! I just started my channel weeks ago. Sometimes I thought I knew something well, but it turned out I didn't. Teaching is really a great way of learning.",True
@ujjwal717,2023-10-28T18:38:36Z,1,It will be really great if you make a video on technical interviews for an entry level data analyst such as what questions are generally asked and a summary regarding the same! Thanks!,True
@Commenttube,2023-10-28T18:08:59Z,2,"Once you decided that you're more of youtuber than data analyst, the content value of this channel is decreasing",True
@Sheniqua_Deshon,2023-10-28T12:49:31Z,0,@alextheanalyst  Not relevant to this post but I can't access the discord platform on analyst builder. It's saying the address is invalid. I'm also having trouble importing the 'world life expectancy' data to MySQL. It imports perfectly to Excel but only imports 25% of the data to Mysql. Any suggestions?,True
@Rapha_Carpio,2023-10-27T07:58:22Z,1,"I'm starting one called Datagnolo in Italian, i'm not hoping to get a lot of views due Italy has only 60 million people, so not many of those will be interested in my content, But I want to do it to practice my data analysis skills and Italian skills.  I did something similar 4 years ago i started a YouTube channel talking about YouTube, and YouTube management in English and helped a lot to improve my English skills I even got clients as a YouTube manager =)   So if you're reading this message, and you're thinking to start a YouTube channel, don't overthink it but don't do it for the views or subscribers, do it for some reason it's more important to you than external approval.",True
@DeanChereden,2023-10-26T09:39:37Z,2,"Exactly the same reasons for starting a channel as me.   I needed a way to force learning but learning in a way you know enough to teach some one, basically a form of the Feynman technique, and document what I learn / create so I have it as a reminder, but also giving back to the data community as I have learnt so much from long running data YouTubers.  Feels great to give back üòÄ  One thing I would add is for anyone starting youtube, it takes time to grow so just enjoy the journey and don't let the early low subs and views get you down. Just keep posting and see if it's something you enjoy first and then decide if you want to do as just a hobby, part time or full time, so you don't burn out.",True

@sandydsa,2023-10-25T05:38:44Z,1,"Great tips!  I like that you provide free options.  I watched another youtuber based in the Netherlands and she had really expensive equipment.  She is also very upbeat like you.  But because of the equipment, I thought, maybe I should save up for those before I start.  Thankfully, this came out and I saw cost_free options.  Well, not entirely free...youtube content creation will still cost time away from other priorities üòä",True

@aumpatil6536,2023-10-24T16:14:55Z,1,"Hello Alex, love your videos.  I've been surfing the internet to gather information about the job role of a data analyst. I have found that DAs are required to interact with stakeholders on the business/operations/finance side of the company, and for this, having ""domain knowledge"" is preferred in addition to technical skills.  Could you please make a video about different domains that DAs can choose to get into, and also suggest some resources to learn about those domains so that we can be job ready.  Many thanks!",True

@tanujitroy,2023-10-24T12:26:09Z,2,Thank you for this video. I think this gonna help those folks who are really interested to create their own channel. I would request you to create a video on ‚ÄúHow to make a resume for data analyst role‚Äù for those who are transitioning from different domains. I have seen people mentioning how much impact they have created to solve the problem (for eg: resulting in a 15% increase in overall productivity).,True
