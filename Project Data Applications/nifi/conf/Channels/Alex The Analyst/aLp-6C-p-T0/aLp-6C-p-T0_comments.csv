@0x007A,2021-07-13T13:20:28Z,4,"The reasons many people get trapped in Course or Tutorial Purgatory are either fear of the unknown (aka taking off the training wheels) or biting off more than you can chew (aka your vision is bigger than your curent skill level).  Fear of the unknown is only overcome by taking action. Accepting the fact that much of your efforts will result in failures and having to learn how to push through day by day is vital. Nobody is perfect but practise, along with hours debugging and correcting those imperfections, increases the odds of acheiving mastery and more importantly being successful. ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" - Franklin D. Roosevelt  Biting off more than you can chew can be overcome by learning how to breakdown a problem into smaller subproblems and tackling the subproblems one by one. Too often courses and even tutorials make the process look disingenuously easy and linear from start to finish. You rarely see the struggle because the creator did all of the hardwork off-camera possibly over an extended period of time or is relying on previously learned hard-lessons.
