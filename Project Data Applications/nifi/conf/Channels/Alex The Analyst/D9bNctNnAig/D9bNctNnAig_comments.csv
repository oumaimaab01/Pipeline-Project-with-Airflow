Like you said, it's great for learning syntax and for beginners who need a lot of spoon feeding.  I am learning Python and SQL on this platform right now.  After a a short video, we jump into these exercises with fill-in-the-blanks without knowing  what server it is using, how to upload datasets into the server, and sometimes what the goal of a problem is.  It takes you to a screen and you just starting filling in the blanks. It doesn't reflect real life.

@jvh3588,2021-03-12T22:02:43Z,8,Being a beginner I liked getting the basics and found the lectures really good. In my experience with just about every sql course on data camp I took I was disappointed with the ability to practice recall. They basically give you a template to fill in the blanks which isn’t super helpful if you’re not thinking about what and why you should be using something. It’s just pretty obvious you need to plug in the previous concept learned. I say it’s great if you have no idea about sql. Currently I’m taking a sql zero to hero course on udemy which I like a lot better in terms of practicing because you use pgadmin and they don’t give you a template to fill in for the challenges. Using the actual programs is so helpful on figuring out how you’d be using sql in the real world.  I would like to give the projects another go when I have a better grasp.,True

I worked really quickly through most of the course, but faced some burnout. I was unsure if I was actually absorbing the material, but luckily they have exams you can take, and I've seen improvement in my scores despite not always feeling super confident.

@lucad6649,2021-01-22T09:40:54Z,0,Did you see Kevin Tran talking about you on LinkedIn? It wasn't very flattering.,True
@RajPatel-vz3sl,2021-01-22T04:54:51Z,9,"as a current college student, do you think that getting a certficate from datacamp and putting it on my resume for an internship a good idea?",True
@jacksonwhite1021,2021-01-22T02:17:58Z,19,"Thanks for your review Alex! I'm a beginner at coding and have been completing courses from the Data Science for Everyone career track. I just wanted to add that I was using the free version of Data Camp and after a few days, I got offered a 62% discount code which was for a premium plan. It worked out to be cheaper than the standard plan (like $16 a month for a premium plan compared to $25 for a standard). I don't know if that would change many users mind, but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Love your content and keep it up!",True
@Josh_Koster,2021-01-22T01:37:38Z,7,What's the best way to show employers that you know SQL?,True
@sverma101,2021-01-22T01:32:31Z,1,"Udemy vs Data Camp.   Data Quest is dry, boring, laggy, & slow.",True
@lauragonzalez5584,2021-01-22T00:32:22Z,40,"I once paid just for one month, but it had a discount so I paid like 12 dollars only. Since I'm a beginner, I can say it definitely helped me getting familiar with the syntax (I was learning SQL back then). Now I'm watching your SQL videos which are really helpful!! Thanks",True
@b_rizzle4808,2021-01-21T21:52:09Z,116,i've been using datacamp for a few years now to get into python/sql and learn data analytics and machine learning.   one thing i hate about it is the code exercises are only little snippets so its hard in real life to do something A-Z.   it also feels like you are just going through the motions of completing courses and not actually learning.   it's good to get a basic overview of stuff tho,True
@jhoneduardo15,2021-01-21T19:10:14Z,66,I use datacamp for practice and coursera for theory.. I think both platforms are really useful.,True
@kellarz,2021-01-21T18:30:48Z,2,"I'm enrolled in Penn's Data Analytics certificate and the curriculum is almost solely based around R, and then gets into machine learning. The course also clearly refers to data analysis and data science interchangeably and at one point also said they were the same thing (I know this isn't necessarily true). In this video you seem to be less interested in Data Camp's R modules - what's the reason for that? In your work have you found R is not as useful as, say, Python?   Initially, I enrolled in the certificate to learn skills to become a data analyst, but now I'm wondering if I should readjust to a data scientist path. My big obstacle there is that I don't have a degree. What are your thoughts on this?",True
@jghornet510,2021-01-21T17:10:36Z,0,Thanks for the info on these courses. I was wondering if you can also review the “Job Ready Programmer” course by Imtiaz,True

@chasehuang3061,2021-01-21T16:13:42Z,3,"Good morning, Alex. Are these projects able to show it in the resume when we are looking for an entry-level job? Also, what do you think Udacity? cause they offer much cheaper course compare to other Bootcamp. Have a wonderful day!",True
@samsondamilare6877,2021-01-21T16:05:09Z,9,I'm glad i subscribed after i watched  your  video of Data Analyst vs Data Scientists. I knew you'd be reliable when it comes to being informed in this area. VERY helpful!,True
@MrHazelplank,2021-01-21T16:02:46Z,7,"Hi Alex, really appreciate all your content. I was wondering if you would be able to make a video about working on projects as a way of practicing and demonstrating your skill set as a data analyst?  Cheers",True
@Dylan-zm3ht,2021-01-21T15:27:30Z,0,I don’t like the teaching style. Brief overview and then you learn through text mainly and are forced to write code in the exact way they want. So if you Alias something as languages instead of language you got it wrong. Not the way I like to learn personally.,True
