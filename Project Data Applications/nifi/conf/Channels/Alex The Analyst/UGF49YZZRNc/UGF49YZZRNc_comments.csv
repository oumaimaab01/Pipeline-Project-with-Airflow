@asher_fawad,2023-10-13T17:36:53Z,0,"How about this combo?   SQL, Python, Tableau   or SQL, R, Tableau?  But I feel these 3 are not enough. You should have spreadsheets under the belt as well (both google sheets and excel). There is a redundancy of skills here from my point of view and that is because I am speaking as an outsider. At the moment, I don't know how companies actually utilize these above skillsets.  SQL can manipulate  large amount of data  very quickly and efficiently so there should be no need for excel manipulations. Once data is cleaned in SQL and ready for analysis, it can be imported in Excel for whatever reasons (for reports, to share with management) so you don't need Excel that much (of course it is good to have the deep skills in it). Similarly, what is Python used for? Mostly for automation, doing complex ""calculations"" fast. They say it is used in data science model (like numpy etc) [I am not familiar with it yet]. I am learning Python at the moment and doing the object oriented part but not sure if OOP is really needed for data analysis.  Tableau, you defninitly need. It produces very good visualization. One should go deep in it. The google sheet chart capability sucks.",True

You channel helped me to get a bird-eye view on Data-analysis related field and build some kind of strategy of learning skills for a new job.

I‚Äôm a data analyst but most of our work is on sheets :(   I‚Äôve studied MySQL  rigorously and know JOINs, SubQueries (in SELECT FROM AND WHERE STATEMENTS) but most my knowledge is in SELECT functions.
