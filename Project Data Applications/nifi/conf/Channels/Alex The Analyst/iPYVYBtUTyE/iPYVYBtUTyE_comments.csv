@JuanPerez-iu9vk,2024-04-19T14:24:30Z,0,"Hi Alex, great job you are doing in your channel, thank you very much. I just wanted to say, if it might help anybody who is watching you  (because I believe that you already know it after two years), that a correlation measures the reaction of one value against the movement of another value. For this, both values need to be able to move and get bigger or smaller, something that letters (and names, in consequence) cannot do, neither can letters or names disguised as numbers, because those are static too, hence, the ""non numeric"" correlations showed in the video, are false.   This problem could just be a mess up in any project, but, in a project that is our portfolio, our showroom, it will only show how much of a data analyst we are NOT.   Kindly study a work around to this statistical problem, which is not to change letters by numbers. So many great developers behind Pandas would have implemented it many years ago. 😀",True

Although the data has been updated and some of the methods in this video do not work anymore, it is a fantastic guidance (and, ultimately, to become good at something, you have to do a fair share of self-study).    One thing to note though: I don't think the pearson correlation coefficient can be used to check the relationship between a categorical and a continuous variable. So, the low correlation coefficient for company, for example, might be misleading.

@woahnelly3286,2022-10-27T14:03:46Z,56,"Hey all, just a ""stats"" heads up/correction you might want to make for your portfolio:  In this video, Alex wanted to see if the company was ""correlated"" with gross revenue. What he did was assign values (randomly, I think) to companies, countries, etc. Then he tried to see if those values were related to the gross revenue.   Those randomly assigned values are ""measuring"" the company, country, etc at the Nominal scale. In other words, they're essentially just being used as a numeric ""name""—the values themselves don't mean anything. What that means is that one value being higher than the other doesn't represent an increase in the thing being measured (for example, the USA was assigned a 54 and the UK was assigned a 53. Those are just names... the USA isn't one more of something than the UK).   Because the values themselves don't represent anything, it doesn't make sense to do a correlation with them.   Correlations tell us, as one variable increases, what happens to the other? So in the first question, as the budget increased, what happened to revenue? It increased. But with country, company, or other categorical variables, correlations don't make sense. The values for country and company are random, so the numbers that represent them going up doesn't tell us anything. It's no wonder then, that the correlations weren't large.   Instead, it would make sense to do a t-test or ANOVA and compare means. In that case, the question would be, ""Do some companies tend to produce higher revenue than others?"" Or, ""Do some countries tend to produce higher revenue?"" etc. (For more discussion, see: https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/519/Correlation%20between%20a%20nominal%20(IV)%20and%20a%20continuous%20(DV)%20variable.html).   Since this is a portfolio project and you want to show potential employers the result, maybe just take that part out—you wouldn't want to make a mistake like that in an application to a potential employer!

We know money shouldn't be int64, but float, cause even if all the values are iguals to 0 after the comma, one day we can receive a not rounded value.

I do have a question about that....: when you did .cat.codes in the cells above, how did the category values of the previous objects (company, country, director) represent any value that can be correlated? For instance, using one row as an example, I'm confused how index 6380 at the top of the dataframe has a company categorical value of 1428. Is this by random or did the code construct some sort of logical thinking and gave a numeric value based on other data patterns?? ....
