@goldengriffon,2021-08-13T18:17:13Z,2,"Wait...so, you just jumped over from doing unskilled labor to doing data analysis for them? This was glossed over too quickly, as it reveals a huge truth about getting a job. It's more about WHO you know than WHAT you know.  I assume your data analysis skills at the time were less than one would expect for an entry-level person to normally get hired with, but you were able to break into the data analysis field because they already knew and liked you. And after that, having some actual data analysis work on your resume gave you a huge leg-up in applying to other jobs via more traditional methods.  I'm just not convinced the data analysis field is all that good of an opportunity for most people. It seems most data analysts either transition into the role in their current job, or go through an internship as they're wrapping up college. Meanwhile people like me trying to start a new career are a dime a dozen; people with just the basic skills and certifications, being ignored by potential employers, and drowning in a sea of competition.  Whenever an entry-level data analyst job opens up online, within mere hours there are hundreds of applications already submitted. It seems rather hopeless, unless one happens to have a connection already with the company. :/",True

Exercise science is considered a useless degree by many and I'm probably one of many that are living proof. I made 16k in 2018, and a whopping 18k in 2019!  I've had had seven jobs the past three years, with five of them paying at or near minimum wage. Another job was personal training. I could not sell my way out of a paper bag to make that gig work. I also had a part time teaching job at a community college but was not selected for rehire the following year. Now, I have been self-teaching myself the skills needed to get into data science for the past year. My goal is to gain an entry level data analyst job so I can build my skills more and put myself through college again to pursue a quantitative degree.  Gaining an entry level data analyst job where I make even 40k would be like winning the lottery! Earning 100k, I might probably feel like I died and went to heaven. Why?
