@kadaddle,2023-08-14T19:42:04Z,0,Thank you for this video! StrataScratch was a HUGE help in 1) keeping my SQL skills sharp while I'm working through job applications and 2) helping me prepare for the technical interview questions. I'm able to do both of these things using the Free version of StrataScratch.,True
@spiffyjass,2022-05-03T23:03:00Z,0,"Important question please, do you recommend using this site only knowing the basics of SQL and then just learning more SQL through trial and error here ?",True
@NathanEckelTV,2022-04-15T14:26:49Z,1,"(Longer comment, because this is so relevant to me right now both as an instructional designer who's added data analysis to the mix:)  After having my first couple of technical interviews, this is invaluable @Alex.  Candidly, this is a completely different world from an artificial environment such as a DataCamp or other fill-in-the-blank approach.  Filling in blanks does not teach our brains to demonstrate the real-world competency that our future team is depending on from us :)  In learning engineering lingo, we call this disconnect the difference between the ""learning context"" vs. the real-world ""performance context"".  The goal of solid training is to first teach the basics but ensure that learners demonstrate mastery (whether basic or advanced) in a real world context.  In the case of those of us who want jobs in this field it will be necessary to communicate what is going on in our brains just as you do in this video.  To be super transparent with you and others reading this... In my first such interview I candidly felt like a 2nd grader learning phonics and sounding out words... which was an unpleasant feeling to put it mildly.  Having to ""talk through"" a completely new SQL problem in real-time is very much a performance, and having a way to simulate this in real-time would be helpful.    You demonstrated this competency in this video, and that helps to a significant degree. Some sort of service or ""fishbowl"" style masterclass could also accomplish this.    The ""community answers"" feature in StrataScratch is new and very helpful as there is more than one solution to these issues.  Live ""Fishbowl"" style webinars (one person answers while others observe) or even asynchronous video submissions which could be reviewed within 72 hours or whenever could provide invaluable feedback in addition to forcing us to go through the real life situation that most job seekers will face.",True
