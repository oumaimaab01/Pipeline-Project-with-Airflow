@cindystokes8347,2023-06-02T13:43:43Z,0,I have a linguistics degree and I HOPE employers recognize that as as an analytical degree. But most people don‚Äôt understand what the degree is.

My real name on ID ABDIRAHMAN MOHAMUD SAID OSMAN but it shows wrong name after ID verification. That shows ABDIRAHMAN SAID instead of showing ABDIRAHMAN MOHAMUD SAID OSMAN.

Also, the name on my old certificates it my proper name have been changed in to ABDIRAHMAN SAID . I am not satisfied with this, because I can't use this certificates if they are not by my real name.
