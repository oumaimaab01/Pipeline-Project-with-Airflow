I have 2 questions:  I have a BS in Finance, 14yrs of Banking experience, 16yrs of Restaurant Mgmt. and because of Covid I was let go and I have decided to pursue the IT Path. After applying for a random good online IT school back in April 2020, I am set to finish school end of Jan 2021. However i am seeing that all these certifications I am retrieving are basically just pushing me into the Tech/help desk areas. I want to do Data Analyst as of last month. I found a online school that will BOOT CAMP me for 4 months with them (part of their payment structure ) will find me a job but take a % from my 1st month salary. 1) How do you feel about IT Boot Camp Schools in general and with those strategies ? 2) Do I just hustle myself with learning the SQL, Python, etc all the basics, scrub the resume and hit the normal traffic of job hunting?

@lynwoodproductions9654,2020-03-30T04:37:26Z,4,I enjoyed the video! I know a fair amount of sql however I dont know what I dont know. How much sql knowledge is expected from me or how advance of a query is expected for me to be able to execute in a data analyst position or what would an employer expect from me as a junior/entry level hire in the sql aspect of it. I know different positions ask for different responsibilities but is there a minimum threshold of knowledge that an entry level should know across all data analyst jobs? My background is from a coding bootcamp where I learned python and sql for data science and I'm trying to land a first position as a Data Analyst since I found that it is usually the most efficient path to get experience in data analytics for data science without work experience in it.,True
@Ravi-ut7kk,2020-03-26T14:52:37Z,5,1. does your company offer stand up desk? I can't imagine sitting all day doing this role and would need a stand up desk. I would think many data analytics role offer this perk nowadays.  2. how often do you get to work from home as a data analyst if they offer that option?,True

@ceez4235,2020-03-17T15:49:26Z,0,Watching you taking care of your family would've added more value instead of watching you taking care of business. Who wants to become a data analyst after watching this? No offense.,True
