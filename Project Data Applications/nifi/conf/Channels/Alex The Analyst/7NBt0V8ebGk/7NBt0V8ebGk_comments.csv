@user-kq3tc5tu1c,2024-05-14T03:36:08Z,0,"Yet another ""WOW!"" lesson for me.  Don't think I've ever gotten to WINDOW Functions before.  Very cool.  I suppose it will all start to make more sense once I start using all of this on a regular basis.  Am REALLY glad I figured out how to run an almost current version of MySQL on my macBook Pro in macOS Sonoma.  Much simpler than using a VM, etc.  Anyway, Alex's courses have always been well worth the time I invest.  Thanks for putting up quality content Alex!",True

Despite it all makes sense when I watch videos, I have hard time to remember these things. So what's your suggestion for making all these knowledge memory, remind it all later as well.
