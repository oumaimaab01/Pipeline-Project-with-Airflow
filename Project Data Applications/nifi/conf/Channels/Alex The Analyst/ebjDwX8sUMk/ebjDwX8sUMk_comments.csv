@TableauTim,2021-10-05T16:54:01Z,35,"Alex great video as always love this series. Filling a huge gap in the Tableau community. I have one bit of critical feedback which is the way you’re using show me to get some final results. It’s generally okay especially for beginners but the issue with it is it obfuscates why the charts work the way they do. For example on your pie chart to box and whisker plot click, it changed the chart but there’s probably about 8 to 10 steps it did for you including adding what tableau considers a reference line and if you don’t clock those steps it’s actually a huge blocker for so many people when they go to build this charts later down the line. As a trainer I see a lot of approaches that people have where they build a chart then use show me but then get stuck on the final mile. I have a video just highlighting this issue here https://youtu.be/nal52Cdnm0o but again this is meant as friendly feedback and I’m being 110% pedantic about this.",True
