@ignacioa3698,2023-05-18T17:44:28Z,0,"So u specifically mentioned and recommended one of the following in your live stream: Tableu DA certificate, Microsoft powerBI DA certificate, and AWS DA certificate. However, how do those certificates you mentioned in the live stream  compare to the Google DA certificate and the IBM DA certificate?  I did research and Google teaches ""R"", whereby the IBM certificate teaches Python.  And I chose specifically and I'm currently doing the IBM because the IBM does Python and thought Python would be better as far as transferable and more widespread program skill.  So how those 3 that you recommended DIFFER from the Google and the IBM certificate?  They better than the Google and the IBM certificate, or they the at the same level as far as educational  and real life practical value?",True
