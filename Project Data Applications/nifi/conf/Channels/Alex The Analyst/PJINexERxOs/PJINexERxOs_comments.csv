@samoh6084,2024-02-01T18:00:49Z,0,I find all the google certificates to be lacking hands on experience... this other certificate I'm doing is done on Ryme which so far has given me so much more hand on,True
@raymondlee8951,2024-01-31T04:04:46Z,1,Hi Alex  Can you do a review of IBM's new Business Intelligence certificate. It uses Tableau,True
@theberg1e,2023-12-14T06:44:27Z,0,What if me or my company does not have the tableau software? Is it possible to do the dashboards with i.e. MS PowerBI?,True
@Tiffany0628,2023-10-27T19:10:34Z,0,Your channel is amazing! New subscriber . Do you recommend taking the data analyst course from Google in conjunction to this or should I go straight into learning skills such as a tableau or power bi course ?,True
@NancyMancarious,2023-10-23T16:42:13Z,1,The difference between a BI analyst and a data analyst is very vague in this Google certificate and is not the norm you'd see being used in the market. They use the term 'BI analyst' but explain the workload of a 'data analyst' and a little bit of 'data engineer'. I'd be grateful if someone could explain clearly how they differentiate between both positions.,True
@Slate-Mate,2023-09-27T06:12:27Z,0,Hi Alex...I have total 6+ years of experience in Qliksense+ SQl and I want to be core data analyst.....I am thinking to take Coursera DA courses  ???? And do you think doing these Courses would help me to justify 4-5 years of Python R experience for job?????...Need your help on this...I am in chaos right now,True

@mortezaahmadi4064,2023-04-20T16:23:35Z,1,"Hey Alex. I have a question. I have been using Coursera specifically Google Professional courses, and IBM and DataCamp so as to do more coding. Also, I have been doing Coursera guided projects as well. My question is which of these two platforms do you prefer: Codecademy or DataCamp?  Should I invest time into Codecademy as well, for example Data Science Machine Learning track or not? (Since there are projects that I can do for the purpose of building a portfolio)",True
@godsoloved24,2023-04-20T00:51:22Z,8,"So one of the biggest issues I have is that after the analysis, I'm supposed to recommend actions based on the insights. The data can show patterns and I can highlight those, but I don't often know what actions to recommend. I did the Coursera Data Analytics Certificate and they briefly went over strategic thinking and business, but I still kinda feel lost while I'm doing the capstone project.",True

@connargocken1437,2023-04-19T17:02:18Z,1,It‚Äôs nice you brought up the hands on aspect. That was something I needed to focus on more when I started learning data. It‚Äôs such a crucial point!,True

@khalafmanaseer3386,2023-04-18T22:24:06Z,2,"I finished the first course, a lot gibberish talk, second course was more technical yes but it kind of felt off with ETL, then I had flu and thats where I stopped  I did around 4-5 hours a day on the first course and finished it in 6 days",True
@manasseho,2023-04-18T18:36:35Z,16,"This certification is really wonderful üòä. I am still on the first course, which is very theoretical and more of a build up from the Google data analytics. I believe it's going to be an interesting journey ü§†",True

@henryegbelo7864,2023-04-18T16:45:12Z,12,"Hi Alex. I'm particularly happy to have come across your YouTube page two weeks ago through a colleague LinkedIn page. I have painstakingly watched your SQL, TABLEAU and Python courses with lots of knowledge gained. I have been managing data for over 10 years with Stata, Excel, Google Data Studio and DataWrapper. I also use Kobotoolbox for data collection. However, your YouTube channel training has reshaped my career. Kindly guide me further as one of your students from Nigeria. I am ready to learn more and get a better opportunity for remote jobs overseas.",True
@Geomaverick124,2023-04-18T14:08:47Z,12,"I was thinking...you may not need a whole lot of projects in some of these certificates. Coursera has a ton of Guided Projects for various tools and applications...Tableau has 26; Power BI has over 50; and SQL has over 180 project courses. I know it is nice to have projects included in the certificate...but if they dont, you have the option of taking some of the course projects on the platform.",True
