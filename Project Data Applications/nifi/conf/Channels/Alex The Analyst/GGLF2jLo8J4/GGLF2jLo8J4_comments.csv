@dark-hobbit,2021-03-18T09:14:16Z,0,"Hi Alex!  Just stumbled upon your channel a few weeks back and am currently binging the videos while working. Say, would you consider Alteryx to be a no-code analytics tool? Because it seems to kind of fit the description, and for one thing I can tell that some big-name audit companies do use it to allow not very tech-savvy employees to handle client's data (including fairly big data). The data's often pretty clean (not always, sometimes it's quite a hassle), but there's still a lot of ETL going on and even rather complex workflows are built in Alteryx before potentially being handed over to a more advanced analytics/development team if needed.  Can be quite useful when preparing data on rudabega sales for further analysis ;)",True

@onsetaugust,2020-11-16T19:02:27Z,1,"Can you tell me if these traits/personality qualities make Data Analyst a good or bad match? For those interested, this is theoretical mumbo jumbo of MBTI's INFJ personality type. IEI and Te-PolR are in reference to me:  IEI: I make lots of little factual errors, don't focus on the little details unless absolutely forced to. I don't care about doing things ""the best way"" unless it's something I really care about. If it's something I really care about, I will slave over it (not Te-polr related, just explaining), and be meticulous and obsessive and perfectionist. If it's something I don't care about, I will literally do a way that takes longer and wastes time and doesn't do the job as well just for the sake of not having to focus on it. I am *so* indifferent to ""optimization"" (that's a Te buzzword).  Te-PoLR have trouble dealing with things in a detached and rational manner. They have trouble focusing on work and tend to have trouble doing things the way things are ""supposed"" to be done, often doing things in a way that is most emotionally stimulating which can be perceived as wasteful of time or resources. They fear that they won't meet objective expectations or that they will be forced to do so.  Te-polr have problems trusting information they're given. They are unlikely to trust unreliable sources of information and make a determination based on anything but personal experience or vision. I've found that often IEI like to have some (what they feel to be reliable) reference material which they will consult when doing something, but often have problems doing research outside of that. They're often quite skeptical of reasonable reliable sources of information that some people find ok. They need someone to explain it to them or someone to do it and prove it in front of them, then they will have some trust of that information.",True
