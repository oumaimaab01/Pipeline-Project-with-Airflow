@Celeste-.-marie,2024-02-23T00:43:26Z,0,"I'm in my grad certificate data analytics program and a recruiter just reached out to me for a role! My first recruiter. I'm incredibly interested but seems a bit above my skill level. I am not sure whether to just go for it or be a little more realistic in what skills are required for the job. After all, you always hear that the job description and requirements are only a ""wish list."" Any thoughts on that? I don't want to embarrass myself for going for a role I'm not ready for yet. The specific job presented to me only stated ""skills in..."" not years of experience. They specifically want EHR experience, which I have in my healthcare provider background. I'm new to navigating this field so I just have no idea what to even expect and how on the job training they provide.",True

I completed Google's Data Analytics course and made several projects and a portfolio but my previous work experience doesn't correlate too much to the field. I have been applying for about 2 - 3 months now with no luck landing any interviews. How can I find a truly entry level position when most require 2 - 5 years? I have even been applying for other roles aiming for a remote position and still no luck. Any other job boards besides LinkedIn or Indeed that you can recommend.
