@z4ofus,2023-10-18T02:55:20Z,4,"Alex this video was sooo helpful and motivating. It would be another great income stream if you could develop a platform for those email requests you have to decline, to be referred out to your students who reach a certain level in your course! Those potential clients could get a bit of a discount for using one of your students and your students could pay you a percentage as a referral fee. We do this in the real estate and mortgage business and it's a great way to build relationships and network. More experienced and busy professionals pass along overflow business to new agents and LO mentees. Mentees get to build experience and are backed by someone trusted, experienced professionals still make income, and client still get's high quality work and experience from mentee who was trained in the way of the Jedi...Seasoned agent! It's a win/win for everyone! Anyway, thank you so much for what you offer to all of us regardless! It's been a huge blessing and so encouraging to see how you've been blessed as well!",True
@IArkProject,2023-10-18T02:30:13Z,1,"Potato 🥔 Alex, I have to say that you have been blessed with so much goodness, and I sincerely hope you are blessed with more. Thank you for sharing, and this is really so eye opening and helpful.   I signed up for a Data Analytics BsC degree with COURSERA for University of London, and you giving me this heads up has given me a road map for later - I'm now teaching myself precalculus, and changing careers at 35 after a career in Paramedicine. And I just wanted to say two things: 1) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for inspiring me with your help! 2) Did I mention POTATO 🥔 ?",True

I'm so excited for Analyst Builder, just waiting for pay day to buy the lifetime one. Part of me thinks that's just ADHD spending, but I've tried and failed other courses, and free courses, and honestly this seems like a really good price, but also enough of a financial sacrifice that I'll actually use it, especially with all the different options if I get bored of one!",True

@Trevorious2010,2023-10-17T12:45:35Z,5,"Congrats on all your success Alex, I love your content because it's bite-sized easy to consume tutorials that teach me practical skills. I'm 36 from Canada and after a back injury, I had to leave the trades and pivot careers which is always scary and exciting! I had been very interested in breaking into the I.T industry for a while now and I was considering a few different things like software developer, network administrator, cyber security and even digital marketing! then I found your YouTube Shorts and was curious. A career that pays well, can be remote so I can someday live abroad! It wasn't long before I could see myself doing this type of work as it's both technical and creative! also I don't have a CS degree so the low barrier of entry was a selling point!  A week after starting your free Bootcamp, I'm now learning the basics of SQL and Tableau! I'm unemployed and pouring 30-40 hours a week into learning and practicing and I hope to be employed by the end of the year!   Thank you for putting in the work to bring us such great content and offering it for free without charging thousands of dollars.  You have my deepest gratitude and respect.
