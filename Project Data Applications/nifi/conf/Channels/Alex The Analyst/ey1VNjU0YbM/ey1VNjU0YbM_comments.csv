@fede77,2023-12-09T14:40:39Z,0,"Hi Alex! Great course! Learning a lot!  Thanks! I know this tutorial for beginners, but anyway I'd like to comment that there's a better approach to the if-elif-elif-elif code (commonly known as arrow anti-pattern) in this case. Having a reference table as the source for the logic allows possible future changes (e.g. if the IBM values change for some reason) WITHOUT having to change the logic of the code, only the data contained in the table would be modified in that case.  Something like this:  ref_table = [ {   0.0 : ""a feather"" },               {  18.5 : ""underweight"" },                {  24.9 : ""normal weight"" },               {  29.9 : ""overweight"" },               {  39.4 : ""obese"" },               {  39.9 : ""severely obeese"" },               {  99.9 : ""morbidly obese"" },               { 999.9 : ""life-threatening obese"" }             ]  name   = input(""Enter your name: "") weight = int(input(""Enter your weight in pounds: "")) height = int(input(""Enter your height in inches: "")) BMI = (weight * 703) / (height * height)  for pos in range(len(ref_table)):     if ( BMI >= list(ref_table[pos].keys())[0] and BMI < list(ref_table[pos+1].keys())[0] ):         print(name +  "", your BMI is "" + str(int(BMI)) + "".
