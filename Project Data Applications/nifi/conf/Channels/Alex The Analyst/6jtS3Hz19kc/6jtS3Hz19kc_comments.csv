@Mark10365,2023-05-20T00:48:12Z,0,I'm totally having problems with Bard. I've had 1 good day with Bard. Now it's just garbage. What happened?,True
@travisporco,2023-05-14T21:40:58Z,0,The *last* thing I want is AI in my search. No way to even begin to understand the biases and SEO that is going to be hiding some things and boosting others. Yet another downspiral for the net.,True
@shooter001,2023-05-14T16:58:12Z,0,If you asked me before you did this I would have told you to do a ketogenic diet then fast.  It makes sense right!,True

@stephencooper3583,2023-05-14T16:06:25Z,0,"Despite all the hype Bard is getting, I'm still finding Bing to be a better product, side by side.  It already does many of the ""new"" features Bard just announced.",True

@softwaremediaguru,2023-05-13T19:25:13Z,6,"Bard is getting better and smarter now, I'm also using and training it, feeding it with correct information, if i happened to spot a mistake. Chatgpt is already ahead of bard when it comes to accuracy, but chatgpt 4 is paid. I currently use both, because bard has the current data and latest news that i need. I don't have access to chatgpt 4 yet. But bard is definitely ahead of bing now. And bing is still stupid and boring.",True
@HaseebHeaven,2023-05-13T14:44:01Z,0,I would wait Google Bard to have plugins and not trust shady OpenAI because they cant let you use Plugins with chat history turned off. The need data why? they sell data?,True
@MiaMoxie,2023-05-13T13:47:06Z,3,"At least as far as coding goes, the code Bard produces for me is often broken or at least not as good as the results I get from ChatGPT 4. So, as an OpenAI Premium Customer, ChatGPT is still leagues better than Bard. It may be better than GPT-3.5-turbo, I am not sure about that.",True
@psychedelicfox4815,2023-05-13T12:51:23Z,3,"bard is nowhere near gpt, is not better and it extremely exaggerates and makes up facts if it can't find what you're looking for. google has been terrible with it's projects and has scrapped countless numbers of them so it's not surprising their AI isn't that great. there's so many google employees out here simping for this too and leave very obviously fake or generated messages about how it's so much better than got but no explanation hoe or it's extremely vague. it's not unusable anymore, but if it's going to make things up then what's tye point?",True
@user-dd7pq2to3o,2023-05-13T12:37:37Z,0,Bard is still pretty twrrible for cosing. Ive gried to get it to make simple models of physical phenomena like magnetic feilds and it continually returns code with undeclared variables and nonsense symbols. Atill needs a bit of work i think,True

@mhmdshalan8081,2023-05-12T17:26:12Z,1,"Hello Alex, I have been watcing ur videos are learning from you and you were one of the main inspiration for me to get into this profession when I was so many times before thinking of learning data analytics. You were the one who inspired me. Now I reached to the phase of doing actual projects and practice. I wanted a mentor or some advice in doing the projects and I know that u do not have the time to do so. if you could just give me a brief answer that I would get the idea and move on from it. i took the google certificate and they have some sort of steps to ask, prepare, process, analyze etc. I heard that when starting a project I must draw some guidelines or roadmap for myself to work on but as soon as I start SQLing I start to get many different questions because I am trying to analyze and the more I analyze the more I get questions to that need answers. how can I write an effective roadmap for myself so that I don't get lost",True

@kayd7218,2023-05-12T16:26:24Z,0,"You said in the video that you have been using Google Bard for the past couple of weeks and that it has replaced your need for GPT 4 plus subscriptions. However, Google added the PaLM 2 model to Bard on Wednesday. How did you get better results with the older model? I had early access to Bard and I used it until recently, but it wasn‚Äôt that great. I agree that the new model is better than the old one, and that Google has created many useful products that will compete with ChatGPT and Bing AI. But I don‚Äôt think that Bard is better than GPT 4 overall. It is better in some ways, but not all. Maybe their Gemini model will be better, since bard  is free like Bing chat and ChatGPT 3.5. I think that Bard with PaLM 2 is stronger than ChatGPT 3.5 and it is good enough to use instead of Bing in some cases.",True

@richardnwachukwu234,2023-05-12T14:21:32Z,14,"Just like SEO, Google Bard will need at least 6 months to get trust from users. Chatgpt already got the Authority! It'll take time and a lot of input for us to get to trust google Bard",True

@123arskas,2023-05-12T13:52:01Z,2,Bard is really good but it gets confused when it comes to analyzing links. I gave it your video link and Bard thinks it's a Ted Review. Then I gave video link of Dr. Eric Berg and it got confused again.  I asked it if it's a relative of ChatGPT to which it said that they're both children of OpenAI üòÖ,True
