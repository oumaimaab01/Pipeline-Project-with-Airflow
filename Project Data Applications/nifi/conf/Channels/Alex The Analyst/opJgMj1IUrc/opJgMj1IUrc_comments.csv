In Europe region, middle age people in between 30 to 55 year age bracket and specifically from middle class background bought majority of bikes.   Females bought more bikes as compared to males. Also single people bought more bikes as compared to their married counterparts.   People who live in range of 0-1 miles boughts majority of bikes, and sale of bikes declined as the distance increased.  2. In North America Region, middle age people in between 30 to 55 year age bracket and specifically from upper middle class background bought majority of bikes.   Males bought more bikes than females, also in NAM region married people bought more bikes than single people.   In NAM region also, people who bought majority of bikes lives within 0-1 miles range, and here also sales declines as the distance increased.   3. In pacific region, again middle age people specifically from upper middle class background bought majority of the bikes.  males bought more bikes than females.   the distance pattern here is different, people who live in 5-10 miles range bought most bikes and people who lives in 0-1 miles range bought little less than that.    Conclusion :_  Age, Income, and Distance are the factores influencing most of the sales. People belongs to middle age category with middle class background who lives under 0-1 miles range tends to buy more bikes.",True

@vectortonto1,2022-11-21T04:11:12Z,0,Alex I don't know if this has been mentioned but if you want a custom sort there is a technique to drag the value down in the pivot table.  I found it because of this very issue You hover over the line till you see UpDown and RightLeft arrow on the line you want to move and you drag it down. Cool thing is it remembers it when you refresh the data. I had a date one time that would never sort correctly so I googled till I found the solution.

@danieseadams1642,2022-05-27T14:31:18Z,19,Hey Alex. This was an amazing tutorial. For the 10 + Miles portion you could have just dragged the column down to the bottom vs renaming. You have to click on the cell right near the bottom border and the cross sign will turn into an arrowed cross sign. When you see the arrowed cross sign just drag it to where you want it and it will bring the corresponding cells to where ever you choose to move it.,True

@hongeeleow7506,2022-04-09T18:50:33Z,1,Great video! did some further analysis and noticed people who had no car and have more than 10 miles of commute purchased the fewest number of bikes. One reason could be that people usually buy bikes for short distance leisure commutes. They might prefer to use public transport for longer distance commutes if they don't have a car. This then made me curious to find out which commute distance had the highest purchase threshold. Highest % of Europeans purchased for 5-10 miles commute while highest % of North Americans purchased for 2-5 miles commute. People in the Pacific seem prefer shorter commutes,True

@DrDemolition,2022-03-24T05:34:46Z,8,"I recently started Google's DA course on Coursera based on your recommendations and I found this video really helpful!  However, I had a few questions while I was watching the video  1. Is there a better way to categorize ages? Nested Ifs will not be ideal if you have more than 3 categories.   2. I don't quite understand the placements for categories in the pivot table, how do I know where to place the categories among rows, columns and values? From what I understand, values is what you want to visualize and rows and columns are interchangeable, is that correct?  3. Charts! Line chart felt really off for bikes purchased vs commute distance because it's supposed to be used with data that changes over time, stock price for example, and I thought that it didn't really provide any good insight. Wouldn't a bar chart or stacked bar chart have been better for the commute distance vs bike purchased?   4. Regarding the chart for age bracket, line chart looks really pretty! but I think histogram might have looked better for the uncategorized ages because I aim for line charts only when it deals with variation over time. Any insights on what charts are 'industry standard' or do we just go with what looks best?  5. I recently learned that dashboards are used to provide real-time data analysis and I fail to see how the dashboard you created achieves that. It felt more of a report than a dashboard.

A very small number are adhoc so I end up automating most of my reporting.  It may be helpful to your viewers to make another video where you automate this same report for future data pulls.  Power Query/VBA/SQL/Python are generally my tool of choice, depending on the needs of the project.  One more note on why I think it's important to automate (for any beginners that may be reading).  If you spend all day refreshing reports using a manual process, you'll have no time to develop new solutions for the business.  One more note for beginners.
