I am currently an unemployed recent Economics graduate looking to become a data analyst. After finishing uni I got a job to keep me busy whilst I applied for data analyst roles. However, I struggled to find time and quit my job two months ago to attend a Python boot camp provided by my university which I believed would give me relevant experience to be successful in my applications. So far I am still looking for work whilst working through the SQL videos you have provided. I plan on completing this boot camp you offer, but I am worried about having a gap in my CV during this process. Do you see having CV gaps as an issue when being considered for jobs or is it justifiable considering the situation I have outlined.

@Strova1,2023-03-14T21:35:00Z,1,"This is my first comment since my YouTube account was created years ago. I stumbled upon this video after a rough day where I was really doubting myself and stuck in a rut about what I am doing with my life. I've graduated college but really slacked off during the experience and never felt like I learned anything. Data analytics has always piqued my interest but I never gathered up the courage to try one of the paid courses. I have experience with SQL and Python through college but I have mainly forgot most of what I've learned. I will do my utmost best to finish this FREE course in a regular paced fashion and keep my progress tracked.   (I am taking my time slowly with this, maybe spending 1 or 2 hours learning and watching videos everday / every other day. I simply hate grinding out work as fast as possible)  Start Date: 3/14/2023 End Date: 5/1/2023  Milestones:  3/23/2023 - First SQL Data Portfolio Project Done (1/4). This took a couple days for me simply because I had a LOT of trouble actually importing the excel files, this took me a couple hours simply because of tech issues I wasn't sure of. I eventually finished after taking my fair share of breaks whenever I felt myself slacking off. 3/26/2023 - Data Cleaning Done 4/4/2023 - Excel Project Dataset Done 4/7/23 - Tablueau Project Done 4/21/23 - Amazon Web Scraping Done (took a small break) 5/5/23 - Updated Resume and DONE",True

@monicavalentino3026,2023-02-08T03:44:42Z,0,"I was in college taking BS in Medical Technology but on my 3rd year I really feel like something's wrong and I shouldn't be there. I dropped out of my university last December 2021. For the whole year of 2022 I only worked on some side hustles online while trying to figure what I really want to do with my life. Then last September 2022 I saw ""Data Analyst"" in some online course ads. I started searching more about it in YT and found your channel. I really wanted to enroll to that online course but both tuition fee and new laptop costs a lot and we can't really afford it yet. In January 2023 I started watching your playlists in Excel, then SQL and lately I just finished the Power BI playlist. I also got a new laptop through installment plan. Right now I really just have to start working on projects for Excel, SQL and Power BI to have more hands-on experience. I actually decided to save learning Python for later since I'm currently preparing to apply for an entry-level Data Analyst position (they only require intermediate to advanced skill in Excel) but I might start learning Python soon after working on the projects you also posted here. Hopefully I get the position, earn some money and continue learning while working.  You're like a personal mentor to me Alex! I learned a lot from your channel. I still have a long way ahead.

By the way, my goal is to go through the entire bootcamp.  Here is another thought. Since you are good at chunking, maybe do miniature certificates of completions at the completion of projects for each area and then be awarded the Bootcamp certificate after completion of all segments/projects.

Most of the content I had seen in DataCamp regarding data analyst each videos was so long much longer like 4 hours and 6-8 hours even.. I couldn't do them of course because they were so long videos and then multiple choice questions to answer. Now I see your content have very short video not even 10 minutes to some and hardly a few are 1 hour.. and I am really wondering, what on heart do datacamp and other videos have that made them so long unlike yours?? I am definitely gonna check your videos and follow along with all the content from this bootcamp. I just wanna make sure, I get proficient with only these short video lectures, or do I still need to follow long videos which you might have lined in each of these short video content?
