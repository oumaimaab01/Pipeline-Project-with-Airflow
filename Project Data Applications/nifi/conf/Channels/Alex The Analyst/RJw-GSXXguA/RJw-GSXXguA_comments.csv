And regarding Tableau, right now I am doing a Tableau course (  Tableau Fundamentals Skill Track) in Datacamp and it is way better than I expected. A lot of hands-on Tableau exercises and case studies are covered. At the end of each topic, you will be given a problem statement and expected to solve this by using Tableau, this technique is unique and interesting compared to the tutorial video followed by making a chart. When you have time, please check this out and review it.   P.S. I have already finished the Krill Eremenko Tableau courses at Udemy and liked them. But Datacamp course is even better.",True
