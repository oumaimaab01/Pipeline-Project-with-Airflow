I am currently working on a PhD in educational research. Naturally studying in the research field I analyze data so I have some experience in excel, Jasp, and spss. (Not much because I am one semester in) I obviously would need training in some of the other stuff you mentioned in other videos such as power bi and SQL, but my first question would be could I put certificates from coursera on a job resume? And my second question would be that after I finish this degree do many places give you pay raises? I‚Äôm more trying to evaluate my options for when I get out, or before I get out sense I earn a master‚Äôs in route to my PhD.",True

So if you have a family and your kids are the distraction you will get rid of them?? or friends who keep you asking you, you will cut your friendship?? no, it's about time management and how can you squeeze these your goals and ambition in life.

@kae0_o644,2022-05-13T13:51:00Z,1,"Hard agree with physically removing distractions.  Part of what makes distractions so easy to fall prey to is the easy access to them.  If you have to put in more than minimal amount of effort (like looking up a password) to start the distraction, unless there's serious avoidance issues at play you likely won't do that activity. Completely removing options that let you avoid doing what you need to do is a game changer.",True

@harrietdrums,2022-05-10T16:44:46Z,41,"My ADHD went undiagnosed till last year at 27, and even now with treatment, procrastination is always going to be an issue for me. Something that sounds so simple like ""just get rid of distractions"" does not work for me, as I can be distracted by literally anything and everything. If any ADHDers are reading this, you CAN progress but it is a lot harder and you do need to find things that work with your brain - neurotypical advice like ""get a planner"" does not usually work for us.   Data analysis is actually great for ADHD brains as we are creative, problem solvers, we think outside the box, and are great at pattern recognition. Despite the misleading name we also have great attention to detail. I found your channel when I was looking into data as a career, I'm almost done with the Google DA Cert and I just landed my first job in data. I've only been taking this seriously for 5 months.   Alex this isn't to discount your advice or anything, but just reassurance for anyone else here with ADHD - we beat ourselves up a lot for procrastinating and not feeling good enough but it's a result of our disability, our brains are different and we have to work around that.",True

The plan is to continue working on Data Camp with the coding bits and actually start on doing a project or two for my portfolio. The hard part is the actual sticking to the plan.
