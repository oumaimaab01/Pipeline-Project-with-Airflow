@Helloimtheshiieet,2023-04-15T14:10:26Z,1,"Bad example on partition by... but everyone on YT copies one another and gives non-realistic examples. For anyone reading for people who actually work with  SQL. Partition by in a Nested join subquery will give you a count when grouping by something different or you can use it in the outer. For example 5 nested tables 1 primary table nested (from table). The partition by in the outer you can cntd partition by x,y,z fields to produce a value. For example lets say you are running daily dates and want a count distinct by accounts etc. You will 100% not get the right count. Why? your nested quries are pushing out numbers by day (fine with sums) (Not fine with counts, count distincts). Essentially you are counting distinct daily and it must be dealt with inside nested query + out or in the outer. These things are what should be covered. However, instead you get people who i'd suspect don't know anything about SQL and downloaded some videos and copied it over to their own version. Anyone rushing over partition by trust me close their video. It's massively powerful and in all honesty one of the most important functions along with LAG/LEAD that you can possibly grasp. Especially aggregating up/down across multiple timeframes. Once again real job vs playing around pressing play for kids on youtube.",True
