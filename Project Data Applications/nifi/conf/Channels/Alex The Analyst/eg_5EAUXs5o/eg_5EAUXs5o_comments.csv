@michaelrobinson8382,2023-06-19T22:30:35Z,0,That has been my biggest issue trying to pick a domain. Finance is my first idea or healthcare. I do a lot of reading but I'm leaning towards finance/fintech,True
@DrNawal-er1fl,2023-03-09T14:21:31Z,0,Thanks a lot ALex,True
@sr-xd8jb,2023-01-05T01:13:04Z,1,"I am transitioning to data science right now. I am not interested in any domain but I got one opening at a sports analytics firm in Berlin. But there are very few players in the market of sports analytics and only one in entire Germany. So that means, less room to switch jobs for salary hikes and chances of boss turning toxic due to  domain niche would be more. So I would target more generalist domains like banking or audit where tones of players are there in the market. More room for growth and I will have a parachute ready incase work place turns toxic.",True
@alpdemirkor6251,2022-12-10T13:01:47Z,1,"Thank you very much Alex for making a great and instructive video regarding a topic which often ignored in other data related channels. It was really beneficial.  Have a really quick question on this topic: As you know there are many data consultancy firms which offer services to a many clients from a wide range of topics. Do you think these firms are better place for a Jr. Analyst position as you could get experience with different domains? Then, perhaps after 2,3 years you could focus on the ones you like most.",True
@WoodrowWoods2007,2022-07-01T01:20:48Z,0,"Ah, ok. By ""domain,"" you mean industry. Which industry or type of business you want to be an analyst in. I was thinking you were going to talk about technical domains and to specialize early in a combination of machine/platform/languages. Like, chose Windows or Mac, then choose Google of Microsoft, and then choose their preferred suite of tools. Get good in one combination before you branch out into something else. Does that make sense? Or should you just git gud at it all?",True
@timbatman1958,2022-02-16T02:43:03Z,0,"As devils advocate, a mistake you can also make is choosing a domain too early. If you specialize too early in a young career, you can limit your opportunities down the road. I think there is a balance.",True

@dataanalyst7103,2021-11-17T20:37:00Z,0,"I would be wary of throwing salary numbers without considering cost of living, size of company, reputation of company, etc. I'm an incoming Data Analyst at a large company making $100k, first time in the domain, with 1.5 of total YOE.

@hellskullz,2021-10-20T02:12:49Z,0,Hey Alex! So I'm currently an HVAC tech and I started looking into data analytics as a full time career. I am going to be enrolling in Google's data analyst course as well as doing a python course and 365 data science course on udemy. My two major questions are: what domains would you say are the best paying ones and what are some other areas or skills that would be good to study to put on a resume? I do have a couple years of coding (C and C++) experience from university but nothing else really skills related that would make me stand out on a resume from all the other Google course candidates.,True
