@frederickzoreta6617,2023-06-09T19:23:06Z,2,"Great review & feedback Alex !  I myself am a data analyst who used to be a digital marketer / traditional marketer.  This entire Coursera Specialization is highly geared ONLY ( as Alex already stated) for those wanting to be in the Marketing Analytics space. I‚Äôd also like to add a few things:  1. Even if you‚Äôre a generic or non marketing analyst, having digital marketing skills is still a good add on or even as a part time / side hustle .  2. For this like me going into Marketing Analytics, this entire specialization gives you a FREE VOUCHER for the META certification exams.    Good luck everyone üòéü§ì.",True

@annamatinyan21,2023-02-25T12:30:19Z,10,"I really loved the course 3 of this certificate, I absolutely didn't feel any inconvenience about a bit dark background of the instructor, his manner of presenting the material was quite good and the content itself seemed great to me. This course sparked my interest for statistics and motivated me to take an in-depth statistics course. Actually, Google Analytics certificate is missing statistics completely (I'm right now in the last course of it) and in my opinion it is hard to do a thorough and in-depth  analysis of data without the knowledge of statistics. So I would really recommend course 3 to those who have completed Google analytics certificate.",True

I have the data background and general marketing knowledge, but not much experience in specific marketing analytics techniques - that part of this course may be interesting!",True
@VictorsOtherVector,2022-07-01T15:25:15Z,5,"Hey, I'm that ""character"" from the 2nd course! üòÑ Only watch 7:20 to 9:35 (especially @8:50), the part where it's about me & my part!   But more seriously, a buddy of mine follows you and I just so happened to check you out via them where I saw this review of the Meta course I helped build! I won't comment too much about the course & your review but I will say I think it's fair coming from a data analyst and there's always room for improvement for the team.  I actually work full-time as a data scientist / machine learning engineer but I teach & help develop technical courses on the side. But I usually go the ""off-camera"" route or do live recordings (I used to be a data science instructor / curriculum developer at a boot camp, Flatiron School, where I would do live lectures). Frankly, it's nice to hear your relatively positive comments on the part I helped build and lead!  I personally try to constantly improve (maybe my ""stage presence"" could be better üòâ) but I won't lie and say that it didn't make me feel proud that you generally liked my section üòÑ I could easily see creating a whole course from just a couple weeks of the Python section, but of course there are real world restrictions & limitations that come into play in building a full course like this. And I am obviously biased towards my section since it's what most closely what I do in my day-to-day lol  Anyways, thanks for sharing your opinions in this review! I know everyone on the team & I are always looking to improve! I've been wanting to go back and make more explanation YouTube videos on data science, machine learning, and software development so this has personally been helpful!  I couldn't ask for a more honest and independent review from a data analyst! Keep it up!",True

@andrewgus8763,2022-06-28T23:23:42Z,5,"Thank you for the review Alex. But I wouldn‚Äôt touch anything that comes out of Meta. Their massive corruption and lack of ethics really disvalue the reputation of their ‚Äúcertified exams‚Äù and may even hurt your resume. There is a reason why they ditched their Facebook name. Besides, it is better to go for more technical certs offered by actual colleges, better experience and knowledge.",True

I found them content to be pretty basic as well, very introductory, I stopped the course and started studying for the Marketing science meta certification by myself (I already have knowledge in statistics, Python and data modeling) by watching the blueprint videos and lectures. I passed at my first attempt, and I can say the most important thing is to understand the basics of Facebook products for data analysis, hypothesis, interpretation of MMM models, conversion and brand lifts.",True

@desafiodatascience,2022-06-28T14:44:13Z,9,"Thanks for the review Alex!  Since I started my journey in the Data Analytics field, I have the feeling that Udemy courses made by ""expert individuals"" are more practical and better suited than those from big universities or companies.   I am currently half-way the DA Google certifcate and although it is very well explained and the content goes straight to the point, it feels a bit slow and full of  things that in my opinion are important but secondary such as: communication, CV preparation, ethics... I had another bad experience with a popular Javascript course from Hapwkings University...  Whereas other courses that I took about Python and ML taught by particulars are more focused on the skills.   I guess we have to balance the possibility to get a valid certification and the actual content we learn.   Thanks again, love your content!  Carlos.-",True

@gkoranath4525,2022-06-28T13:21:47Z,6,I disagree with the part where you said clustering is not related to marketing analytics... A lot of companies do use clustering for customers segmentation before they ads. I am not sure abt the context in this particular course though.,True
