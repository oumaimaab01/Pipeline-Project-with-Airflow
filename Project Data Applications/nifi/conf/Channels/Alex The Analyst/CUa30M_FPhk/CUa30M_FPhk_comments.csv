@Jsl_516,2022-03-08T07:27:00Z,2,Cant believe YT recommended this video to me today as I just finished a multiple offer situation for a senior data analyst this week too. I had a similar choice between a senior analytics consultant role with a major financial institution but ultimately chose to take a senior analyst role with a start up. I think it‚Äôs really crazy how much the salary bands for data analyst has clearly changed in the last year or 2 with the advent of remote work. Some of the start ups are legit throwing engineer money at senior analysts just to stay competitive with these big fortune 100 companies. Happy to hear that it worked out for you and I hope my new gig will be everything that I want it to be too. Cheers on a great video! Subbed,True

We cranked out a response and sent it in before the deadline. We were then informed that we were one of two finalist companies. My company was small but comprised of well known leaders in the field; a boutique, specialist firm.   We were invited for an interview along with the remaining competitor who turned out to be PwC. We walked in and they were immediately ""Oh, it's you!"" They were going to ask interview questions - using my book as the reference! They saw the other person I brought with me and they knew him well too; I planned it that way. We got the deal. Later, for marketing research, I asked the client where PwC was judged to be better than us. They said that PwC had ""really nice brochures...""",True

I decided to quit a Data Science Master's Degree that I enrolled on online after I found out about all the other resources like Khan Academy and Udemy through you.

@chrism3790,2021-09-03T20:54:54Z,29,"120k a year is pretty low for a *_senior_* consultant in a technical role, especially for a really large consulting firm like PwC.  Consulting is a notoriously intense line of work. Despite what they told you in the interview, you always go into those jobs knowing you're going to be working long hours. They know that and they compensate you accordingly. They retain you with money, not by making you happy. And you end up having to sacrifice plenty of things if you want to keep that salary.  The fact that you don't know this makes me feel you would have burnt out quickly because of misaligned expectations. There just aren't enough hours in a week to run a youtube channel, spend time with your family, sleep _and_ have a consulting job.",True

@XpatJohn,2021-08-28T02:48:43Z,6,"Congratulations on the new managerial position!  I just started at one of the big 4 about a month ago.  My interview process was pretty much identical, though I am in a different tech related field.  One of the reasons why they are SO into domain knowledge rather than technical knowledge is that, to be honest, there are hordes of people who can do the technical part, but it is more difficult to find someone who can sit in front of a HUGE client and really dig out all of the details of the project from them.  Then that same person needs to relay that information to the developers so they can do the coding work. Consultants, at the big 4 level, are more advisors and SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) than coders.   If anyone has any questions about what it is like to be a consultant in the big 4, I would be happy to share my experiences.",True

If a recruiter is pushing for a number, I'd ask the recruiter what the salary range is for the position and will just say yes or no if that range is worth moving forward (without them knowing if you are jumping with joy or they need to hit the top of the range to get you :) but this way you still get the desired result of both of you knowing you aren't wasting anyone's time.
