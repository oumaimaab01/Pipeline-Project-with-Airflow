@countdowntorevolution9986,2024-02-23T11:42:34Z,0,"In the UK Data Analyst has basically evolved to mean ""basic office administrator"", which is causing all sorts of confusion on the job market.    Took me a while to work out that the ""Data Analyst"" jobs I was being put forward for were really just clerical roles that called for no coding or even formula skills.  And Business Analyst can often mean someone who looks at the bigger picture - how systems of procedures all work together (although again sometimes denotes a quite basic operational admin role)",True
