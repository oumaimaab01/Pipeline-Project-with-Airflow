I was up skilled in sql and ms excel but no practical work exp on this, it doesn‚Äôt really feel motivating because the impact isn‚Äôt that big since I‚Äôm basically at the core. Knowing this and comparing the market and what skills they require  for analyst i felt lost and confidence died down. I don‚Äôt know how to fill that gap or where to start. Where do you think i should start? I liked sql (i have coding bg web dev but haven‚Äôt done python yet), i like solving problems, does this sound machine learning or analytics or data scie?

I happened to be a veteran with an opportunity to purse a credential in Data Analysis and really would not have had any clue to these critically important points you raise.  This is a highly valuable video and I am so glad you chose the title you did because if you search the internet and Youtube courses and certificates in Data Analysis is all the rage.  One point that did occur to me was that also all these people with entry level training in Data Analytics are hitting the market, and will overpopulate the workforce causing there to be too many entry level DA techs and few with the mid-level and senior experience needed. I already had the same thing happen with training in Litigation Technology eDiscovery. I took a certificate course and because of the need for a certain amount of experience to start 3-5 years I was never able to get a job in the field.  So again, excellent points made in this video that novices in the DA and technology field would otherwise have no knowledge or understanding about.  You have helped me to make a clear decision that a professional pursuit of a career in the Data Analytics field is out.

Took data thinking It was a good set at first glance but then it became clear there had a lot of dirty and bad data that needed a lot of cleaning,  some problems were quite complex like having a row that contained several different kind of marking standards and then trying to extract a normalized year string from that column. Then became the unforeseen values which took a lot of research of the data and then finding out what they should be. Should they be filled with forward fill propagation or left alone? Fake data or risk keeping it the way it was?  Not easy answers, not for someone new like me. Although I have enjoyed it. It is complex, difficult, often you get stuck and it takes a lot of additional research but it is all the same rewarding when you finally get a step closer to what you want the data to look like for whatever use purposes you need it for.

After spending hours I could not find a single advertisement for a job for a data analyst anywhere in my state (population over 20 million).   I found three advertisements for a data analyst in the U.S. and the one that had the lowest qualification requirements requires certification in data analytics, a bachelor's degree and five years experience in the field and pays $39,000 to start.   Google claims that there are over 300,000 jobs available in the U.S. for a data analyst and that the average entry level pay is $67k+ and that all you need is the certificate to get the job.   What am I missing?   Oh and I'm not that worried about getting rich.  I just want a job that pays more than kitchen manager at McDonald's which was my last job.

@nunyabiznez6381,2021-03-11T17:37:59Z,0,There are many kinds of doctors that don't need to see a lot of blood.  Mostly just avoid being an E.R. doctor or a surgeon.   Most oncologists don't see a lot of blood other than via needles and those are mostly handled by nurses.  Radiation oncology specialists don't work with blood at all.  Anesthesiologists don't work directly with blood.  Psychiatrists don't usually work with blood except the occasional patient that likes to cut themselves.  There are others but these are a few good examples and some make an incredible amount of money.,True

@mj1983,2021-01-05T12:16:37Z,0,"Hi Alex, I am really inspired by your story. I have reached a point in my career where I am looking for a change. I am a techie and I feel I can tick off all the boxes mentioned here as I think I do have a lot of patience, analytical thinking skills, and able to self-learn. My entire career survival is due to a lot of self-learning. I have got many years of experience as a web application programmer and API designer but I do not have the skill set of a data analyst. I am very keen to explore this area. This could mean that I may have to turn down a potential promotion because I am not keen to grow further in my current area as I have lost interest in working with APIs non-stop. I have dabbled with databases in the past so SQL is not new to me and I remember enjoying the on and off experiences I have had but never got the chance to work continuously as I was often moved around in web application projects and API development with little say in my work interests. I quickly scanned through your video list and plan to go through each one of them. Do you have a video where you explain how to list audit courses on LinkedIn?

@mikereeves282,2020-08-16T14:53:32Z,139,"I am in an analytics role for a large Corp. I often get tasked with creating analysis on financial data that the financial analysts do not have the technical capability to execute. I primarily use 3 technology components to do this: 1. Writing code to extract data from the source  2. Use of an analytical modeling tool such as SPSS modeler or Alteryx 3. Visualization of the results in cognos   Number 2 in the list above is where all of the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù happens. I feel It allows me to appear much smarter than I actually am. Access and the use of tools like that are key to separating yourself from the many people that have advanced excel skills, which is a large number of people. Hope this helps!",True
@Eddyyc,2020-08-16T02:24:31Z,26,"This is me every day, only one exception, I LOVE to automate the analysis, I love to program the algorithm to avoid 3 or 5 days or work, I am probably addicted to Tylennol, when you are a data analyst must of the time you spend it thinking and writting the problem, testing it once, twice, or more, but just a few of us enjoy the moment when you find the proper algorithm, it is like finding the vaccine fpr covid hahah",True
@konutek7716,2020-08-15T23:15:01Z,1,What frustrates me the most are people who are caling themselves data analysts but in reality they cant do a single shit right. I love to show to those scams how to do things smarter and better. Ofcourse they will never listen coz what did they really master is lying and noding 'yes' to everything.This is the way how they survive. Whole cariers build only on a fact of just having a diploma and spending 10 years in business.  There have to be a place in hell for those people...otherwise I'll just create one. Just wait until I will become a team lead. That will be legendary,True

There are tasks that are difficult and pricey to automate. Doing manual work is inevitable, which is why you need to be strategic in finding ways to optimize your workflow and reduce time to do manual work.
