I bought the Udemy courses you suggested. It's going reasonably well so far.

I have an interview tomorrow morning with a hiring manager at a healthcare company for an entry level analyst position, and this video helped my nerves a bit. The recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn with a couple screening questions after I submitted my application, and then scheduled me for the interview after I responded with my answers. I feel lucky so far as over 500 people have applied.   Now thanks to this video, I’m more excited than I am anxious for tomorrow!",True

@ChronicleContent,2023-07-18T17:13:07Z,0,"good stuff being mentioned but totally untrue in reality for me. First of all, probably most of job postings are fake because I have got more than 300 automated emails rejecting me in the past 8 months with the same exact email format. Second, I got quizzes and tests, I got interviews with HR and then proceed to more interviews with senior people. One was for a tableau junior entry. Even though I am not an expert in tableau I would like to work more on that and I also saw the company as an opportunity to open doors for data career as they were also very open about this. I did okish with the tableau technical question  interview, I didn't answer some steps when I was asked to create multiple visualizations on the fly. However, the tableau expert said it was fine and I might need some further training. Then,  they arranged another interview with data scientists. Even though the job was for entry tableau, I got asked about python, ML, NLP and other data science questions. I only didn't answer 1-2 questions, but I was super motivated and asked about what they particularly do and stuff like this. I also asked them if there is flexibility in the company to change positions say to more data engineering (the interview was more focused in this at that time) and I also mentioned that I have taken course in ML and this direction, and they were even not familiar with MLops.  But I still got rejected. After 3 interviews and tests. And this took more than 2 months. Just a waste of my time and energy. After all this I have no idea how I can even get an entry role. I can't believe that they always find a better fit than me. Unless they are looking for someone who doesn't know anything and just finished college with no portfolio, because apparently I always see people in companies who take training or don't know any of the basics. How did they even get the job? I have friends who didn't take any data science course or knew anything 1 year ago but got a data science job because they knew someone from the company. In the past month, I have not applied to any job. It is so disappointing. Must be something in my face and voice that they don't like, even though I feel like I am super friendly to them and they also seem friendly to me, but they somehow reject me after the interviews.",True

@wilsonman8661,2023-07-18T13:11:46Z,5,"That is exactly what hiring managers do (caveat: n=1!). At my last company, I'd moved to another team but still kept in touch with the original team I started with because I liked them. You could always be pretty confident that anybody they hired would be just like the supervisor who did the interviewing (there were multiple teams on the larger team and the different supervisors had very different personalities 😂). I understand the psychology at play; however, frankly I'm more put off by that kind of thing than people wanting to hire people that want to do the job. To be clear, I'm not particularly put off by either, but if I had to pick one practice I liked less, it would be the former. Mostly mentioning this because I got the impression that you were more ""apologetic"" (for lack of a better word) for the latter. I could be mistaken though!  Anyway, that's a good point about the recruiter screening being a good indicator of what the hiring manager interview might be like. I hadn't quite conceptualized it like that before but it makes sense. :D",True
