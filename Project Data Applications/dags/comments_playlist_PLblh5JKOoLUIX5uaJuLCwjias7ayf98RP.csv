I love how much airtime HyperCard got!  I truly miss it
we&#39;ve started to use LLM&#39;s where i work. training it on tons of very specific research papers (~30 years worth of research) and having a front end where researchers can ask it questions or which papers might have what they are looking for.
Thank you so much Dr. Starmer for your time and efforts!!! Awesome!!! Thank you very much!

I agree with you that AI is becoming more accessible and democratized thanks to online courses, platforms and communities. I also appreciate your insights on how to balance theory and practice, and how to keep learning new skills in this fast-changing field. You are an amazing educator and I love your StatQuest videos too. Keep up the good work! BAM!!! üëè"
"The greatest thing this channel taught me is to look for answers from the books and readings. And I learned a bit about myself: I&#39;d rather read a book which I really hate than to listen to someone try to make unfunny jokes. I really hate your &#39;bams&#39; and songs, have a dislike"
I spent years trying to learn to play tabla! Very cool to see you have a set behind you!
